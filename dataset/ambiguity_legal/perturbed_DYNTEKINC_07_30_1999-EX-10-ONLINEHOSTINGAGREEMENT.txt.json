                "changed_text": "Each party shall endeavor to comply with laws and regulations pertaining to its activities under this Agreement, as it reasonably understands them.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. The phrase 'as it reasonably understands them' further allows for subjective interpretation, creating a loophole where a party can claim a misunderstanding of the law as a defense. This conflicts with the principle of strict liability for regulatory compliance, as ignorance of the law is not typically an excuse.",

Diplomat may, at its own expense, examine and copy those books and records as provided in this Section 4. Such books, records and accounts will be maintained in a manner that allows Diplomat to separate these matters from those relating to Tadeo's other operations. Such books, records and accounts will reflect such information as would normally be examined by an independent accountant in performing an audit pursuant to United States generally accepted auditing standards for the purpose of certifying financial statements, and to permit verification thereof by governmental agencies.",
                "changed_text": "Tadeo will maintain books, records and accounts of transactions relating to the Services. Diplomat may examine those books and records. Such books, records and accounts will be maintained in a manner that Tadeo deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the requirements for 'accurate' records and 'separation' from Tadeo's other operations. Critically, it removes the requirement to adhere to US GAAP standards and allows Tadeo to maintain records 'as it deems appropriate,' creating significant ambiguity and making verification by Diplomat or governmental agencies much harder. This contradicts basic principles of transparency and accountability and may allow for financial misrepresentation.",

                "original_text": "Tadeo and Diplomat each agree to hold in strict confidence, and to use reasonable efforts to cause each of their employees and representatives to hold in strict confidence, all confidential information concerning Tadeo or Diplomat, as the case may be, furnished to or obtained by the other party, in the course of performing the obligations provided for under this Agreement except to the extent that (a) such information has been in the public domain through no fault of Tadeo or Diplomat, as the case may be, (b) disclosure or release is compelled by judicial or administrative process, or (c) in the opinion of counsel to Tadeo or Diplomat, as the as may be, disclosure or release is necessary pursuant to requirements of law or the requirements of any governmental entity including, without limitation, disclosure requirements under the securities laws of the United States or similar laws of other jurisdictions applicable to Tadeo or Diplomat, as the case may be.",
                "changed_text": "Tadeo and Diplomat each agree to respect the confidentiality of information, with exceptions as they find reasonable.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the requirement to hold information in 'strict confidence' and using 'reasonable efforts' with a simple agreement to 'respect the confidentiality of information, with exceptions as they find reasonable', the confidentiality obligation is significantly weakened and made highly subjective. The phrase 'as they find reasonable' allows each party to unilaterally decide what constitutes an acceptable breach of confidentiality, contradicting the purpose of a confidentiality clause and failing to provide adequate protection for sensitive information. This creates substantial uncertainty and is essentially unenforceable.",

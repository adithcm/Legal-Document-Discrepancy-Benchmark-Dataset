                "original_text": "then the Manager shall curtail the Projects of the LIFO Partners. Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners.",
                "changed_text": "then the Manager may consider curtailing the Projects of the LIFO Partners. Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to potentially curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision will be in a possibly sufficient amount to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its potentially designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including some of the Projects of the LIFO Partners.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the mandatory obligation for the Manager to curtail projects when specific conditions are met. Replacing 'shall curtail' with 'may consider curtailing' makes the action discretionary. The phrase 'possibly sufficient amount' lacks clarity and replaces a definitive measure with an ambiguous one, and the phrase 'potentially designed capacity' adds more uncertainty. The LIFO Partner's project is affected by possibly removing all of their projects, which affects their bottom line.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Public Utilities Code, which may require specific performance standards and reliability obligations for power delivery, are undermined by the discretionary and vague language.",

                "original_text": "Such curtailment shall continue until the Manager shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment. If the LIFO Partners shall inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager shall effect any curtailment under these provisions according to such priority.",
                "changed_text": "Such curtailment may continue until the Manager vaguely determines that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners may not possibly result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment. If the LIFO Partners should inform the Manager, if they choose to, in writing of a loose agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager may consider effecting any curtailment under these provisions according to their subjective discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall continue' to 'may continue', the duration of curtailment becomes uncertain. The term 'vaguely determines' undermines the manager's decision-making responsibility, also added 'if they choose to' indicates that there is not obligation to cooperate. By stating 'loose agreement' changes the legal definition of an agreement. The removal of a clear method of determining when curtailment ends and gives rise to uncertainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "California contract law requires agreements to be clear and not subjective, but those terms have been put in place.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager shall in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail. The Manager shall cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "If the LIFO Partners somewhat fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager can possibly use its discretion to generally determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail. The Manager might try to cooperate with the LIFO Partners to try to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any loosely defined expenses in connection with such cooperation may be paid by the LIFO Partners based on an ambiguous payment plan. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, the likelihood of changing to the Transmission Line will be based on the potential unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent can be vaguely withheld.",
                "explanation": "The insertion of 'somewhat fail' makes non-compliance subjective and difficult to prove, and the addition of 'can possibly use its discretion to generally determine' gives the manager the possibility to not determine and make the projects unclear. The phrase 'might try to cooperate' makes the cooperation optional and undermines the effort to eliminate the cause of the curtailment. Furthermore, the payment plans have been altered to not be specific, resulting in further ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires that all contract terms be specific. This contract is clearly going against those regulations.",

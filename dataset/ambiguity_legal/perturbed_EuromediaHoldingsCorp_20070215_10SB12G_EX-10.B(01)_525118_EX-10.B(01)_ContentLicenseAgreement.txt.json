                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use commercial reasonable efforts' to 'will endeavor to provide...when feasible' weakens the obligation. It introduces subjectivity regarding feasibility and doesn't guarantee closed captioning, which may conflict with CRTC regulations regarding accessibility for hearing-impaired viewers.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall ensure that at least 75%' with 'will generally aim for a majority' makes the promotional obligation vague and unenforceable. There is no specific percentage that Rogers must maintain. The 'generally aim' language opens up a large amount of interpretation and does not ensure that obligations are being met.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall reimburse' to 'will consider reimbursing...subject to mutual agreement and available funds' creates significant ambiguity. It transforms a clear financial obligation into a discretionary consideration, contradicting the intention of the original clause. There is no clear commitment that Rogers will be reimbursed.",

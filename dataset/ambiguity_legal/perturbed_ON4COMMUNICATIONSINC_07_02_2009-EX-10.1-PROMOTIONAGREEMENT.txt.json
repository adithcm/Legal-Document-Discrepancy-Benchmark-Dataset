                "original_text": "Charity Tunes shall make its music catalogue available to the purchasers in MP3 file format to the fullest extent that such  format is available to Charity Tunes pursuant to any agreements in effect between Charity Tunes and its wholesalers on the  date of this Agreement. Accordingly, Charity Tunes shall use its best efforts to update its music catalogue with available MP3  files by June 30, 2009.",
                "changed_text": "Charity Tunes will endeavor to make some of its music catalogue available to the purchasers in MP3 file format. Charity Tunes will consider updating its music catalogue with available MP3 files, but no specific deadline is guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear obligation for Charity Tunes to make its music catalogue available in MP3 format and to use 'best efforts' to update it by a specific date. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall make' with 'will endeavor to make some,' 'shall use its best efforts' with 'will consider updating,' and removing the guarantee of a specific deadline. This weakens the obligation and makes it difficult to enforce.",

The landing  page shall feature the Charity Tunes logo in a size and prominence substantially equal to that of Sponsor.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires mutual approval that 'shall not be unreasonably withheld' and specifies the logo's size and prominence. The modified text removes the 'unreasonably withheld' clause, giving each party more discretion to withhold approval, and replaces the specific requirement for logo size and prominence with a vague 'should generally feature.' This weakens Sponsor's obligation and introduces ambiguity about the landing page's design and content.",

Charity Tunes will try to invalidate Pin Codes after maximum downloads have been reached, and generally monitor the total maximum download limits.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains definitive statements for the Charity Tunes system that 'will ensure.' The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'will ensure' with 'will make reasonable attempts to ensure,' 'are invalidated' with 'will try to invalidate,' and 'are observed' with 'generally monitor.' This weakens the obligation and makes it unclear what level of security and verification Charity Tunes is obligated to provide, potentially leading to excessive or fraudulent downloads.",

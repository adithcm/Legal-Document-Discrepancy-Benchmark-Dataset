                "original_text": "Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) months following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees that neither it nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products, nor will Distributor market or otherwise promote the sale of such products. Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

                "changed_text": "Distributor will endeavor to support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting attention, time, and effort as they see fit to develop the available market potential.  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) months following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees that neither it nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without Airspan's informal consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products, nor will Distributor market or otherwise promote the sale of such products. Distributor may give Airspan some form of notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will undertake such representation if Airspan doesn't explicitly object. Except as",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'use its best efforts' is replaced with 'endeavor,' which is significantly weaker and open to subjective interpretation. The requirement for 'prior, written consent' is changed to 'informal consent,' which lacks a clear definition and enforceability. The strict 30-day notice is replaced with a vague 'some form of notice,' making it unclear when and how notice must be given. The 'such consent not to be unreasonably withheld' requirement is removed, allowing Airspan to arbitrarily deny consent.",

                "original_text": "Distributor agrees to train and have readily available a maintenance\n      staff to efficiently and expeditiously maintain or upgrade all Airspan\n      Products purchased or licensed by Distributor from Airspan.  Maintenance\n      shall be performed in accordance with Airspan's latest maintenance\n      standards for Airspan Products, as provided by Airspan, by Distributor's\n      own personnel and may not be subcontracted or delegated to any other person\n      or entity without Airspan's prior, written authorization.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will try to train a maintenance staff to maintain or upgrade all Airspan Products purchased or licensed by Distributor from Airspan. Maintenance should generally align with Airspan's maintenance standards for Airspan Products, as provided by Airspan, ideally by Distributor's own personnel, subcontracting is permissible with vague informal approval from Airspan.",
                "explanation": "The obligatory 'agrees to train and have readily available' is softened to 'will try to train,' making it non-committal. 'Efficiently and expeditiously' is removed, allowing for slow or inefficient maintenance. The mandatory 'shall be performed in accordance' is weakened to 'should generally align,' making adherence to Airspan's standards optional. 'Prior, written authorization' is replaced with 'vague informal approval,' making it difficult to prove a violation of this clause.",

                "original_text": "Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the\n      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit\n      is impaired,\n",
                "changed_text": "Airspan will consider Distributor's requested delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Airspan is unsure about Distributor's credit,\n",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'use reasonable efforts' is replaced with 'consider,' significantly weakening the obligation and making it subjective. The more objective 'Distributor's credit is impaired' is replaced with the subjective 'Airspan is unsure about Distributor's credit,' granting Airspan broad discretion and potentially leading to arbitrary delays or refusals. This fails to protect the distributor from any legal obligation since the requirements and fulfillment are based on the perspective of Airspan.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Consultant represents as follows: (a) Consultant is not subject to any other agreement that Consultant will violate by signing this Agreement; (b) Consultant has and shall continue to have the knowledge, experience, qualifications and required skill to perform, and shall perform, the Services in a professional manner; (c) Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with all Applicable Law; and (d) During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will not, directly or indirectly (whether for compensation or without compensation) engage in or provide consulting services, or enter into any agreement either written or oral, that would present a material conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or would preclude Consultant from complying with the terms and conditions hereof.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant represents as follows: (a) Consultant will try not to violate any other agreements by signing this Agreement; (b) Consultant is expected to have the knowledge, experience, qualifications and skill to generally perform the Services; (c) Consultant will endeavor to perform the Services in accordance with Applicable Law; and (d) During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will attempt to avoid engaging in any activity that would present a conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by replacing definitive obligations with weaker, less enforceable language. 'Will try not to violate' and 'endeavor to perform' are vague and do not guarantee compliance. 'Expected to have' suggests a lower standard than 'has and shall continue to have.' 'Attempt to avoid' implies that conflicts are permissible as long as an attempt is made to prevent them. This weakens the consultant's commitment and creates uncertainty about their obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires contracts to clearly define obligations to be enforceable. The weakened language makes it difficult to prove a breach of contract due to the vague nature of the consultant's obligations.",

                "original_text": "Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\").",
                "changed_text": "Aduro may be considered the owner of writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\") depending on circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly assigns ownership of all Work Product to Aduro. The modified text introduces ambiguity with 'may be considered' and 'depending on circumstances.' This weakens Aduro's claim to intellectual property developed by the consultant and creates uncertainty about ownership rights. 'Depending on circumstances' is undefined, leaving room for dispute and potentially conflicting with California's laws regarding intellectual property assignment.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires clear and unambiguous language in contracts assigning intellectual property rights. The vague language introduced contradicts this requirement, making it difficult for Aduro to enforce its ownership rights.",

                "original_text": "Consultant shall keep all Confidential Information confidential, and Consultant shall not disclose, disseminate, publish, reproduce or use Confidential Information except to perform the Services. If Consultant is required by judicial or administrative process to disclose Confidential Information, Consultant shall promptly notify Aduro to allow Aduro a reasonable time to oppose such process and Consultant shall reasonably cooperate in Aduro's efforts.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant will generally keep Confidential Information confidential, and Consultant will try not to disclose, disseminate, publish, reproduce or use Confidential Information except when necessary to perform the Services. If Consultant is asked to disclose Confidential Information by judicial or administrative process, Consultant will consider notifying Aduro if feasible.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict obligation to maintain confidentiality. The modified text weakens this obligation by using phrases like 'generally keep,' 'will try not to,' and 'if feasible.' This introduces ambiguity, making it less clear when and how the consultant must protect confidential information. 'If feasible' gives the consultant significant discretion in deciding whether to notify Aduro of a potential disclosure.",
                "contradicted_law": "California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) requires reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of trade secrets. The weakened language suggests a lower standard of care than what is legally required to protect trade secrets.",

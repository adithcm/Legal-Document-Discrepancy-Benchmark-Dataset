Such policy shall provide, in addition to other protection, protection against any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any act, omission, negligence or otherwise giving rise to a third party claim. The amount of coverage shall be a minimum of three million dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit, with no deductible amount for each single occurrence for bodily injury and/or property damage. HERC shall provide for ten (10) days notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination. HERC agrees to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement. In no event shall HERC perform or promote the carry out the activities contemplated under this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement prior to receipt by THC and HSI of evidence of insurance.",
                "changed_text": "HERC shall endeavor, throughout the term of this Agreement, to obtain and maintain, at its own cost and expense, from a reasonably qualified insurance company, liability insurance and business interruption coverage, with advertising injury protection, which should be generally acceptable to THC and HSI, and may name THC and HSI as additional insureds. Such coverage may provide protection against claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of acts, omissions, negligence, or other events. The amount of coverage will be approximately three million dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit. HERC shall provide reasonable notice to THC and HSI in the event of any significant modification, cancellation, or termination, if feasible. HERC will attempt to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing the same. HERC may perform or promote the activities contemplated under this Agreement prior to THC and HSI receiving evidence of insurance.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing mandatory terms like 'shall obtain and maintain' with weaker, discretionary language such as 'shall endeavor to obtain and maintain' and 'may name'. The term 'reasonably qualified' and 'generally acceptable' are vague and subjective. Replacing 'minimum' with 'approximately' and removing the 'no deductible' clause, further weakens the requirements. Changing 'ten (10) days notice' to 'reasonable notice...if feasible' diminishes the notice requirement. The final sentence change also introduces uncertainty about when activities can commence.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring clear and definite obligations. Specifically, the ambiguity undermines the ability of THC and HSI to enforce the insurance requirement effectively, potentially leading to financial risk not clearly mitigated by the contract, in violation of reasonable business practices and potentially exposing them to uncovered liabilities. Applicable state law (Delaware, Florida, New York) principles on contract interpretation would likely find this clause unenforceable due to vagueness.",

HERC shall not take any action that would harm or jeopardize the licensed HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks or HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks. HERC shall assist in such actions to the extent required and requested by HSI for establishing use of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks and HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks during the Interim Period. HSI shall also enforce the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks and HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks during the Interim Period as more fully set forth in the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement. HERC shall be responsible for reimbursing THC and/or HSI for all costs in connection with prosecuting all applications and maintaining in full force and effect all registrations for the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks and HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks during the Interim Period.",
                "changed_text": "During the Interim Period, HSI should consider taking actions to preserve the general validity of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks and the HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks licensed to HERC and HSI may continue to prosecute some applications and maintain some registrations therefor. HERC will try not to take any obviously detrimental action to the licensed HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks or HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks. HERC will provide assistance if conveniently able to do so, as generally requested by HSI, for establishing use of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks and HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks during the Interim Period. HSI may also enforce the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks and HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks during the Interim Period as generally outlined in the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement. HERC will explore options for contributing to the costs associated with prosecuting some applications and maintaining registrations for the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks and HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks during the Interim Period.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear obligation on HSI to preserve and protect the trademarks and requires HERC to reimburse costs. This revision introduces significant ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with weaker terms like 'should consider' and 'may', diminishing the mandatory nature of the actions. The words 'general validity', 'some applications', 'try not', 'obviously detrimental', 'conveniently able', 'generally requested', 'generally outlined', and 'explore options' all weaken the obligations and create loopholes, making enforcement difficult. The original text clearly states HERC will reimburse costs but in the changed text it says HERC will explore options for contributing. This creates a large difference in obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark law requires diligent enforcement and maintenance of trademark rights to prevent genericide or dilution. The weakened language regarding HSI's obligation to 'preserve the general validity' and HERC's limited assistance conflicts with this requirement. This could be interpreted as a failure to adequately protect the trademarks, leading to potential loss of trademark rights. The ambiguous obligations contradict the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 1114) regarding trademark protection.",

However, HSI shall have the sole right to decide whether or not proceedings shall be brought against such third parties. In the event that HSI decides that action should be taken against such third parties, HSI may take such action either in its own name or, alternatively, HSI may authorize HERC to initiate such action in HERC's name. In any event, the Parties agree to cooperate fully with each other to the extent necessary to prosecute such action, all expenses being borne by the Party bringing such action and all damages which may be recovered being solely for the account of that Party.",
                "changed_text": "HERC will endeavor to inform HSI of any mark used by a third party if HERC subjectively believes there might possibly be an infringement or passing off of some HERTZ or HERTZ-formative intellectual property utilized by or licensed to HERC according to the terms of this agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement. Nevertheless, HSI can decide whether or not proceedings will be brought against such third parties. If HSI decides that some action should maybe be taken against such third parties, HSI might take action in its own name or, HSI may perhaps authorize HERC to start action in HERC's name. Anyway, the Parties will attempt to cooperate if reasonably convenient, with expenses possibly being borne by the Party starting the action and damages that may be recovered potentially being for the account of that Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that HERC 'shall promptly notify HSI' and the parties 'agree to cooperate fully'. The revised text weakens these obligations significantly. The phrases 'will endeavor to inform', 'subjectively believes', 'might possibly be', 'some', 'can decide', 'some action should maybe be taken', 'might take', 'may perhaps authorize', 'will attempt to cooperate if reasonably convenient', 'expenses possibly being borne', and 'damages...potentially being' all introduce subjectivity and ambiguity, making enforcement highly problematic. This creates ambiguity in the legal requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark law places an obligation on trademark owners and licensees to actively monitor and prevent infringement to protect their brand. The weakened notification and cooperation clauses could be construed as a failure to adequately protect the HERTZ trademarks, potentially weakening their enforceability against infringers. This contradicts the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 1114) regarding trademark infringement and the duty to protect trademark rights.",

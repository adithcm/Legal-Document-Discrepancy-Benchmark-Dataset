The Sponsor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on written  notice to Racing if any driver, the general manager or any other member of Racing (i) fails to conduct himself/herself in accordance with generally  accepted standards of morality, (ii) engages in any activity which reflects adversely on the image, reputation or goodwill of the Sponsor or (iii)  disparages the products or services of the Sponsor; provided, however, the Sponsor shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement if Racing,  within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice by the Sponsor terminates the employment of, or otherwise dismisses from the racing team,  the driver(s), general manager(s) or other member(s) of Racing engaging in the offensive conduct. Upon termination, the Sponsor shall be entitled  to a pro rata refund of monies paid for services not yet performed by Racing based upon the number of races for the applicable racing season. The  Sponsor's decision with respect to all matters arising under this Section shall be conclusive.",
                "changed_text": "Racing and all Racing members, including but not limited to all drivers, should endeavor to conduct themselves in a manner that does not unduly reflect unfavorably upon the Sponsor or its products. The Sponsor may have the right to terminate this Agreement on written notice to Racing if any driver, the general manager or any other member of Racing (i) arguably fails to conduct himself/herself in accordance with standards of morality, (ii) participates in any activity which might reflect adversely on the image, reputation or goodwill of the Sponsor or (iii) expresses opinions about the products or services of the Sponsor; provided, however, the Sponsor shall likely not have the right to terminate this Agreement if Racing attempts, within a reasonable timeframe after receipt of written notice by the Sponsor, to address the behavior of the driver(s), general manager(s) or other member(s) of Racing engaging in the questionable conduct. Upon termination, the Sponsor may be entitled to a refund. The Sponsor's perspective with respect to matters arising under this Section shall be considered.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'agree to use best efforts' with 'should endeavor,' making the standard of conduct less stringent. The terms 'unduly,' 'arguably fails,' 'might reflect,' 'expresses opinions,' 'likely not have the right', 'attempts', 'reasonable timeframe,' and 'questionable conduct' introduce ambiguity. Replacing 'shall be entitled to' with 'may be entitled' and 'decision shall be conclusive' with 'perspective shall be considered' create uncertainty around the remedies and decision-making power of the Sponsor. This contradicts basic principles of contract law which emphasizes on the certainty of terms and enforceability of obligations. These ambiguously worded clauses weakens Sponsor's rights.",

Racing shall also provide comprehensive (fire and theft) and collision  insurance on each vehicle used in the Business. Racing shall provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing \"Gainsco Inc. and all  related entities\" as additional insureds, stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available the  Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Sponsor of cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.",
                "changed_text": "Racing shall attempt to obtain and maintain, at Racing's expense, automobile liability insurance covering vehicles used by Racing in the Business with suggested limits of $5,000,000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage, including typical statutory coverage. Racing will endeavor to provide comprehensive (fire and theft) and collision insurance on some vehicles used in the Business. Racing shall attempt to provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing \"Gainsco Inc. and all related entities\" as additional insureds, stating that such insurance may be primary in coverage, and providing approximately thirty (30) days' notice to the Sponsor of potential cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall obtain and maintain\" with \"shall attempt to obtain and maintain\" and \"suggested limits\" introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation to secure adequate insurance. The phrasing \"typical statutory coverage\" and \"endeavor to provide comprehensive insurance on some vehicles\" weaken the insurance requirements. Replacing \"shall provide\" with \"shall attempt to provide\", \"may be primary in coverage\" and \"approximately thirty days' notice\" further erodes the Sponsor's protection by creating uncertainty about the scope of insurance and notice requirements. These ambiguous alterations may not meet the insurance standards usually required for businesses in Texas, and could lead to violations if the insurance coverage is insufficient.",

                "explanation": "The use of qualifiers like \"arguably\", \"may consider\", \"deemed suitable\", and \"perhaps\" significantly weakens the remedies available to a party in case of a breach. It transforms the right to seek remedies into a discretionary option, which contradicts the principle of providing effective remedies for contract breaches. The added ambiguity makes it difficult for a court to determine what constitutes a breach and what remedies are appropriate, undermining the enforceability of the contract.",

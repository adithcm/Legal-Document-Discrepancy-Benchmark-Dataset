                "original_text": "Constellation will provide, or cause to be provided, all of the Services included in the Products & Services in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, codes, orders, treaties and other requirements of federal/national, state/provincial and local governments and agencies thereof, including but not limited those relating to labor, health, safety and the environment.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates compliance with all applicable laws. The modified text replaces 'in compliance' with 'making commercially reasonable efforts to comply', which is vague and subjective. This weakens the obligation and allows Constellation to argue that it only needs to make a reasonable, commercially driven effort, rather than fully complying with the law. The word endeavor weakens the legal obligation as well.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and state laws, including OSHA regulations (29 U.S.C. ยง 654) regarding workplace safety, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regarding labor standards, and environmental regulations enforced by the EPA, all of which require strict compliance, not just 'reasonable efforts'.",

                "original_text": "Constellation shall, at its own expense, secure and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term (a) insurance coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person's right of publicity and right of privacy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] per occurrence; and (b) a general liability insurance policy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] in aggregate. The liability limits may be met with any combination of primary and excess or umbrella insurance policy limits. Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance, naming each HOF Entity as an additional insured, evidencing the existence of such insurance policies within ten (10) days after execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Constellation should, at its own expense, attempt to secure and maintain insurance coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person's right of publicity and right of privacy. Constellation should attempt to maintain a general liability insurance policy. Constellation may provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance, but providing the certificates shall not be a condition of the enforceability of the contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a strict obligation for Constellation to secure and maintain insurance. The modified text weakens this by replacing 'shall' with 'should attempt to'. Removing the A.M. Best rating requirement also reduces the stringency. Furthermore, stating that providing certificates is not a condition of enforceability removes the clear verification mechanism, making it difficult to prove non-compliance. The original requirement to name each HOF Entity as an additional insured is completely removed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard contract law principles require clear and unambiguous obligations, particularly concerning insurance coverage. Vague language like 'attempt to' and removing specific requirements create an unenforceable obligation and increases liability for Hall of Fame Village in the event of a claim.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires strict compliance and obtaining necessary approvals. By changing 'shall comply' to 'make good faith efforts to comply' and 'shall obtain' to 'will seek to obtain...where practical', the obligation is weakened. 'Good faith efforts' is subjective and 'where practical' allows the licensee to avoid compliance if they deem it impractical. This undermines the original intention of ensuring legal compliance in the use of intellectual property.",

This includes obtaining necessary permits and licenses. This is especially true when dealing with endorsements or promotions, which often involve legal disclosures or regulatory compliance.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'will set up and utilize' to 'may set up' and 'shall be similar to the portal that FMI provides' to 'could be similar to the portals that FMI provides' introduces ambiguity about whether FMI is actually required to create a web portal and if it does what level of web portal needs to be created. This creates uncertainty about the access Roche will have to sample results and patient reports. \n",

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the 'Most Favored Customer' clause by replacing 'agrees that the pricing terms ... are, and will be, at least as favorable as' with 'intends that the pricing terms ... will generally be similar to'. The original language created a clear legal obligation for FMI to provide Roche with the best pricing available. The modified language is subjective and provides no clear mechanism for enforcement. This creates uncertainty about whether Roche will receive competitive pricing. This is an ambiguous change, weakening the clear legal obligation.",

                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens FMI's obligation to handle regulatory filings. Replacing 'shall be responsible for pursuing, compiling and submitting all' with 'might assist with' and 'possibly interact with' makes FMI's role discretionary. This vague language creates uncertainty about who is ultimately responsible for ensuring regulatory compliance and could lead to delays or non-compliance, contradicting regulatory requirements for medical devices and diagnostics in the US and other territories.",

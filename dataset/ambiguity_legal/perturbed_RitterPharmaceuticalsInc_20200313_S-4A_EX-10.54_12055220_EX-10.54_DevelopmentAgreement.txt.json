                "original_text": "Qualigen shall use reasonable efforts to assure that the Products, as manufactured by Qualigen, conform to the applicable product specifications and requirements of the Regulatory Authorities in, and are manufactured in accordance with all Regulatory Approvals, laws and regulations applicable to the Products in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen shall maintain the necessary records to comply with all Regulatory Approvals and other applicable rules and regulations in the Applicable Markets.",
                "changed_text": "Qualigen will attempt to use reasonable efforts to assure that the Products, as manufactured by Qualigen, generally conform to what it believes are the applicable product specifications and requirements of Regulatory Authorities. Qualigen may maintain records related to Regulatory Approvals and applicable rules.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall use reasonable efforts to assure' to 'will attempt to use reasonable efforts to assure,' the obligation to ensure product conformity is weakened, making it less enforceable. Furthermore, the change from 'conform to the applicable product specifications' to 'generally conform to what it believes are the applicable product specifications' introduces subjectivity and undermines the guarantee of adherence to regulatory requirements. The final sentence changes the mandatory 'shall maintain the necessary records' to the discretionary 'may maintain records related to Regulatory Approvals,' further weakening Qualigen's obligation to maintain regulatory compliance records. This introduces ambiguity around the level of compliance required, potentially conflicting with FDA regulations (21 CFR Part 820) and similar international standards that mandate strict adherence to manufacturing standards and record-keeping.",

                "original_text": "Qualigen shall receive, investigate in a timely manner, and as appropriate, resolve customer complaints in the Territory. If an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen shall perform the investigation and shall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen shall ship a replacement Product to the customer.",
                "changed_text": "Qualigen will endeavor to receive, investigate, and possibly resolve customer complaints in the Territory. If Qualigen deems an investigation necessary, it may perform an investigation, the scope of which will be determined at its discretion. Qualigen might ship a replacement Product to the customer.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates Qualigen to receive, investigate, and resolve customer complaints, but the modified text makes these actions discretionary by using 'will endeavor to,' 'possibly resolve,' and 'Qualigen deems an investigation necessary.' By replacing 'shall perform the investigation' with 'it may perform an investigation, the scope of which will be determined at its discretion,' Qualigen's obligation to conduct thorough investigations is weakened. Finally, changing 'shall ship a replacement Product' to 'might ship a replacement Product' makes providing replacements optional. This ambiguity conflicts with regulations related to handling complaints (e.g., ISO 13485, 21 CFR Part 820), which require manufacturers to have a robust and well-documented complaint handling process.",

Otherwise, Sekisui shall return the recalled units of Product to Qualigen in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions after completion of the action. ",

Sekisui might return the recalled units of Product to Qualigen.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall destroy' to 'should consider destroying' makes the destruction of recalled products conditional, not mandatory. The phrase 'based on Qualigen's (or any governmental authority's) suggestion' weakens the requirement to follow written instructions, as does the use of 'preferably following Qualigen's general guidance' rather than 'in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions'. Finally, changing 'Sekisui shall return' to 'Sekisui might return' makes the return of recalled products optional. This weakened obligation is ambiguous and potentially violates recall regulations (e.g., 21 CFR Part 7), which require specific procedures for handling recalled products to ensure public safety.",

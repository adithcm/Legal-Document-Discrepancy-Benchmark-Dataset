                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "As of the Effective Date, ICC on its behalf and on behalf of ICAS has, and during the term of this  Agreement shall use reasonable efforts to maintain, all material licenses, permits, registrations, authorizations, orders, consents,  and other approvals by each Government Entity necessary or advisable for the performance of its obligations under the  Transaction Documents to which it is a party.",
                "changed_text": "As of the Effective Date, ICC on its behalf and on behalf of ICAS, may attempt to obtain and maintain licenses, permits, registrations, authorizations, orders, consents, and other approvals by each Government Entity necessary or advisable for the performance of its obligations under the  Transaction Documents to which it is a party, as they see fit.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use reasonable efforts to maintain' to 'may attempt to obtain and maintain... as they see fit' introduces ambiguity and discretion. It is no longer a clear obligation to maintain all necessary licenses and approvals, which is a violation of regulatory requirements. The phrase 'as they see fit' introduces a subjective element, undermining the obligation.",

                "changed_text": "Each of the PHL Parties may endeavor to maintain, and encourage each of the directors, officers, employees, agents  and representatives of each of the PHL Parties or any Affiliate thereof to maintain some registrations, licenses,  memberships, approvals, and consents possibly necessary to carry out some of their obligations under the Transaction Documents as needed.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall maintain' to 'may endeavor to maintain' weakens the obligation. Using 'some registrations, licenses... possibly necessary' creates ambiguity about which registrations and obligations are truly required, violating regulations requiring specific and comprehensive licensing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal regulations requiring specific licenses and registrations for insurance companies and related personnel (e.g., state insurance licenses, SEC registrations).",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall perform... in compliance' to 'should consider performing... in general alignment' makes compliance with applicable law discretionary and vague. 'General alignment' is ambiguous and does not guarantee compliance, which violates legal requirements.",

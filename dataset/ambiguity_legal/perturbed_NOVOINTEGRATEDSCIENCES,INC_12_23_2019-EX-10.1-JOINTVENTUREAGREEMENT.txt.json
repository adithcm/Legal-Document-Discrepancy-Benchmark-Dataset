                "changed_text": "To maintain financial records of the Company and provide reporting to Company stakeholders when deemed necessary. Records may be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"all financial records\" to just \"financial records\" and making the reporting schedule discretionary ('when deemed necessary') and the accounting standards vague ('generally accepted accounting principles'), the obligation becomes ambiguous and unenforceable. Removing 'quarterly' and 'annual' removes mandatory timeline that is required, replacing US GAAP with 'generally accepted accounting principles' also allows for manipulation of reporting.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"ensure timely remittance\" to \"attempt to remit…in a reasonable timeframe\" and \"ensure specific adherence\" to \"consider tax implications\" introduces significant ambiguity. \"Reasonable timeframe\" is not defined, and merely 'considering' tax implications doesn't guarantee compliance. Similarly, changing \"ensure maximum tax reduction…elimination\" to \"explore potential tax reductions…possibilities of tax elimination\" weakens the obligation. Tax laws require strict and timely remittance, and this change makes compliance discretionary and unclear.",

They will operate the business to avoid significantly damaging the reputation of NVOS and HGF through the Company.",
                "explanation": "Weakening the \"best efforts\" standard to a \"reasonable extent,\" replacing \"faithfully, honestly, and diligently perform\" with \"in a generally acceptable manner,\" and replacing \"continuously exert best efforts to promote and enhance\" with \"strive to promote the business when feasible\" all introduce ambiguity and make the obligations far less stringent. Changing \"preserve, maintain and enhance the reputation\" to \"avoid significantly damaging the reputation\" lowers the bar significantly. These changes make enforcement difficult and contradict the initial intent of a strong collaborative effort. 'Reasonable extent', 'Generally acceptable manner', and 'when feasible' are also highly subjective.",

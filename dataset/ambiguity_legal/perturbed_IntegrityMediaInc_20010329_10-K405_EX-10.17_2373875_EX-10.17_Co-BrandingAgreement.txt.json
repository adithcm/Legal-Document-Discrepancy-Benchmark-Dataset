                "original_text": "Integrity will obtain master lease and print agreements with all third party owners of masters embodied in the Product at its own expense. Mechanical rates will not exceed [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the then-current statutory rate, and Print licenses will not exceed a prorated portion of [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the retail selling price, Integrity will also manufacture the Product and sell to TL its requirements for resale.",
                "changed_text": "Integrity will endeavor to obtain master lease and print agreements with third party owners of masters embodied in the Product. Mechanical rates should generally align with the then-current statutory rate, and print licenses should align with the retail selling price, though deviations are permissible. Integrity will manufacture the Product and aim to fulfill TL's requirements for resale.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will obtain' with 'will endeavor' weakens the obligation to secure necessary agreements. 'Should generally align' and 'should align' introduces ambiguity about the mechanical and print license rates. 'Aim to fulfill' introduces uncertainty about meeting TL's requirements. This contradicts standard copyright law which necessitates obtaining clear licenses and agreed-upon royalty rates.",

                "changed_text": "All such artwork will be subject to Integrity's approval. Integrity will endeavor to respond to any request for approval.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'reasonable' before approval, the artwork is subject to arbitrary approval. By replacing the specified timeline of “five (5) business days after Integrity’s receipt of request and samples” with “endeavor to respond to any request for approval” the contract opens the door to Integrity never responding. This may be a violation of good faith.",

TL specifically agrees to supply Integrity with data on former subscribers to its \"Songs 4 Life\" series, who have subsequently canceled for the express purpose of soliciting Product continuity subscriptions.",
                "changed_text": "The parties may consider sharing mailing list data of purchasers of the products created hereunder, potentially in exchange for names of perceived equal value. TL may consider supplying Integrity with data on former subscribers to its \"Songs 4 Life\" series.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'agree that they will' with 'may consider', the obligation to share mailing list data becomes optional and vague. Also, Replacing 'in exchange for names of equal value' with 'potentially in exchange for names of perceived equal value' introduces subjectivity, and the word 'perceived' can lead to conflict on what defines perceived value. By replacing “TL specifically agrees” to provide mailing list data from its former subscribers with “TL may consider supplying” the exchange is no longer mandatory. This creates ambiguity and contradicts the intent to leverage existing customer bases.",

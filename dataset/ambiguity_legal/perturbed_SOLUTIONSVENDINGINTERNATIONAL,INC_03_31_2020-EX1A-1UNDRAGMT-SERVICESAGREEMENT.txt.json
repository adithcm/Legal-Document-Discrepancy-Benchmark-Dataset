                "original_text": "Amounts which remain unpaid for 30 days are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of Service.",
                "changed_text": "Amounts which remain unpaid for a period may be subject to a finance charge, potentially up to 1.5% per month, depending on circumstances. Collection expenses might be added, and service termination could be considered.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the finance charge and consequences of non-payment. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'a period,' 'potentially up to,' 'depending on circumstances,' and 'could be considered.' This weakens the obligation and creates uncertainty about the actual penalties for late payments.",
                "contradicted_law": "Usury laws in various states (e.g., California, New York) which set clear limits on interest rates and late fees that can be charged. The ambiguity makes it unclear if the contract complies with these specific state laws.",

                "changed_text": "Customer generally represents to the Company that this Service Agreement will likely constitute an obligation of Customer, possibly enforceable.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a strong warranty that the agreement is binding. The modified text weakens this statement significantly by using words like 'generally,' 'likely,' and 'possibly,' making the enforceability of the contract uncertain. This creates ambiguity around the customer's commitment to the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic contract law principles require clear and unambiguous terms for a contract to be valid and enforceable. This change casts doubt on whether the agreement meets that standard, potentially making it unenforceable in court.",

                "changed_text": "The Company may consider who is at fault and potentially liable for the Reversed Payment and Reversal Fee",
                "explanation": "The original text states the company has sole discretion. The modified text changes that to 'may consider' and 'potentially liable' making it harder to determine who is at fault and liable.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq.) and Regulation E outline consumer protections related to electronic fund transfers, including liability for unauthorized transfers. Making the determination of fault and liability discretionary contradicts these regulations which set clear guidelines for resolving disputes.",

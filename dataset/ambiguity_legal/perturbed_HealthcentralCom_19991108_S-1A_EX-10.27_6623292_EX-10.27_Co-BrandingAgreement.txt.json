                "changed_text": "ensure that in the event that it enters into an electronic commerce agreement with a third party for the sale of goods on the Co-Branded Site that all agreements with the third parties should endeavor to ensure that such third party is responsible for products and transactions. Such transactions should, to the best of their ability, comply with Canadian and US laws and regulations, including privacy laws and MediaLinx's standards and guidelines. Furthermore, they should attempt to provide an indemnity to MediaLinx and HCI in respect of any and all transactions and products that may be hosted on the Co-Branded Site",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall ensure' and 'shall comply' with weaker phrases like 'should endeavor to ensure,' 'to the best of their ability,' and 'should attempt to provide.' This introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation less stringent. This contradicts the intent of privacy laws like **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** and the Canadian equivalent **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**, which require businesses to ensure compliance, not just make an attempt.",

                "explanation": "The changes replace the objective 'reasonable commercial efforts' with the subjective 'what it deems to be reasonable efforts' and 'a standard it finds suitable,' giving HCI sole discretion. Replacing 'ensure' with 'attempt to keep' further weakens the obligation to maintain site availability. This could violate implicit obligations to provide reasonable service in a contract setting, which would be enforceable under contract laws across the United States and Canada. Using phrases such as 'What it deems to be reasonable efforts' and 'a standard it finds suitable' is too vauge.",

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall be collected and used in accordance with' with 'will be collected and used in a manner that considers.' This implies that full compliance is not required, potentially violating the privacy laws mentioned above. Also, replacing 'shall each own an undivided interest' with 'may own an interest' makes ownership discretionary. Privacy laws, such as GDPR and CCPA, have strict rules regarding data usage and collection.",

                "original_text": "The Professional agrees to use only the golf clubs and golf bags of the Company in any golf event, whether professional or social, during the Term. The Professional agrees (i) to use no golf bag bearing any identification of a competitor of the Company and (ii) to wear no apparel bearing any identification of a competitor of the Company, and will prohibit any caddy of hers from bearing any such identification.",
                "changed_text": "The Professional will endeavor to use the golf clubs and golf bags of the Company in most golf events, whether professional or social, during the Term. The Professional will make an effort to avoid using a golf bag bearing clear identification of a direct competitor of the Company and try to ensure her caddy does the same.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a strict requirement for the Professional to use only the Company's products. The modified version uses ambiguous language like 'endeavor,' 'most,' and 'try to ensure,' weakening the obligation and making it subjective. This introduces uncertainty as to whether the Professional is fully committed to exclusively using the Company's equipment, which is essential for endorsement contracts. The use of 'clear identification' is also vague. This undermines the exclusivity agreement by introducing ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "The Professional shall at all times during the Term refrain from:\n\n5.1.1 dishonest, fraudulent, illegal or unethical acts or omissions;\n\n5.1.2 excessive use or abuse of alcohol;\n\n5.1.3 use of controlled substances, except as prescribed by a licensed medical professional in the treatment of illness or disease;\n\n5.1.4 acts or omissions reasonably determined by the Company to be prejudicial or injurious to the business or goodwill of the Company, its officers, employees, shareholders or products, the golf industry or professional golf; and\n\n5.1.5 conduct which could reasonably be expected to degrade the Professional, devalue the services of the Professional or to bring the Professional into public hatred, contempt, scorn or ridicule, or that could reasonably be expected to shock, insult or offend the community or to offend public morals or decency.",
                "changed_text": "The Professional should generally refrain from:\n\n5.1.1 acts or omissions that are allegedly dishonest or unethical;\n\n5.1.2 what could be considered excessive alcohol use;\n\n5.1.3 use of controlled substances if not clearly prescribed by a medical professional;\n\n5.1.4 acts or omissions that the Company perceives as potentially prejudicial or injurious to its goodwill; and\n\n5.1.5 conduct that might possibly degrade the Professional or offend certain community standards.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides clear and specific prohibitions. The modified version introduces ambiguity with phrases like 'generally refrain,' 'allegedly dishonest,' 'what could be considered,' 'if not clearly prescribed,' 'perceives as potentially prejudicial,' and 'might possibly.' This makes the restrictions subjective and difficult to enforce, as the interpretation of what constitutes a violation is open to dispute. The original 'dishonest, fraudulent, illegal acts' have been reduced to 'acts or omissions that are allegedly dishonest or unethical.' This weakens the obligations, creating uncertainty and contradicting the intended clear standards of professional conduct.",

                "changed_text": "The Company may, at its convenience, request the Professional to provide what she believes are relevant insurance documents.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'may require' to 'may, at its convenience, request', the obligation on the Professional to provide insurance certificates is significantly weakened. Furthermore, adding 'what she believes are relevant insurance documents' introduces subjectivity, allowing the Professional to decide what documents are provided. This undermines the Company's ability to ensure proper insurance coverage and creates ambiguity.",

Customer agrees that aspects of the Software and associated Documentation, including the specific design and structure of individual programs, are trade secrets and/or copyrighted materials of Cisco, its suppliers or licensors. Customer shall endeavor not to disclose, provide, or otherwise make available such trade secrets or copyrighted material in any form to any third party without the prior written consent of Cisco.

Title to Software and Documentation shall remain solely with Cisco, its suppliers or licensors.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees' to 'shall endeavor' makes the obligation to protect trade secrets less binding. Replacing 'shall implement reasonable security measures' with 'shall consider implementing security measures' introduces ambiguity and makes the security measures discretionary. This weakens the protection of Cisco's intellectual property.",

Customer grants to Cisco and its independent accountants the right to examine Customer's books, records and accounts during Customer's normal business hours to verify compliance with this Agreement.

Customer may allow Cisco and its independent accountants to request examination of Customer's books, records and accounts during what Customer considers normal business hours to potentially verify compliance with this Agreement. In the event such a review suggests possible non-compliance with this Agreement, Customer will consider paying Cisco the suggested license fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text created a definitive obligation, while the changed text makes the Customer's actions entirely discretionary. Terms like 'may allow', 'request examination', 'what Customer considers normal business hours', 'potentially verify compliance' and 'consider paying' significantly weaken Cisco's ability to audit for compliance and receive appropriate fees, creating an ambiguous and unenforceable situation.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'may be subject' to 'might be subject' introduces uncertainty about whether export control laws apply. Replacing 'agrees to comply strictly' with 'should attempt to generally comply' weakens the obligation to comply with export regulations. Changing 'has the responsibility to obtain licenses' to 'may have some responsibility to seek licenses' makes the responsibility for obtaining export licenses unclear, potentially leading to violations of export control laws.",

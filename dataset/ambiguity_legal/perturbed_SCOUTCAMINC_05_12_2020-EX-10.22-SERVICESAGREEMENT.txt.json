                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Maimon agrees during the term of this Agreement not to accept work or enter into a contract or accept an obligation inconsistent or incompatible with Maimon's obligations under this Agreement or with the scope of services to be rendered for the Company. Maimon warrants that to the best of Maimon's knowledge, there is no other contract or duty on Maimon's part now in existence inconsistent with this Agreement. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after expiration or termination for any reason of this Agreement, Maimon agrees not to: (a) compete with the business of the Company, whether individually or through any entity, or to use (or permit the use of) any Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of competing with the business of the Company; or (b) suggest to, induce or persuade any customer, client, vendor, supplier, employee, consultant or agent of the Company to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Maimon agrees during the term of this Agreement to potentially accept other work, provided it does not significantly interfere with his obligations under this Agreement as he understands them. Maimon warrants that to the best of Maimon's current recollection, there is no directly conflicting contract or duty on Maimon's part now in existence. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of perhaps two (2) years after expiration or termination for any reason of this Agreement, Maimon agrees not to: (a) actively seek to compete with the primary business model of the Company; or (b) make overt attempts to directly solicit any key client, vendor, or employee specifically named by the Company in writing.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces significant ambiguity by using vague terms like 'potentially,' 'does not significantly interfere,' 'as he understands them,' 'current recollection,' 'perhaps two years,' 'actively seek to compete with the primary business model,' and 'overt attempts to directly solicit.' This weakens the non-compete and non-solicitation clauses, making them difficult to enforce. The original clause intended to prevent Maimon from engaging in any conflicting work and strictly prohibited competition and solicitation. The revised text offers loopholes and subjective interpretations, undermining the protective intent of the clauses.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law regarding non-compete agreements requires them to be reasonable in scope, duration, and geographic area to protect legitimate business interests. The introduced ambiguities could render the non-compete clause unreasonable and unenforceable under New York law, particularly with the weakened definitions of competition and solicitation and the uncertainty regarding the duration of the restriction.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Company will reimburse Maimon for all reasonable pre- approved out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will endeavor to reimburse Maimon for expenses he feels are related to this Agreement, pending budgetary review.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"will reimburse\" with \"will endeavor to reimburse\" weakens the obligation, making reimbursement discretionary. The addition of \"expenses he feels are related to this Agreement\" introduces subjectivity, and \"pending budgetary review\" adds another layer of uncertainty, allowing the Company to potentially deny reimbursement based on its own discretion. This creates ambiguity about what expenses are actually reimbursable and under what conditions.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could violate implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under New York contract law, which requires parties to act honestly in carrying out their contractual duties. The ambiguous language gives the Company excessive discretion to deny legitimate expenses, potentially breaching this covenant.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Maimon recognizes and acknowledges that by reason of his retention by and service to the Company, Maimon will have access to certain confidential and proprietary information relating to the Company's business, which may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, trade \"know-how,\" product development techniques and plans, formulas, customer lists and addresses, financing services, funding programs, cost and pricing information, marketing and sales techniques, strategy and programs, computer programs and software and financial information (collectively referred to as \"Confidential Information\"). Maimon acknowledges that such Confidential Information is a valuable and unique asset of the Company and covenants that he will not, unless expressly authorized in writing by the Company, at any time use any Confidential Information or divulge or disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm or corporation except in connection with the performance of his duties for the Company and in a manner consistent with the Company's policies regarding Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "Maimon acknowledges he *may* encounter information *considered* confidential by the Company. Maimon agrees to make a *good faith effort* not to disclose information he *clearly* recognizes as trade secrets or directly proprietary information, unless required for his duties *as he understands them* or unless generally known publicly.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a strong obligation to protect Confidential Information. The changes weaken this significantly: 'may encounter' reduces certainty of access; 'considered' introduces subjectivity; 'good faith effort' reduces obligation to a mere attempt; 'clearly recognizes' introduces a subjective test for what constitutes a trade secret; 'as he understands them' allows Maimon to interpret his duties loosely; and 'generally known publicly' is vague and broad.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change conflicts with New York's trade secret laws, which require reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality. By weakening the obligation and introducing subjectivity, the modified clause may not provide sufficient protection to the Company's trade secrets, potentially rendering them unenforceable.",

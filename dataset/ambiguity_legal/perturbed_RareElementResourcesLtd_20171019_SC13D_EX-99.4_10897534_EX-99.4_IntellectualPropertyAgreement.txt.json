Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Company elects to abandon any patent application, to not pay maintenance fees or annuities to keep a patent in force, or to otherwise take or fail to take any action that will result in a loss of patent rights, Company shall give Investor at least sixty (60) days prior written notice and an opportunity to take over the prosecution of the patent application that would be abandoned and/or pay the fees necessary to keep the patent in force and/or take any other action necessary to avoid the loss of patent rights. In the event that Investor takes over the prosecution of a patent application or maintenance of a patent under this Article 4.00, Company shall retain ownership of the patent application or patent, and the patent shall remain subject to this IP Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Company may have the right to file, prosecute, and maintain Patents covering the inventions that are the property of Company and can determine if, and where, to file a patent application, to abandon the prosecution of any patent or patent application, or to discontinue the maintenance of any patent or patent application. If Company considers abandoning any patent application, not paying maintenance fees or annuities to keep a patent in force, or taking any action that might result in a potential loss of patent rights, Company will endeavor to give Investor notice and an opportunity to potentially take over the prosecution of the patent application that would be abandoned and/or pay the fees to keep the patent in force and/or take action to potentially avoid the loss of patent rights. If Investor takes over the prosecution of a patent application or maintenance of a patent under this Article 4.00, Company will retain ownership and the patent remains subject to this IP Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Company's obligations regarding patent prosecution and notice to Investor. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'may have the right,' 'can determine if,' 'considers abandoning,' 'endeavor to give,' and 'potentially take over' to weaken the obligations. This makes it unclear under what circumstances Company is actually required to notify the Investor or maintain the patents, rendering the legal obligation ambiguous and subjective. This could lead to disputes over whether Company adequately fulfilled its obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Patent law requires clear procedures for patent maintenance and abandonment. This ambiguity may cause a breach of fiduciary duty or contract law if the company abandons patents without proper notification or justification, causing financial harm to the investor. Also, the Lanham Act dictates requirements for avoiding consumer confusion around brands, which could occur if patent protection is not properly maintained.",

                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on the Company to indemnify the Investor. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall indemnify' with 'shall endeavor to indemnify,' making the indemnification discretionary. It also adds 'subject to applicable law,' without further clarifying the conditions, and 'if deemed appropriate', further obscuring the obligation. This change weakens the obligation to indemnify, making it difficult for the Investor to enforce their right to indemnification.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires specific performance of indemnification clauses. The ambiguity in this modification may violate the principle of good faith and fair dealing, a core concept in contract law. It may also conflict with state laws that determine how indemnification clauses are enforced.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the Company 'will not grant' rights to third parties beyond the option period. The modified text replaces 'will not grant' with 'will attempt not to grant', which weakens the legal obligation from a strict prohibition to a discretionary effort. Adding 'might extend' introduces further vagueness regarding the scope of the prohibition. This creates uncertainty about the Company's commitment and allows room for interpretation, potentially leading to actions that undermine the Investor's rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change introduces ambiguity into the contract that could make it unenforceable or give rise to litigation based on breach of contract claims. The weaker obligation may not adequately protect the investor's intellectual property rights as initially intended. The Statute of Frauds requires contracts involving intellectual property to be clearly defined.",

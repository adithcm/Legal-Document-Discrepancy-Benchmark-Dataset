                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Guarantors shall unconditionally guarantee full performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of all the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement at the times and in the manner therein provided.",
                "changed_text": "Guarantors shall endeavor to guarantee performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of the obligations under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall unconditionally guarantee full performance' to 'shall endeavor to guarantee performance', the obligation becomes ambiguous and less stringent. 'Endeavor' implies an effort rather than a guaranteed outcome, which weakens the legal commitment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - creates uncertainty regarding the enforceability of the guarantee, potentially violating principles requiring clear and definite terms in contracts.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall pay' with 'shall attempt to pay' introduces ambiguity about the Guarantors' responsibility for payment. It suggests they will only try to pay, not that they are obligated to ensure payment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - undermines the certainty of payment obligations, potentially conflicting with basic principles of contract enforcement.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Guarantors shall indemnify and save harmless Franchisor and its affiliates against and from all losses, damages, costs, and expenses which Franchisor and its affiliates may sustain, incur, or become liable for by reason of: (1) the failure for any reason whatsoever of Master Franchisee to pay the monies payable pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement or to do and perform any other act, matter or thing pursuant to the provisions of the Master Franchise Agreement; or (2) any act, action, or proceeding of or by Franchisor for or in connection with the recovery of monies or the obtaining of performance by Master Franchisee of any other act, matter or thing pursuant to the provisions of the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Guarantors may indemnify Franchisor and its affiliates from losses, damages, costs, and expenses which Franchisor and its affiliates may sustain, incur, or become liable for due to: (1) the Master Franchisee's failure to pay monies under the Master Franchise Agreement; or (2) any act by Franchisor related to recovering monies or performance by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall indemnify and save harmless' to 'may indemnify' makes the indemnification discretionary rather than mandatory. Removing 'all' before losses, damages etc. also reduces the scope of responsibility. This significantly weakens the protection afforded to the Franchisor.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - diminishes the protection of the indemnitee in case of a breach. Indemnification provisions are typically enforced by courts.",

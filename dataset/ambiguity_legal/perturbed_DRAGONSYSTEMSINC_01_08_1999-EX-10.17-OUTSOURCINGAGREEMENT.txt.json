                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "MMI shall deliver the Services in line with the agreed service levels to Dragon Systems.",
                "changed_text": "MMI shall endeavor to deliver the Services in general alignment with service levels to Dragon Systems.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates MMI to deliver services according to agreed service levels. The modified text replaces 'shall deliver' with 'shall endeavor to deliver' and 'in line with agreed service levels' with 'in general alignment with service levels.' This creates ambiguity, making the obligation less strict and difficult to enforce. 'Endeavor' suggests an attempt rather than a guarantee, and 'general alignment' is vague. This introduces a legal contradiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Creates uncertainty regarding the enforceability of service level agreements, potentially violating the principle of 'good faith and fair dealing' implied in contracts under Netherlands law (since MMI is based there) regarding reasonable standards of performance.",

                "original_text": "MMI warrants providing the Services with due diligence and care in accordance\n\n\n\nwith the specifications set by Dragon Systems. Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 6 months from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims.",
                "changed_text": "MMI believes it provides the Services with appropriate diligence and care. Should MMI encounter difficulties supplying the Services, or should problems arise, Dragon Systems may consider discussing possible solutions with MMI.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear warranty regarding the provision of services. The modified text weakens this warranty significantly by replacing 'warrants providing' with 'believes it provides,' which is subjective and does not guarantee any specific level of performance. It replaces concrete remedies for non-compliance ('require MMI to complete or re-perform') with a vague invitation to discuss possible solutions. This severely weakens MMI's obligation and makes it difficult for Dragon Systems to enforce the warranty.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Warranty provisions are weakened, making enforcement difficult and potentially violating principles of reasonable performance standards under Massachusetts law (governing law is in Massachusetts).",

                "original_text": "MMI shall at its own expense obtain and maintain with an insurer adequate insurance coverage in respect of any Dragon Systems property under the care, custody or control of MMI. MMI shall immediately notify Dragon Systems in writing of any theft, loss or damage to any Dragon Systems property and shall indemnify Dragon Systems in respect of the same.",
                "changed_text": "MMI should consider obtaining insurance coverage as it deems necessary for Dragon Systems property. MMI should, if possible, inform Dragon Systems of significant incidents involving Dragon Systems property and may consider offering some compensation.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates MMI to obtain and maintain 'adequate' insurance coverage and immediately notify Dragon Systems of any loss or damage. The modified text weakens these obligations by replacing 'shall' with 'should consider,' and 'adequate' with 'as it deems necessary' which allows MMI to subjectively decide the level of coverage. The mandatory notification is replaced with 'if possible, inform' which is conditional and not assured. The firm obligation to 'indemnify' is weakened to 'may consider offering some compensation,' which is not legally binding. This undermines Dragon Systems' protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to maintain adequate insurance and provide indemnity, conflicting with standard risk allocation principles and potentially violating implied duties of reasonable care under Massachusetts law.",

                "original_text": "\"2. Administration and Risk Management. Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company provide support to portfolio managers and other employees of affiliated advisers. Such services may include development of risk management programs, production of portfolio and compliance reports for clients and/or fund Boards, coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration, completion of required broker and custody documentation, development and documentation of operational procedures, coordination of proxy voting activities, on-site support of hardware and software, etc.\"",
                "changed_text": "\"2. Administration and Risk Management. Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company may offer support to portfolio managers and other employees of affiliated advisers. Such services may, at their discretion, include assistance with risk management programs, the possible creation of portfolio and compliance reports for clients and/or fund Boards, general coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration, suggestions for broker and custody documentation, informal advice on operational procedures, and facilitation of proxy voting activities, as well as occasional hardware and software assistance, etc.\"",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'provide support' with 'may offer support,' 'may include development' with 'may, at their discretion, include assistance with,' changes 'production of portfolio and compliance reports' to 'the possible creation of portfolio and compliance reports,' and weakens the other listed services with similar discretionary phrasing. This introduces ambiguity and reduces the obligation to provide these services, potentially leading to non-compliance with regulatory requirements for investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.",

                "explanation": "By adding \"to the extent practicable\" and stating that Pennsylvania law is a \"helpful, but not necessarily controlling, guide,\" the governing law clause becomes ambiguous. This creates uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws apply, potentially conflicting with established contract law principles in Pennsylvania, which expects clear and unambiguous choice of law provisions.",

The Services Agreement should also remain in effect, mostly without changes, regarding Accounts that are investment companies under the 1940 Act.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'generally' and 'mostly without changes' introduce uncertainty about the extent to which the original and amended agreements are in effect. This ambiguity affects the clarity of obligations regarding different types of accounts, making it difficult to ascertain the precise legal requirements and responsibilities concerning fund management and compliance under the Investment Company Act of 1940.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall produce and submit to the Board, as promptly as possible, a reasonable estimate of their respective income tax liability with respect to the income of the Operating Company computed pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph as by a reasonably prudent taxpayer attempting to reduce the income tax payable by such taxpayer to the greatest extent permitted by law (a \"Party Tax Estimate\").",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may, at its discretion, produce and submit to the Board an estimate of their income tax liability with respect to the income of the Operating Company. This estimate does not necessarily need to reflect calculations made by a reasonably prudent taxpayer.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires each party to produce a reasonable estimate of their tax liability. The modified text makes this discretionary ('may, at its discretion') and removes the 'reasonably prudent taxpayer' standard, making the obligation vague and open to manipulation. This contradicts IRS regulations requiring accurate and good-faith tax estimates.",

                "changed_text": "Such withdrawal should generally be effective around the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be' to 'should generally be' introduces ambiguity about when the withdrawal is actually effective. Adding 'around' introduces vagueness about how close the withdrawal date should be to the 'Effective Date', potentially rendering the withdrawal clause unenforceable and contradicts clearly defined terms in the agreement.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Joint Venture will be managed and controlled by a board of directors comprised of six (6) members (the \"Board\"). Each Party shall appoint three (3) of such members (none of whom shall be residents of the United Kingdom) and shall be entitled to appoint any successor appointees as necessary such that the Board shall always be comprised of three members appointed by each Party. Each Party shall be entitled to appoint alternate directors on a periodic and temporary basis as needed. Each party agrees at all times to vote in favor of the directors appointed by the other Party or any successor appointees.",
                "changed_text": "The Joint Venture may be managed by a board of directors. Each Party should consider appointing members to this board. The frequency of appointments can be determined by the Parties. Parties are encouraged to support each other's appointments but there is no requirement to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a mandatory board of directors with a specific structure and voting agreement. The modified version weakens this obligation by using permissive language ('may be managed,' 'should consider appointing'), removing the mandatory composition of the board, and negating the voting agreement. This ambiguity allows for the possibility that the Joint Venture will not have a functioning board, and will lead to a lack of control over the joint venture.",

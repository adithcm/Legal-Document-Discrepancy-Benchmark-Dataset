                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each should endeavor to file amendments in a timely manner and use reasonable judgement to ensure the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein is reasonably complete and accurate, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, unless they possess direct and irrefutable proof of inaccuracies.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the legal obligation regarding timely filing and accuracy of information. Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation. 'Reasonable judgement' and 'reasonably complete and accurate' are vague and subjective. Requiring 'direct and irrefutable proof' to establish responsibility for others' inaccuracies sets an unrealistically high standard, making it difficult to enforce accountability.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G may be considered filed on behalf of each of the undersigned, and that subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G might be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned, potentially negating the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the filing responsibility uncertain by replacing 'is filed' with 'may be considered filed' and 'shall be filed' with 'might be filed.' The inclusion of 'potentially negating' further weakens the obligation to file joint acquisition statements. This is ambiguous and undermines the explicit requirements for joint filings.",

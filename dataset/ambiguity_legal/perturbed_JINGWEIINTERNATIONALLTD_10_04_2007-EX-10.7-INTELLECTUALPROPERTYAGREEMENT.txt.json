                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Party B agrees to use the Intellectual Property only pursuant to this Agreement and not to use the Intellectual Property by manner of deceit, misleading or others manners that are deemed by Party A as harmful to the Intellectual Property or the reputation of Party A.",
                "changed_text": "Party B agrees to use the Intellectual Property pursuant to this Agreement, but should not intentionally use the Intellectual Property in a deceitful or misleading manner. Party A will communicate any concerns regarding potentially harmful uses to Party B.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation by replacing 'not to use' with 'should not intentionally use,' introducing ambiguity about what constitutes 'intentional' misuse. The requirement to avoid 'others manners that are deemed by Party A as harmful' is replaced with 'Party A will communicate any concerns', reducing Party B's responsibility to proactively avoid harmful uses and making it reactive instead of proactive, which reduces Party B's liability.",

Upon termination of this Agreement, Party B shall return Confidential Information to Party A or destroy it itself and delete Confidential Information from any electronic devices and cease to use them as required by Party A. Party B shall not disclose, grant or transfer any Confidential Information to any third party and will not use the Confidential Information without Party A's written consent.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall endeavor to protect the confidentiality of confidential data received from Party A. Upon termination, Party B will make reasonable efforts to return or destroy Confidential Information. Party B will try not to disclose Confidential Information to third parties without written consent from Party A.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing mandatory actions ('shall protect', 'shall return', 'shall not disclose') with less definite terms ('endeavor to protect', 'will make reasonable efforts', 'will try not to disclose'). This weakens Party B's obligation to maintain confidentiality, making enforcement more difficult. The term 'endeavor' is also open to interpretation, creating an ambiguous standard of care. This contradicts the spirit of Trade Secret Laws of the PRC, which require strict measures for protecting trade secrets.",

                "changed_text": "Party B will generally pay the license fee to the account designated by Party A around December 31 each year. Party A retains the right to potentially consider exempting Party B from the obligation to pay the license fee.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall pay' with 'will generally pay' weakens the obligation to pay the license fee. Adding 'around' introduces ambiguity regarding the payment date. Changing 'has the right to determine whether or not to exempt' to 'retains the right to potentially consider exempting' further weakens Party A's obligation to make a clear decision regarding exemption, making the payment terms unclear and potentially unenforceable. This could conflict with general contract law principles in the PRC that require clarity and certainty in financial obligations.",

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is generally responsible for the filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person suspects the potential for inaccuracy.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear responsibility on each party for the 'timely filing' and 'completeness and accuracy' of their information. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'is responsible' with 'is generally responsible,' weakening the obligation. Furthermore, changing 'knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate' to 'suspects the potential for inaccuracy' lowers the threshold for liability, making it vague and difficult to enforce. This weakens the requirements for accuracy and due diligence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 13, which requires accurate and timely filings to protect investors; ambiguous language undermines this requirement.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in effect until possibly revoked by any party hereto with notification to the other parties, with unclear effect on the revoking party's obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a clear process for revocation - signed writing provided to each other party. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by replacing 'full force and effect' with 'in effect', adding 'possibly' before revoked, using the term 'notification' which is more vague than 'signed writing provided to each other party hereto', and including 'with unclear effect on the revoking party's obligations'. This makes the process and consequences of revocation uncertain.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law principles that require clarity and certainty in termination clauses. The ambiguity makes it difficult to determine when and how the agreement can be terminated, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear agreement to jointly file as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The modified text replaces 'Pursuant to and in accordance with' with 'In general alignment with', weakening the direct link to the Act. 'hereby agree' is replaced with 'express an intent for', making the obligation non-committal. 'any filing required' is replaced with 'potential filings', and 'further agree to the filing' is replaced with 'contemplate incorporating', thus reducing the commitment to specific actions. This introduces significant ambiguity regarding the extent of the parties' obligations under the Exchange Act.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 13, which mandates specific filings; the ambiguous language creates doubt about whether the parties are truly committed to fulfilling these mandatory requirements.",

                "original_text": "Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A shall (i) supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date in compliance with the KGMP, and (ii) manufacture in compliance with the KGMP and in conformity with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the \"Product Specifications\") and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A will use reasonable efforts to (i) supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date while aiming for compliance with the KGMP, and (ii) manufacture while attempting to conform with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the \"Product Specifications\") and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Dong-A 'shall' comply with KGMP. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating Dong-A 'will use reasonable efforts' and 'aiming for compliance,' making the obligation to comply with KGMP less stringent and open to interpretation. Similarly, replacing 'manufacture in compliance' with 'manufacture while attempting to conform' reduces the strictness of conforming to product specifications.",

                "changed_text": "NeuroBo should, at its costs and expenses, endeavor to deliver the API to the place designated by Dong-A approximately [***] days prior to the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo as per the Firm Order.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires NeuroBo 'shall' deliver the API by a specific deadline. The modified text uses 'should endeavor to' making the delivery obligation less mandatory and adds 'approximately' to the delivery date, introducing further ambiguity. These changes weaken the enforcement of a timely delivery, potentially contradicting the requirements for strict adherence to timelines in pharmaceutical manufacturing.",

                "changed_text": "Dong-A may supply NeuroBo with the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, potentially including a certificate of analysis that loosely reflects the Product Specifications, for each batch of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo shipped hereunder, indicating that the batch generally aligns with the Product Specifications.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Dong-A 'shall supply' with a certificate certifying the batch 'meets' specifications. The revised text changes 'shall supply' to 'may supply' and weakens the certification requirement by suggesting the analysis 'loosely reflects' specifications and that the batch 'generally aligns,' rather than meets, the specifications. This introduces ambiguity and reduces the guarantee of compliance with product specifications, potentially violating regulatory requirements for accurate product certification.",

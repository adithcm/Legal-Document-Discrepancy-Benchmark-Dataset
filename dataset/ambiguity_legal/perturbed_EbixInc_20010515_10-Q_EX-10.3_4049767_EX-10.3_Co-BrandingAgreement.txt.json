                "original_text": "About will make commercially reasonable efforts to achieve that number in twelve (12) months or less from the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "About will endeavor to achieve that number within a flexible timeframe from the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'commercially reasonable efforts' to 'endeavor' and replaces the specific 'twelve (12) months or less' with 'a flexible timeframe.' This introduces ambiguity because 'endeavor' is weaker than 'commercially reasonable efforts,' and 'flexible timeframe' lacks a clear deadline, undermining the initial obligation to generate Filled Application Forms within a definite time as agreed upon in the contract. This could make the contract unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, eBix should generally avoid selling, leasing, transferring, disseminating, displaying or disclosing About User data to third parties, unless business needs dictate otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall not' to 'should generally avoid' weakens the obligation, and the added phrase 'unless business needs dictate otherwise' introduces a significant loophole. This phrase is vague and allows ebix to unilaterally decide when disclosing About User data is permissible, making the restriction largely unenforceable. This undermines the confidentiality agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles related to confidentiality and data protection, and potentially state-level data privacy laws.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The ebix Insurance Center shall be operational and fully functionally at least ninety nine percent (99.0%) of the time during the Term, without taking into account scheduled downtime and maintenance which shall not exceed in the aggregate, one (1) hour in any one (1) month period. In the event of any downtime and/or maintenance in excess of the aforementioned amount, such shall be deemed a material breach and ebix shall have twenty four (24) hours in which to cure such breach.",
                "changed_text": "The ebix Insurance Center will aim to be operational most of the time during the Term, with occasional interruptions for maintenance, ideally keeping downtime to a minimum. Extended downtime may be addressed on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces the specific uptime guarantee (99.0%) with the vague 'aim to be operational most of the time.' The clear definition of 'material breach' triggered by exceeding downtime is replaced with 'may be addressed on a case-by-case basis,' removing a clear enforcement mechanism. This weakens the obligation to maintain uptime and introduces uncertainty, making it difficult to prove a breach of contract based on downtime.",

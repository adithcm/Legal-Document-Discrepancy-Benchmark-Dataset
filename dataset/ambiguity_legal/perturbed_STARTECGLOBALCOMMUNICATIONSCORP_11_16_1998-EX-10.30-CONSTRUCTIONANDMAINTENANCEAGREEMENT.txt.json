                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Terminal Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to furnish and maintain, or cause to be furnished and maintained, in working order for the other Parties and for the Purchasers in TAT-14, for the duration of this Agreement, the necessary facilities in their respective Countries as may be reasonably required for extending capacity in TAT-14 assigned to such Parties or Purchasers for the purpose of handling communications transiting the Country involved.",
                "changed_text": "The Terminal Parties will endeavor, as they see fit, to furnish and maintain facilities that might be used by other Parties and Purchasers in TAT-14, subject to their own internal resource availability, for communications transiting the Country.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation to use 'all reasonable efforts' to maintain facilities. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating Terminal Parties 'will endeavor, as they see fit,' making the provision of facilities discretionary. Also, the addition of 'subject to their own internal resource availability' adds another layer of ambiguity.",

                "changed_text": "Each Terminal Party may consider providing, within their Country, a connection to TAT-14 to Parties and Purchasers. The specific standards, conditions, and commercial parameters for any eventual connection should be discussed and documented separately.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the provision of connection. The modified text changes 'shall provide' to 'may consider providing,' making the provision optional. Furthermore, it avoids committing to specific technical standards. This creates ambiguity and makes the connection availability uncertain, contradicting the spirit of fair access and interoperability required by telecommunications regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Each Maintenance Authority should, where feasible and at its discretion, aim to access what it deems necessary system maintenance information, related to its perceived duties.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'prompt access to all system maintenance information.' The modified text weakens this requirement by changing 'shall have' to 'should... aim to,' introducing discretion. The phrase 'what it deems necessary' makes the information access subjective and potentially incomplete, hindering effective maintenance. The original 'necessary to the performance of its duties' also becomes the more ambiguous 'related to its perceived duties'.",

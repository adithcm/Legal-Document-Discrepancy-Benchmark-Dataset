                "original_text": "3.1 By this Agreement, Cisco makes, and Distributor accepts, the appointment of Distributor as an authorized, non-exclusive distributor of Products and Services to Resellers located in the Territory. Distributor agrees to use its best efforts to distribute Product solely to Resellers located in the Territory. Those Resellers may resell Product only to End Users who intend to use the Product in the Territory. All Resellers to which Distributor distributes Product must meet Cisco's then-current guidelines for Resellers, as amended from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 By this Agreement, Cisco makes, and Distributor accepts, the appointment of Distributor as an authorized, non-exclusive distributor of Products and Services to Resellers located in the Territory. Distributor will endeavor to distribute Product to Resellers located in the Territory. Resellers should direct their efforts to resell Product to End Users who intend to use the Product in the Territory. All Resellers to which Distributor distributes Product should aim to meet Cisco's then-current guidelines for Resellers, as amended from time to time.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'agrees to use its best efforts' with 'will endeavor to distribute,' making the obligation to distribute solely within the territory less stringent. Similarly, 'may resell Product only' is weakened to 'should direct their efforts to resell Product', and 'must meet' becomes 'should aim to meet.' This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of territorial restrictions and Reseller compliance standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Ambiguous language makes it difficult to prove a breach of contract based on territorial violations, as the original 'best efforts' and 'must meet' clauses provided a clearer standard for compliance.",

                "original_text": "21.1 Distributor shall obtain all licenses, permits and approvals required by any government, including any recycling or take-back programs applicable to packaging or Products, and shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures and any requirements applicable to the importation, exportation, use, sale, loan, purchase, and distribution of Products under telecommunications, consumer rights related, environmental, labor, tax, and any other laws and regulations, of any government or other competent authority where the Products are to be sold, used or deployed (collectively \"Applicable Laws\").",
                "changed_text": "21.1 Distributor will, when practical, try to obtain licenses, permits, and approvals required by any government, including recycling or take-back programs applicable to packaging or Products, and will strive to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies, and procedures and any requirements applicable to the importation, exportation, use, sale, loan, purchase, and distribution of Products under telecommunications, consumer rights related, environmental, labor, tax, and any other laws and regulations, of any government or other competent authority where the Products are to be sold, used, or deployed (collectively \"Applicable Laws\").",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall obtain' to 'will, when practical, try to obtain' and 'shall comply' to 'will strive to comply,' the legal obligation is weakened. The phrase 'when practical' introduces subjectivity, and 'strive to comply' doesn't guarantee actual compliance. This is ambiguous and contradicts explicit requirements for obtaining licenses and complying with laws, potentially conflicting with various environmental and consumer protection laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Environmental Laws and Consumer Protection Laws - Many environmental laws (e.g., waste disposal regulations) and consumer protection laws (e.g., product safety standards) require strict adherence and permitting, not just 'striving' to comply.",

Distributor shall make these records available for audit by Cisco upon [*****] prior written notice, during regular business hours, at Distributor's principal place of business or such other of Distributor's locations where Distributor may maintain relevant records. [*****].",
                "changed_text": "17.1 With regard to both Distributor and Affiliates' activity, Distributor should aim to keep reasonably detailed records and accounts, aligning with general business practices, of each Product or Service purchased and deployed, Resold, or distributed, including information regarding compliance with Cisco marketing and sales programs, Software usage, and export or transfer. Distributor will consider making these records available for audit by Cisco upon reasonable prior written notice, potentially during business hours, at Distributor's principal place of business or similar locations.",
                "explanation": "The legal obligation to maintain records is weakened by replacing 'shall keep full, true, and accurate records' with 'should aim to keep reasonably detailed records,' which is subjective. Changing 'in accordance with generally-accepted accounting principles' to 'aligning with general business practices' also introduces ambiguity. 'Shall make these records available' becomes 'will consider making these records available,' making the audit process discretionary. This potentially contradicts requirements for accurate financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which mandates stringent record-keeping.",
                "contradicted_law": "Sarbanes-Oxley Act - This act requires public companies and their distributors to maintain stringent and accurate financial records, a higher standard than 'reasonably detailed records' and a discretionary audit process.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Consultant shall devote such time and efforts to the affairs of the Company as is reasonably necessary to render the services contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant shall devote what they consider to be an appropriate amount of time and effort to the affairs of the Company.",
                "explanation": "The term 'what they consider to be an appropriate' introduces ambiguity and subjectivity, making it difficult to enforce a standard of 'reasonably necessary' effort. It allows the Consultant to determine the level of effort with no objective standard, potentially contradicting the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in Florida contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Florida contract law.",
                "location": "Section 4"

                "original_text": "The Company will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will attempt to report amounts paid to the Consultant by possibly filing some form with the Internal Revenue Service if it seems necessary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will regularly report' with 'will attempt to report' and 'as required by law' with 'if it seems necessary' creates ambiguity regarding the Company's obligation to report payments to the Consultant. This contradicts IRS regulations regarding mandatory reporting of payments to independent contractors via Form 1099-MISC.",
                "contradicted_law": "IRS regulations regarding Form 1099-MISC reporting requirements.",
                "location": "Section 5"

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees that its actions should generally align with Federal and State securities laws.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall conform to' into 'should generally align with' weakens the obligation to adhere to securities laws. It suggests that parties only need to generally follow the laws rather than strictly comply with them. The phrase 'generally align' can be interpreted subjectively. This contradicts the strict liability standards of Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC).",

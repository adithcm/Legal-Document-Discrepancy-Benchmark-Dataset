                "changed_text": "University believes that the Program is generally conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including, when feasible, guidelines outlined in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations. The University's interpretation of GCP's and the Form FDA 1572 is considered in its operations.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Program 'is being, and has been, conducted in accordance with all applicable laws.' The modified text weakens this by stating that the University 'believes that the Program is generally conducted in accordance with applicable laws', replacing a statement of fact with a statement of belief. The phrase 'when feasible' introduces further ambiguity and makes adherence to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations discretionary. Finally, saying their 'interpretation...is considered' further reduces the obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., and FDA regulations, which require strict adherence to regulations and GCP guidelines in clinical trials.",

ArTara will add all applicable wire transfer fees to wire transfer payments.",

ArTara will consider covering applicable wire transfer fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'ArTara will include...' which is a clear obligation. The modified text uses 'ArTara will endeavor to include...where practical,' making the inclusion of the agreement number and reference discretionary. Additionally, replacing 'ArTara will add...' with 'ArTara will consider covering...' changes a firm commitment into a possibility.",

                "original_text": "University and/or Principal Investigator shall provide ArTara with a copy of any proposed Publication for review and comment at least […***…] prior to submission thereof for publication. ArTara shall have […***…], after receipt of said copy to object to such proposed Publication because there is Confidential Information which needs protection. In the event that ArTara makes such objection, University and/or Principal Investigator shall refrain from submitting such Publication for a maximum of […***…] from date of receipt of such objection in order for ArTara to file patent application(s) directed to patentable subject matter contained in the proposed Publication.",

ArTara may, within a reasonable timeframe, object to such proposed Publication if it believes there is Confidential Information that needs protection. In the event that ArTara raises concerns, University and/or Principal Investigator will consider delaying submission to allow ArTara to explore patent options.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall provide' creating a legal obligation. This is changed to 'should attempt to provide' making it precatory rather than mandatory. 'ArTara shall have' is changed to 'ArTara may', further weakening the clause. The fixed timeframe is removed, replaced with 'reasonable timeframe', introducing subjectivity. Finally, 'shall refrain from submitting' is replaced with 'will consider delaying submission' further reducing the legal weight.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principle of 'certainty,' which requires the terms of an agreement to be sufficiently clear and definite so that the obligations of each party can be determined with reasonable certainty. Vague and ambiguous language undermines enforceability.",

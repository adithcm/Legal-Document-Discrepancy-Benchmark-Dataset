                "explanation": "The change from 'shall execute and perform in compliance with' to 'should endeavor to execute and perform in general accordance with' weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' and 'general accordance' introduce ambiguity about the level of compliance required, potentially leading to breaches of specific laws.",

                "changed_text": "Moelis Holdings will attempt to cause any Registration Statement to be declared effective, while considering internal resource constraints, and may maintain such Registration Statement for a reasonable period of time, as determined by its internal assessment.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'commercially reasonable efforts' to 'attempt' and adding subjective criteria like 'considering internal resource constraints' and 'as determined by its internal assessment', the obligation to ensure the Registration Statement's effectiveness and currency is weakened. This creates ambiguity and discretion that may contradict SEC regulations requiring diligent and timely registration.",

The specific conditions and limitations of this indemnification will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will indemnify, defend and hold harmless' with 'may, at its discretion, indemnify, defend and hold harmless' makes the indemnification discretionary rather than mandatory. Adding 'The specific conditions and limitations of this indemnification will be determined on a case-by-case basis' introduces further uncertainty. This contradicts established legal precedents and practices related to indemnification in securities offerings, which typically require clear and enforceable obligations.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "You shall faithfully and diligently perform such duties as you are required to undertake from time to time and exclusively devote the whole of your working time, skills, ability and attention to the business of the Company and use your best endeavours to promote the interests and reputation of the Company and (where applicable) any Group Company.",
                "changed_text": "You shall endeavor to perform duties as reasonably required and devote appropriate time and attention to the Company's business, using reasonable efforts to promote the interests and reputation of the Company and any Group Company where applicable.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'faithfully and diligently perform' to 'endeavor to perform duties as reasonably required' and 'exclusively devote the whole of your working time' to 'devote appropriate time and attention' significantly weakens the obligation, making it subjective and open to interpretation. 'Best endeavors' is replaced with 'reasonable efforts', further reducing the stringency. This is an Ambiguous Legal Obligation, which weakens the duty of the employee.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under UK law, specifically the Employment Rights Act 1996, there's an implied term of mutual trust and confidence between employer and employee. This modified clause could be interpreted as undermining the employee's duty of good faith, creating ambiguity regarding their commitment to the company.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall reimburse all reasonable out of pocket expenses properly incurred by you in the performance of the duties under this Agreement including travelling, subsistence and entertainment expenses provided you follow the Company's guidelines/allowances in force at the relevant time and provided that you shall, where reasonably practicable, provide the Company with vouchers, invoices or such other evidence of such expenses as the Company may reasonably require.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may reimburse expenses incurred by you in performing duties under this Agreement, including traveling, subsistence, and entertainment, subject to internal guidelines, and provided you attempt to provide documentation of such expenses.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall reimburse' to 'may reimburse', the obligation to reimburse reasonable expenses becomes discretionary. Also, changing 'provide the Company with vouchers, invoices or such other evidence of such expenses as the Company may reasonably require' to 'attempt to provide documentation of such expenses', the burden of proof and the commitment is lessened. This introduces ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under UK law, specifically the Employment Rights Act 1996, there's an implied term related to reimbursing employees for expenses incurred in the course of their employment. Making this reimbursement discretionary could breach that implied term, especially if expenses are necessary for performing assigned tasks.",

                "original_text": "During the term of your employment and at all times thereafter subject always to your obligations to third parties, you shall furnish such information and proper assistance to the Company or any Group Companies as it or they may reasonably require in connection with the Company's intellectual property (including without limitation applying for, defending, maintaining and protecting such intellectual property) and in connection with litigation in which it is or they are or may become a party.",
                "changed_text": "During your employment and thereafter, you should endeavor to provide information and assistance to the Company regarding its intellectual property and litigation.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall furnish such information and proper assistance' with 'should endeavor to provide information and assistance' weakens the obligation. The original text implies a mandatory duty to assist, while the modified text suggests a voluntary effort, making it ambiguous and less enforceable. The omission of 'as it or they may reasonably require' removes a vital part of the obligation which defines the required information.",
                "contradicted_law": "In the UK, there's a general duty to cooperate with your employer, especially regarding intellectual property developed during employment. By weakening the obligation to provide information and assistance, it could become difficult for the company to enforce its IP rights, and in turn, it may not align with the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.",

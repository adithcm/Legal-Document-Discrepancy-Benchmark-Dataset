                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Agent shall be responsible for maintaining a consumer call center relating to Roundup Products; provided, however, that if there is a medical response call (including human and animal health- related calls) and related FIFRA 6(a)(2) issues, the Agent shall immediately transfer such call to the Monsanto CRC and will immediately report such information to Monsanto.",
                "changed_text": "The Agent shall endeavor to maintain a consumer call center relating to Roundup Products; provided, however, that if there is a medical response call (including human and animal health- related calls) and related FIFRA 6(a)(2) issues, the Agent should attempt to transfer such call to the Monsanto CRC and report such information to Monsanto when practical.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall be responsible' to 'shall endeavor to maintain,' weakening the obligation to maintain a consumer call center. Furthermore, replacing 'shall immediately transfer' with 'should attempt to transfer' and 'will immediately report' with 'report such information to Monsanto when practical' weakens the requirement to promptly address medical response calls and report information, creating a vaguely defined obligation. This potentially conflicts with FIFRA regulations, which require accurate and timely reporting of adverse effects related to pesticide products.",

                "original_text": "The Agent shall use commercially reasonable methods to inform and familiarize its employees, agents, Customers, contractors (including warehousemen and transporters) and others who may handle or use Roundup Products of the potential hazards pertaining thereto (including accidental breakage or fire), and shall stress the safe use and application of Roundup Products in strict accordance with Monsanto's product labels. In addition, the Agent shall provide HM126F training to its personnel as required by the United States Department of Transportation (and such other training as may be required by other countries within the Included Markets). The Agent shall have the responsibility to dispose of waste materials in accordance with all applicable Laws.",
                "changed_text": "The Agent should consider using methods to inform and familiarize its employees, agents, Customers, contractors (including warehousemen and transporters) and others who may handle or use Roundup Products of potential hazards. The agent should consider stressing the safe use of Roundup Products in accordance with Monsanto's product labels as the Agent deems appropriate. Furthermore, the Agent may provide HM126F training to its personnel when feasible. The Agent will attempt to dispose of waste materials in accordance with Laws.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the obligation to promote safe use practices. Replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable methods' with 'should consider using methods' makes the hazard communication discretionary. Removing 'strict' and adding 'as the Agent deems appropriate' weakens the requirement to adhere to product labels, and changing 'shall provide HM126F training' to 'may provide HM126F training when feasible' makes the safety training optional. Changing 'shall have the responsibility' to 'will attempt to dispose' makes the disposal of waste material ambiguous. This contradicts regulations from the EPA or DOT that require specific and mandatory safety measures.",

                "original_text": "The Agent agrees that, to the extent it uses Industrial Property, such Industrial Property shall be used in its standard form and style as it appears upon Roundup Products or as instructed in writing by Monsanto. No other letter(s), word(s), design(s), symbol(s) or other matter of any kind shall be superimposed upon, associated with or shown in such proximity to the Industrial Property so as to tend to alter or dilute such Industrial Property, and the Agent further agrees not to combine or associate any of such Industrial Property with any other industrial property. The generic or common name of the type of product (e.g., \"non-selective herbicide\") must always follow Roundup Products' trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "The Agent agrees that, to the extent it uses Industrial Property, such Industrial Property should generally resemble its standard form and style. The Agent will consider whether other letters, words, designs, or symbols may be associated with the Industrial Property. The Agent will attempt to ensure that the generic name of the product follows Roundup Products' trademarks.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall be used' with 'should generally resemble', the agent's obligation to maintain the brand's integrity is weakened. Furthermore, by replacing 'No other letter(s)...shall be superimposed...' to 'The Agent will consider whether other letters...' creates room for a subjective interpretation of brand protection rules. Lastly, by replacing 'must always follow' with 'will attempt to ensure', ensures the agent might not always fulfill this requirement. This contradicts trademark law, which mandates consistent and clear branding to avoid consumer confusion.",

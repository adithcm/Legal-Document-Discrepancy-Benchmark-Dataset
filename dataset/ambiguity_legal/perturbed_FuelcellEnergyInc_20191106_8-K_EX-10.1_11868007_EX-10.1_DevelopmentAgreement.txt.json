                "original_text": "The Parties have established and maintain standards, policies, and/or guidelines (\"Policies\") applicable to lawful and ethical conduct when conducting their business activities. Upon written request, a Party will provide to the other Party a copy of, or electronic access to, such Policies. The Parties agree to comply with such Policies when conducting activities under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties have established and maintain standards, policies, and/or guidelines (“Policies”) applicable to lawful and ethical conduct when conducting their business activities. Upon written request, a Party may provide to the other Party a copy of, or electronic access to, such Policies. The Parties will endeavor to comply with such Policies when conducting activities under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will provide' to 'may provide' makes the provision of policies discretionary, and replacing 'agree to comply' with 'will endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation to merely trying to comply. This contradicts the **Sarbanes-Oxley Act**, which requires companies to maintain and enforce internal controls, including ethical conduct policies.",

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision will be interpreted or applied so as to require a Party or its Affiliates, to do, or to refrain from doing, anything which would constitute a violation of, or be penalized by, any applicable laws and regulations or result in a loss of economic benefit under such laws or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "All actions by each Party related to this Agreement should generally comply with what they understand to be applicable laws and regulations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision will be interpreted or applied so as to absolutely require a Party or its Affiliates, to do, or to refrain from doing, anything which would definitively constitute a blatant violation of, or be undeniably penalized by, any clearly applicable laws and regulations or result in a complete loss of economic benefit under such laws or regulations.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will comply' to 'should generally comply' introduces ambiguity and reduces the strictness of compliance. Altering the language around violations to 'blatant violation' and 'undeniably penalized' sets a very high and unclear threshold. This may contradict regulations such as the **Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)**, which requires strict compliance with anti-bribery provisions.",

                "explanation": "The wording change replaced 'will keep' with 'will endeavor to keep' introducing a level of effort rather than a hard obligation. It changed 'true books, records, and accounts in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles' to 'books, records, and accounts which generally reflect accepted accounting practices', which is ambiguous. It also changes 'containing all information necessary for the accurate determination' to 'contain information they deem relevant for determining', which introduces subjective judgment on what information to include. This contradicts accounting standards such as **GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)** and the **Sarbanes-Oxley Act**, which mandate accurate and complete financial record-keeping.",

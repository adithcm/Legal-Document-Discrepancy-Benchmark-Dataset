                "changed_text": "Sparkling shall: (a) endeavor not to copy the Software except to copy it onto another AS400 at the Authorized Locations and to make copies of the Software at each Authorized Location solely for backup purposes; (b) consider not copying any of the Documentation except as required for Sparkling's internal purposes related to Sparkling's use of the Software; (c) generally not assign this Agreement or transfer, lease, export or grant a sublicence of the Work to any Person, except as and when authorized to do so by Garman in writing; (d) explore the possibility of reverse engineering, decompiling or disassembling the Software; (e) make a strong effort not to use the Work except as authorized herein; (f) take precautions as they feel are necessary to prevent third parties from using the Work in any way that would constitute a breach of this Agreement including, without limitation, such precautions as Sparkling would otherwise take to protect its own proprietary software or hardware or information; and PAGE 2 (g) avoid using the Work to act as a service bureau in whole or in part, for any other Person, except for any affiliate of Sparkling operating at the Authorized Locations.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the restrictions on Sparkling's use of the software and documentation by replacing definitive terms like 'shall not' with more ambiguous phrases like 'endeavor not to', 'consider not copying', 'generally not', 'explore the possibility of', and 'make a strong effort not to'. This creates uncertainty about Sparkling's obligations, potentially leading to disputes over whether Sparkling has breached the agreement. Specifically, the change to Section (d) introduces the 'exploration' of reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling which would normally be prohibited.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright laws and software licensing regulations generally prohibit reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of software without explicit permission. The ambiguous phrasing weakens these protections.",

                "original_text": "Garman agrees to indemnify Sparkling and hold it harmless from any and all losses, damages and expenses including without limitation, court costs, arbitration fees, penalties, fines, amounts paid in settlement of claims and reasonable legal fees and expenses of investigation (collectively the \"Losses\") which Sparkling or any of its respective officers or directors may incur due to a breach of this warranty. Sparkling shall notify Garman in writing of any such claim within ten calendar days of a responsible officer of Sparkling becoming aware of such claim. If the Work or any portion thereof is held to constitute an infringement of another Person's rights, and use thereof is enjoined, Garman shall, at its election and expense, make every reasonable effort to correct the situation with minimal effect upon the operations of Sparkling and shall either: (a) procure the right to use the infringing element of the Work; (b) procure the right to an element which performs the same function without any material loss of functionality; or (c) replace or modify the element of the Work so that the infringing portion is no longer infringing and still performs the same function without any material loss of functionality.",
                "changed_text": "Garman agrees to consider indemnifying Sparkling and holding it harmless from losses, damages, and expenses, potentially including court costs, arbitration fees, penalties, fines, amounts potentially paid in settlement of claims, and possibly reasonable legal fees and investigation expenses (collectively the \"Losses\") which Sparkling or its officers or directors may vaguely incur if there is arguably a breach of this warranty. Sparkling should attempt to notify Garman in writing of any such claim within what they consider a reasonable time after a responsible officer of Sparkling thinks they became aware of such claim. If the Work arguably infringes, Garman will make an effort to correct the situation with somewhat minimal effect on Sparkling and may try to: (a) get the right to use the infringing part; (b) find something that works similarly; or (c) change the Work so it doesn't infringe and still works okay.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce significant ambiguity and weaken Garman's obligation to indemnify Sparkling. Terms like 'consider indemnifying,' 'potentially including,' 'may vaguely incur,' 'arguably a breach,' 'should attempt,' 'what they consider a reasonable time,' 'thinks they became aware,' 'arguably infringes,' 'will make an effort,' 'somewhat minimal effect,' and 'may try to' all create uncertainty and leave the scope of the indemnity open to interpretation. The original text has a clear obligation to take actions to procure the right to use, replace, or modify infringed elements to avoid an injunction, which is essential in maintaining operational continuity. The changed text makes the mitigation steps optional, subject to Garman's judgment, and leaves it to their discretion to attempt to mitigate the issue",
                "contradicted_law": "Intellectual property law requires a clear and definitive commitment to protect licensees from infringement claims. The weakened indemnity clause could leave Sparkling inadequately protected against potential copyright infringement lawsuits.",

                "original_text": "Should the Software not operate substantially in conformance with the Sparkling's Specifications in all material respects, Garman will use its best efforts to repair the Software under the support agreement at no additional charge to Sparkling. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Garman may charge a fee at its rates set out in the Fee Schedule to provide Software Repair Services which are required due to: (1) failure due to Sparkling operator errors; (2) failure to maintain Software at such updated version or release of the Software provided by Garman to Sparkling, from time to time, at no additional charge as part of the Maintenance Services or otherwise; (3) material modification of the Software by Sparkling; or (4) the Software being transferred to a different networking environment or hardware configuration without the prior written consent of Garman; or (5) any failure of the hardware or the operating system not caused by Garman or the Software.",
                "changed_text": "If the Software does not seem to operate in conformance with Sparkling's Specifications, Garman will think about trying to repair the Software under the support agreement; however, this may not always be free. Garman might charge extra if the problem is because: (1) Sparkling made a mistake; (2) Sparkling didn't keep the Software updated (though Garman might not have given them all the updates); (3) Sparkling changed the Software too much; (4) Sparkling moved the Software without Garman's okay (and even if they got okay, it still might cost extra); or (5) the hardware or operating system messed up (even if it was Garman's fault).",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguity and reduce Garman's responsibility for software repair. 'Does not seem to operate' and 'think about trying' introduce subjectivity and weaken the obligation to repair. The additions of 'may not always be free,' 'though Garman might not have given them all the updates,' and '(and even if they got okay, it still might cost extra)' and '(even if it was Garman's fault)' create uncertainty regarding the conditions under which Garman will provide support and potentially contradict standard software maintenance obligations. The phrase ‘Sparkling made a mistake’ is too broad without explaining the conditions and responsibilities of both Garman and Sparkling.",
                "contradicted_law": "Consumer protection laws and software warranty regulations require clear terms regarding software repair and maintenance. The ambiguous language could lead to disputes over the scope of support and create unfair burden on the user, especially if the updates necessary for the support are not provided or are poorly explained.",

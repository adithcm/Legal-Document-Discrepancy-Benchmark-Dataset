                "changed_text": "The Customer shall endeavor to provide what they believe to be a suitable environment for the Technical Infrastructure, taking into consideration MMMW's general suggestions for a non-humid environment and a temperature range of approximately 60 to 80 degrees F.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on the customer to provide a specific environment. The modified text replaces 'shall provide' with 'shall endeavor to provide' and 'in accordance with MMMW specifications' with 'taking into consideration MMMW's general suggestions'. This introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation less strict and more subjective. The use of 'approximately' further weakens the temperature requirement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under Indiana law (since the environment is crucial for the hardware's functionality). The ambiguous language makes it harder to prove the customer breached their obligation if the equipment fails due to environmental factors.",

MMMW's sole and exclusive obligation under this warranty shall be at its option to repair or exchange any hardware not in satisfactory operating condition. Said obligation shall be subject to the conditions and charges of Section 3, 4 and 5 and the prompt submission of (or notification to MMMW of the problem) the hardware to MMMW for service.",
                "changed_text": "MMMW generally warrants that the Technical Infrastructure will, to a reasonable degree, remain in acceptable operating condition, subject to: 1) MMMW's occasional inspection and general acceptance of the hardware; and 2) what the Customer considers normal use and conditions. MMMW's obligation under this warranty will be to consider repair or exchange of hardware not in satisfactory operating condition. This consideration is subject to the vague conditions and charges mentioned in Sections 3, 4, and 5, and some form of notification to MMMW.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear warranty with specific conditions. The modified version introduces several ambiguities: 'generally warrants,' 'to a reasonable degree,' 'acceptable operating condition,' 'occasional inspection,' 'general acceptance,' 'what the Customer considers normal use,' 'consider repair or exchange,' 'vague conditions,' and 'some form of notification.' These weaken the warranty and give MMMW significant leeway in determining whether it is obligated to provide service. This contradicts the intent of warranty laws, which aim to provide consumers with clear guarantees.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied warranty of merchantability under Indiana law. The ambiguous language makes it difficult for the Customer to enforce the warranty, as MMMW can argue that the conditions were not met due to the vague wording.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be interpreted in a manner generally consistent with principles derived from the laws of the State of Indiana.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Indiana law governs the interpretation of the agreement. The modified text replaces 'shall be interpreted' with 'may be interpreted' and 'in accordance with the laws' with 'in a manner generally consistent with principles derived from the laws.' This creates ambiguity about which laws apply and allows for interpretations that may deviate from Indiana law, potentially conflicting with legal precedent and established business law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring clear choice of law provisions. The ambiguity weakens the enforceability of the choice of law clause and creates uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws govern the contract, opening the door to disputes about applicable law.",

                "changed_text": "i-on will attempt to maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, with exceptions for maintenance. i-on will try to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will maintain' with 'will attempt to maintain' weakens the obligation. Removing the specific hours for maintenance introduces ambiguity, and can be contradictory to business continuity standards. It is ambiguous on what the exceptions might include.",

The Customer incurs the responsibility to determine what restrictions apply and to review the policies and procedures that will be updated continually. The customer is responsible to use the resources with sensitivity to the rights of others. Any conduct by the Customer that in i-on's sole discretion restricts or inhibits any other user, whether a customer of i-on or a user of any other system, from using and enjoying any of i-on's services is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, the posting or transmitting on or through any of i-on's services, any information that is, in i-on's sole discretion, unlawful, obscene, threatening, abusive, libelous, or harmful, or encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any local, state, national, or International law.",
                "changed_text": "The Customer should endeavor to comply with laws, standards, policies, and procedures. The Customer should consider the applicable restrictions and review updated policies and procedures periodically. The customer should attempt to use the resources with sensitivity to the rights of others. Conduct by the Customer that restricts any other user from using i-on's services may be discouraged. This includes posting information that is potentially unlawful or harmful.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'should endeavor to comply,' 'incurs the responsibility' to 'should consider,' 'is responsible' to 'should attempt,' and 'is strictly prohibited' to 'may be discouraged' weakens the mandatory nature of the obligations. Replacing 'in i-on's sole discretion' with a weaker statement removes clear standards, and the word 'potentially' is vague, contradictory to laws about harmful language.",

                "changed_text": "i-on may not be liable under certain circumstances for lost profits or other consequential damages. i-on's liability for damages to the Customer shall be limited to a nominal amount.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will not be liable under any circumstances' to 'may not be liable under certain circumstances' introduces ambiguity. Replacing the specific limitation of liability (one month's fees) with 'a nominal amount' makes the limit vague and unenforceable. The definition of 'certain circumstances' and 'nominal amount' are not clear, this is contradictory to consumer protection laws.",

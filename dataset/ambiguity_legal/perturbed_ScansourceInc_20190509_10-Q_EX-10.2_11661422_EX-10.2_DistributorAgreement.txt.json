                "original_text": "Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor's inventory to support sales. Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor's inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor may attempt to maintain approximately thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor's inventory to support sales. Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor's inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for an extended period, Xplore may consider replenishing the stock to an amount it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text places an obligation on the distributor to maintain a certain stock level. The modified text makes the obligation vague and discretionary. 'Shall use commercially reasonable efforts' is replaced with 'may attempt,' and 'thirty (30) days' is softened to 'approximately thirty (30) days'. Further, Xplore's obligation to replenish stock becomes discretionary ('may consider') and the amount is no longer agreed upon but 'it deems appropriate'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract/Good Faith - by creating ambiguity around a performance obligation, it makes it difficult to enforce the contract fairly, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in contract law under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which is applicable in South Carolina, Florida, and Texas, where the involved companies operate.",

                "original_text": "Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, shall be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement and any additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice shall have no effect.",
                "changed_text": "Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, will generally be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement; however, additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice may be considered on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear rule that the Addendum and Distribution Agreement take precedence over any conflicting terms in purchase orders or invoices. The modified text introduces ambiguity by suggesting that additional or different terms *may* be considered, creating uncertainty about which terms ultimately govern the transaction. This undermines the contractual certainty and potentially allows for inconsistent application of terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract/UCC - This contradicts basic contract law principles and the UCC related to offer and acceptance. By suggesting terms in purchase orders/invoices *may* be considered, it blurs the line of what constitutes an acceptance of terms, creating an unenforceable agreement. It contradicts the UCC sections on offer, acceptance, and battle of the forms.",

                "original_text": "Xplore shall provide to Distributor, at no charge, a means for confirming proof of delivery for Xplore Product shipments when requested by Distributor. Xplore shall provide packing slips for all shipments.",
                "changed_text": "Xplore will endeavor to provide Distributor with a means for confirming proof of delivery for Xplore Product shipments when reasonably requested by Distributor. Xplore may provide packing slips for most shipments.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains two firm obligations: Xplore 'shall' provide proof of delivery and packing slips. The modified text weakens these obligations with 'will endeavor to' (suggesting an attempt, but not a guarantee) and 'when reasonably requested' (introducing subjective judgment), and 'may provide packing slips for most shipments' (making providing packing slips discretionary).",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - By weakening these obligations, Xplore creates an opportunity for breaching the contract if proof of delivery or packing slips are not consistently provided. This is especially problematic if the Distribution Agreement has clauses tied to proof of delivery. The added ambiguity in South Carolina, Florida, or Texas courts could create difficulties in enforcing the distributor's rights.",

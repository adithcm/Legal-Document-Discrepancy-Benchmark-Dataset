                "original_text": "Subject to Auriemma's obligations as the head coach for the University of Connecticut women's basketball team the United States Women's Olympic basketball team, Auriemma shall make himself available for those appearances set forth on Schedule A.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to Auriemma's obligations as the head coach for the University of Connecticut women's basketball team and the United States Women's Olympic basketball team, Auriemma will endeavor to make himself available for appearances as outlined in Schedule A, resources permitting.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Auriemma 'shall make himself available'. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'will endeavor' and adding 'resources permitting', making Auriemma's availability uncertain and discretionary. This creates a contradiction because Berkshire is paying for guaranteed services.",

                "changed_text": "Berkshire may use the Auriemma Identification in a manner that it believes is generally consistent with Auriemma's image. The inclusion of legends, markings, and notices of trademark rights is at Berkshire's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Berkshire 'shall use the Auriemma Identification only in such a form and manner as is specifically approved by Auriemma.' The modified text replaces 'shall use' with 'may use' and eliminates the requirement for specific approval from Auriemma, giving Berkshire broad, discretionary control over the use of Auriemma's likeness. This contradicts trademark law, which requires brand owners to control the use of their marks.",

The modified version replaces 'wholly outside the control' with 'reasonably believe to be outside their direct control', which is much vaguer, and replaces 'subject to the obligation of...promptly notifying' with 'may be provided when feasible', making the notification requirement discretionary. This introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes a qualifying event and when notification is actually required.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law regarding the enforceability of force majeure clauses. Clear and unambiguous language is typically required to invoke such a clause; vague language can render the clause unenforceable.",

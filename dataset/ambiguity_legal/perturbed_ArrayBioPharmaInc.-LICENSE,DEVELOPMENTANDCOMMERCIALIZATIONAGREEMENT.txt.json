                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "(a) Ono's Responsibility. Except as provided below, Ono shall be responsible for, and shall control the conduct of, the Commercialization of the Products in the Ono Territory, at its expense, in accordance with Section 8.1.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Ono's Responsibility. Except as provided below, Ono may be responsible for, and may have control of the conduct of, the Commercialization of the Products in the Ono Territory, at its expense, in accordance with Section 8.1.",
                "explanation": "The term 'shall be responsible' and 'shall control' indicates a mandatory obligation. By changing it to 'may be responsible' and 'may have control,' the obligation becomes discretionary. This introduces ambiguity, as it is no longer clear whether Ono is definitely responsible for commercialization, potentially conflicting with requirements for diligence in pharmaceutical commercialization.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change can be seen as contradictory to the general principles of contract law, which expects parties to fulfill their agreed-upon obligations with diligence, depending on the context and jurisdiction.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Ono shall use Diligent Efforts to carry out, and to cause its Affiliates and Sublicensees to carry out, all Commercialization of the Products in the Ono Territory in accordance with the then-current Commercialization Plan and the provisions of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Ono shall consider using Diligent Efforts to carry out, and to encourage its Affiliates and Sublicensees to carry out, all Commercialization of the Products in the Ono Territory in accordance with the then-current Commercialization Plan and the provisions of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use Diligent Efforts' with 'shall consider using Diligent Efforts' weakens the obligation, making it unclear whether Ono is truly committed to the commercialization plan. Similarly, 'cause its Affiliates and Sublicensees to carry out' has been replaced with 'encourage its Affiliates and Sublicensees to carry out.' This creates ambiguity, as 'encourage' is less binding than 'cause.'",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing: Even without specific laws in the US, the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance of a contract. By weakening the obligation to use diligent efforts, the modified text could be interpreted as a breach of this duty if Ono fails to adequately commercialize the product. This breach is increased due to the ambiguity introduced in the language.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Marketing Materials, training manuals and/or Educational Materials developed and used by Ono, its Affiliates and Sublicensees for the Product in the Ono Territory shall be consistent with the Marketing Approval in the applicable country and with the reasonable trademark guidelines for use of the Binimetinib Product Trademark and Encorafenib Product Trademark agreed upon by the JCC, and shall comply with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Marketing Materials, training manuals and/or Educational Materials developed and used by Ono, its Affiliates and Sublicensees for the Product in the Ono Territory should generally be consistent with the Marketing Approval in the applicable country and with the trademark guidelines for use of the Binimetinib Product Trademark and Encorafenib Product Trademark, and will aim to comply with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be consistent' to 'should generally be consistent' makes the consistency requirement less strict, introducing subjectivity. Similarly, replacing 'shall comply' with 'will aim to comply' weakens the compliance requirement, creating ambiguity about the level of adherence to applicable laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Adherence to marketing regulations is weakened. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stringent regulations in the US regarding marketing of drugs. These regulations ensure the marketing information is not misleading and accurately presents the drug's efficacy and safety profile. While FDA regulations may not directly apply in Japan or South Korea ('Ono Territory'), failing to strictly comply could lead to actions by regulatory bodies in those countries if the products are exported.",

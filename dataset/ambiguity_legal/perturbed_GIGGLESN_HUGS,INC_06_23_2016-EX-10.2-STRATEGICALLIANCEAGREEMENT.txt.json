                "changed_text": "Consultant shall endeavor to provide services including the following:",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'best efforts' with 'endeavor' weakens the obligation. 'Best efforts' is generally interpreted as a high standard, while 'endeavor' implies a less stringent requirement, creating ambiguity regarding the level of commitment required. This could conflict with general contract law principles requiring good faith performance.",

                "original_text": "Consultant will not disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information of the Company to third parties other than as required to perform the Services. Consultant agrees to take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information of the Company in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons other than those persons authorized under this Agreement to have any such information.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant will aim to not disclose Confidential Information of the Company to third parties, except as deemed necessary. Consultant agrees to take measures to protect Confidential Information of the Company.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will not disclose' to 'will aim to not disclose' and 'all reasonable measures' to 'measures' significantly weakens the obligation to protect confidential information. 'Aim to not disclose' is a goal, not a guarantee, and 'measures' lacks the specificity of 'all reasonable measures,' creating ambiguity and making enforcement difficult. This contradicts California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA), which requires specific and consistent efforts to maintain secrecy.",

Should the meeting either not take place or not result in a resolution of the Dispute within thirty (30) days following notice of the Dispute to the other party, then either party may bring suit or action in accordance with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The parties may consider attempting to resolve any disputes relating to this Agreement. If a resolution is not achieved, either party retains the option to pursue legal action.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agree to attempt to resolve' to 'may consider attempting to resolve' makes dispute resolution optional rather than obligatory. Removing the requirement for a meeting and the 30-day timeframe creates significant ambiguity and weakens the dispute resolution process. This contradicts California's public policy favoring alternative dispute resolution and can make enforcing the contract more difficult and costly.",

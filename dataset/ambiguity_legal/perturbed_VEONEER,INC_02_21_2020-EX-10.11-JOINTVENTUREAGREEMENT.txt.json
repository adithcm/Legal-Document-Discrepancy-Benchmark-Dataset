                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be generally guided by the principles of Japanese law, but specific interpretations may consider international business practices.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that the agreement be governed by Japanese law. The modified version introduces ambiguity by suggesting only general guidance from Japanese law and allowing for consideration of 'international business practices,' which is vague and could contradict specific legal requirements under Japanese law. This creates uncertainty about which laws truly govern the agreement, potentially leading to disputes and non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the Nissin Parties will encourage VNBJ and VNBZ to consider compliance with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement regarding indemnification or reimbursement, as they deem reasonable, of Directors and Officers (excluding those individuals resigning per Section 6.2.6 of the VNBJ SPA and Section 6.2.6 of the VNBZ SPA) for Liabilities arising before the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates Nissin Parties to ensure VNBJ and VNBZ comply with specific sections regarding indemnification. The change weakens this to 'encourage' consideration, introduces subjective 'as they deem reasonable' criteria, thus potentially failing to meet legal indemnification obligations of directors and officers as legally required under Japanese corporate law.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states the JV Agreement will cease to have any effect to VNBJ. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by using 'should generally cease' and suggesting 'some rights and obligations might be subject to further negotiation.' This creates uncertainty whether the agreement ends, contradicting the initial intention of the original contract.",

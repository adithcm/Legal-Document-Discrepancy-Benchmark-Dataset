                "changed_text": "FCC will endeavor to maintain manufacturing capacity and staffing to manufacture the Terpene Product pursuant to the terms hereof at the Facility.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires FCC to 'maintain adequate manufacturing capacity,' which is a clear obligation. Changing it to 'endeavor to maintain' weakens the obligation, making it unclear what level of capacity FCC is actually required to maintain. This creates ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult.",

                "changed_text": "Each party hereto agrees to make reasonable efforts to comply with applicable federal, state provincial and or local environmental law, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations and permits and to handle all raw materials, off specification product, excess or scrap materials, waste, and finished products in a manner they deem reasonably safe so as to minimize contamination of the structure, soil or ground water in, on, or adjacent to its premises.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with environmental laws and safe handling of materials to prevent contamination. The modified text uses 'make reasonable efforts,' weakening the requirement and making it discretionary. The change from 'environmentally safe manner' to 'manner they deem reasonably safe' makes it subjective, and the change from 'prevent' to 'minimize' contamination introduces further ambiguity about the acceptable level of contamination. This contradicts strict liability provisions of environmental laws like CERCLA and the Clean Water Act, which often require more than just 'reasonable efforts' to comply.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'warrants' with 'represents' weakens the guarantee. Adding 'aim to' makes the obligations aspirational rather than mandatory. 'Generally conform,' 'generally comply,' 'acceptable condition in most respects,' and 'generally free from any significant defect' are all highly subjective and ambiguous, undermining the clear requirements of the original text. This could conflict with consumer protection laws and warranty laws, as the diluted language provides very little actual assurance of product quality or compliance.",

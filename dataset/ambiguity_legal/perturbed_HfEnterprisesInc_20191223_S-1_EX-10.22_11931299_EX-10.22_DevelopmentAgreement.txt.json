                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Developer shall be fully liable, without limitation, for money damages resulting from its improper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to provide functional and merchantable Improvements hereunder, which failure shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Developer.",
                "changed_text": "Developer shall be liable for money damages, to the extent deemed reasonable, resulting from its improper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to provide Improvements hereunder. Such failure may be considered a breach of this Agreement by Developer.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'to the extent deemed reasonable,' liability becomes subjective and potentially unenforceable. Replacing 'functional and merchantable Improvements' with just 'Improvements' reduces the standard of performance required. Changing 'shall be deemed a material breach' to 'may be considered a breach' weakens the consequences of non-performance. This contradicts contract law principles that expect clearly defined liability and remedies for breaches, potentially making it difficult to enforce the agreement in New York.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Developer covenants that it shall not attempt, directly or indirectly, during the term of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, (i) to reverse engineer, by any means whatsoever, the Technology or other Intellectual Property provided to Developer hereunder, for any unauthorized purpose, and further acknowledges that such Technology and Intellectual Property has been provided hereunder by DSS solely for the purpose of enabling Developer to fully perform its legal duties and obligations hereunder, (ii) to forensically, graphically or otherwise physically analyze the Technology or Intellectual Property provided to Developer hereunder for any unauthorized purpose, or (iii) to compile/assemble, decrypt, or create any derivative works based upon the Technology or Intellectual Property of DSS, for any unauthorized purpose. Any violation of this clause shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by the Developer.",
                "changed_text": "Developer will endeavor not to attempt, directly or indirectly, during the term of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, (i) to reverse engineer, by reasonable means, the Technology or other Intellectual Property provided to Developer hereunder, for any unauthorized purpose, (ii) to forensically, graphically or otherwise physically analyze the Technology or Intellectual Property, if practical. Any violation of this clause might be considered a breach of this Agreement by the Developer.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not attempt' to 'will endeavor not to attempt' makes the obligation less strict. Specifying 'by reasonable means' introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes reverse engineering. Adding 'if practical' to the analysis clause makes it conditional. Replacing 'shall be deemed a material breach' with 'might be considered a breach' reduces the severity of the consequence. These changes weaken the protections for DSS's intellectual property rights, potentially conflicting with New York law regarding trade secret protection and contractual obligations.",

                "changed_text": "All notices sent under this Agreement should be in writing and may be considered effectively given (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified; (ii) when sent by e-mail, if confirmation is received; (iii) when sent by mail; or (iv) after deposit with a courier.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be' to 'should be' makes the requirement for written notices less mandatory. Replacing 'shall be deemed effectively given' with 'may be considered effectively given' introduces uncertainty about when a notice is legally valid. Removing requirements for PDF format, confirmed facsimile, registered/certified mail, return receipt, postage prepaid, specifying 2-day delivery, and written verification of receipt, creates substantial ambiguity about proper notice. This ambiguity undermines the ability to reliably enforce the agreement's terms under New York law, which requires clarity in contractual provisions.",

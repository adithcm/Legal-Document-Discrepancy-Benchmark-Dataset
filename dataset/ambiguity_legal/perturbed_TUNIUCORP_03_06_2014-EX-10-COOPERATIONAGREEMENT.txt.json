                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "Party B may, at its discretion, periodically review the Service Fee and potentially adjust it as it sees fit, without explicitly requiring the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Party B has the right to adjust the service fee at its own discretion without prior consent. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'may,' 'periodically review,' and 'potentially adjust as it sees fit.' This makes the obligation less clear, which could be interpreted as giving Party A and its subsidiaries less protection against arbitrary fee increases, potentially contravening fair trade practices under PRC law.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Party A hereby expressly undertakes that it waives the right to request amendment and revocation of any term of this Agreement on the ground of material misunderstanding or unconscionability, regardless of whether such request is based on the percentage and amount of payment specified hereunder or the quantity and quality of any service provided by Party B, or is raised against the provisions under which Party A is prohibited from having any cooperation with a third party and conducting any businesses other than those agreed hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "Party A seemingly waives its right to request amendment and revocation of any term of this Agreement on the ground of material misunderstanding or unconscionability; however, the specific extent of this waiver should be interpreted reasonably.",
                "explanation": "The original text is a clear and explicit waiver. The modified text uses 'seemingly waives' and introduces the phrase 'the specific extent of this waiver should be interpreted reasonably.' This introduces ambiguity and undermines the explicitness of the original waiver. Under PRC law, waivers must be clear and unambiguous to be enforceable. This change introduces doubt as to whether Party A has truly waived its rights, especially in cases of gross unconscionability, potentially violating provisions aimed at protecting parties from unfair contract terms.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Neither Party shall disclose the financial and technical information obtained in the course of conclusion of this Agreement to any third party nor use such information for matters irrelevant to this Agreement, regardless of written or oral information, unless the other Party gives a prior written consent thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should endeavor to maintain the confidentiality of financial and technical information shared during this Agreement, refraining from disclosing it to third parties or using it for purposes significantly irrelevant to this Agreement, unless reasonably approved by the other Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that 'Neither Party shall disclose...' creating a clear prohibition. The modified version softens this by stating 'Each Party should endeavor to maintain the confidentiality...' replacing a strict obligation with a weaker, less enforceable one. Additionally, replacing 'irrelevant' with 'significantly irrelevant' and 'prior written consent' with 'reasonably approved' introduces subjective judgments. This ambiguity reduces the enforceability of the confidentiality clause under PRC law, especially in cases involving trade secrets, where a stricter standard of confidentiality and explicit consent for disclosure are often required for legal protection.",

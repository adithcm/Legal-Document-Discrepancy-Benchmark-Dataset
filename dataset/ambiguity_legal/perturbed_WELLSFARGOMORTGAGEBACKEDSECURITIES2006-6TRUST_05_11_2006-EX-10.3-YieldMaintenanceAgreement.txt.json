                "original_text": "UBS AG agrees and acknowledges that Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation (the \"Depositor\") is required under Regulation AB under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") (\"Regulation AB\"), to disclose certain financial information regarding UBS AG, depending on the aggregate \"Significance Percentage\" (as defined in Item 1115 of Regulation AB) of all Transactions under this Agreement, together with any other transactions that fall within the meaning of \"derivative contracts\" for the purposes of Item 1115 of Regulation AB between UBS AG and Counterparty, as calculated from time to time in accordance with the Calculation Methodology (as defined below).\n\n(ii) It shall be a swap disclosure event (\"Swap Disclosure Event\") if, on any Business Day after the date hereof, the Depositor notifies UBS AG the Significance Percentage has reached one of the thresholds for significance of derivative contracts set forth in Item 1115 of Regulation AB (based on a reasonable determination by the Depositor, in good faith and using the Calculation Methodology, of such Significance Percentage).\n\n(iii) Upon the occurrence of a Swap Disclosure Event, UBS AG, at its own expense, shall (a) provide to the Depositor the applicable Swap Financial Disclosure (as defined below), (b) secure another entity to replace UBS AG as party to this Agreement on terms substantially similar to this Agreement and subject to prior notification to the Swap Rating Agencies, which entity (or a guarantor therefor) meets or exceeds the Approved Rating Thresholds (or which satisfies the Rating Agency Condition) and which entity is able to provide the appropriate Swap Financial Disclosure or (c) obtain a guaranty of UBS AG's obligations under this Agreement from an affiliate of UBS AG that is able to comply with the financial information disclosure requirements of Item 1115 of Regulation AB, such that disclosure provided in respect of the affiliate will, in the judgment of counsel to the Depositor, satisfy any disclosure requirements applicable to the Swap Provider, cause such affiliate to provide Swap Financial Disclosure and cause such affiliate to provide indemnity for the Swap Financial Disclosure that is reasonably acceptable to the Depositor. If permitted by Regulation AB, any required Swap Financial Disclosure may be provided by reference to or incorporation by reference from reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act.",
                "changed_text": "UBS AG acknowledges that Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation (the \"Depositor\") may be required under Regulation AB under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") (\"Regulation AB\"), to disclose certain financial information regarding UBS AG, depending on the aggregate \"Significance Percentage\" (as defined in Item 1115 of Regulation AB) of all Transactions under this Agreement. \n\n(ii) A swap disclosure event (\"Swap Disclosure Event\") might occur if, on any Business Day after the date hereof, the Depositor notifies UBS AG the Significance Percentage has potentially reached one of the thresholds for significance of derivative contracts set forth in Item 1115 of Regulation AB.\n\n(iii) Upon the possible occurrence of a Swap Disclosure Event, UBS AG, at its discretion, may (a) consider providing to the Depositor the applicable Swap Financial Disclosure, (b) attempt to secure another entity to replace UBS AG as party to this Agreement on terms substantially similar to this Agreement and subject to notification to the Swap Rating Agencies, or (c) explore obtaining a guaranty of UBS AG's obligations under this Agreement from an affiliate of UBS AG. If permitted by Regulation AB, any required Swap Financial Disclosure might be provided by referencing reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'is required' to 'may be required,' 'shall' to 'might' and 'at its own expense, shall' to 'at its discretion, may consider.' This weakens the mandatory obligation for UBS AG to provide necessary financial disclosures under Regulation AB. It also adds uncertainty around the occurrence of a Swap Disclosure Event and the actions UBS AG needs to take if such event occurs. By using words such as 'potentially reached,' 'attempt,' and 'explore,' the obligation to provide Swap Financial Disclosure becomes discretionary. These changes undermine the specific disclosure requirements of Regulation AB.",

(\"Moody's) within thirty (30) days of such Ratings       Event and subject to written confirmation from Fitch and Moody's that       delivery of such collateral in the context of such downgrade will not       result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of the then current       ratings assigned to the Certificates. For the avoidance of doubt, a       downgrade of the rating on Wells Fargo Mortgage Backed Securities 2006-6       Trust, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-6, Class I-A-22       (the \"Certificates\") could occur in the event that UBS AG does not post       sufficient collateral.",
                "changed_text": "If a Ratings Event occurs with respect to UBS AG, then UBS AG will endeavor, at its discretion, to (i) consider assigning this Transaction hereunder to a third party within a reasonable timeframe of such Ratings Event, or (ii) attempt to deliver collateral acceptable in a generally appropriate form and amount. A downgrade of the rating on the Certificates might occur if UBS AG does not post what is deemed sufficient collateral.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces the firm obligation 'shall' with 'will endeavor, at its discretion, to consider' and 'attempt to deliver' making the action optional. The specific 30-day deadline is replaced with 'reasonable timeframe,' introducing vagueness. The explicit requirement of acceptability to Fitch and Moody's is weakened to 'generally appropriate form and amount.' The strong statement 'could occur' is softened to 'might occur.' This diminishes the mandatory nature of addressing the Ratings Event, making it less enforceable and potentially non-compliant with requirements to maintain the Certificates' ratings.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes 'shall be permitted...unless Moody's and Fitch...confirm in writing' to 'may be considered without providing reasonable notice' significantly weakening the requirement for rating agency confirmation before any transaction modification. Removing the explicit requirement for written confirmation from Moody's and Fitch introduces ambiguity. By stating that \"UBS is under no strict obligation to ensure confirmation from any rating agency,\" the requirement for obtaining rating agency confirmation is made ambiguous, rendering the protective covenant unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Philips shall maintain a delivery capacity, which allows Philips to deliver the Products in accordance with the Lead Times, Forecasts and Purchase Orders, but always subject to the supply limitations, if any, outlined in the Production Plan. Such Production Plan may be updated, and the production capacity may be increased only by the Parties' written agreement and any reasonable additional incremental (and documented) investment required to exclusively satisfy such increase shall be borne by Customer. Philips shall not be held liable for rejecting any Purchase Order through which the volume in any Contract Year or the relevant quarter exceeds the volume indicated in the Production Plan.",
                "changed_text": "Philips shall endeavor to maintain a delivery capacity, considering Lead Times, Forecasts, and Purchase Orders, subject to production limitations outlined in the Production Plan. The Production Plan may be updated at Philips' discretion. Philips' liability for rejecting Purchase Orders exceeding the Production Plan will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguities by replacing 'shall maintain' with 'shall endeavor to maintain,' making the obligation less strict. Removing the requirement for written agreement to update the Production Plan gives Philips unilateral control. Finally, replacing 'shall not be held liable' with 'will be determined on a case-by-case basis' creates uncertainty regarding liability for rejecting Purchase Orders. This contradicts contract law principles in the Netherlands, where clear and predictable obligations are favored. This could violate the principle of *redelijkheid en billijkheid* (reasonableness and fairness), particularly if Philips uses this ambiguity to unfairly reject orders.",

                "original_text": "Customer shall provide Philips in good faith on a monthly basis, on the later of (i) seven (7) days prior to the beginning of each calendar month a rolling [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] forecast for the Products (including the major configuration of each Product such as field strength) (\"Forecast\") it expects to purchase during such [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] period. Such Forecast shall be provided in writing or in any other mutually agreed manner of communication (e.g., EDI or email). Notwithstanding any other obligation set forth herein, Customer shall give Philips at least [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] prior written notice if, during the Term, it intends to discontinue the purchase of any Products hereunder, or if it intends to substantially decrease, versus the Forecast, its purchase demand hereunder. For greater certainty, if Philips (or an Affiliate of Philips) is delayed in delivering any \"Forecast\" contemplated by the RPA, the Customer's obligations to deliver the Forecast hereunder (solely in respect of that portion of the Forecast that corresponds to the volume of Product to be sold to Philips (or an Affiliate of Philips) pursuant to the RPA) shall be tolled until Philips (or an Affiliate of Philips) delivers the corresponding \"Forecast\" under the RPA.",
                "changed_text": "Customer should provide Philips with forecasts for Products, though the method and frequency of these forecasts will be at Customer's convenience. Customer will attempt to provide notice if it intends to discontinue or substantially decrease its purchase demand. Delays by Philips in providing its own forecasts under the RPA may, at Philips' discretion, affect the timing of Customer's forecast obligations.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'shall provide' with 'should provide,' weakening the obligation. It also replaces 'in good faith on a monthly basis' with vague language about 'Customer's convenience,' introducing uncertainty. The statement about Philips' delays affecting Customer's obligations is now discretionary ('may, at Philips' discretion'), further weakening the agreement. This is a violation of good faith principles in the Netherlands because it allows one party to arbitrarily alter forecast requirements. This could run afoul of *artikelen 6:2 en 6:248 Burgerlijk Wetboek* (Dutch Civil Code), which dictate acting reasonably and in good faith.",

Philips believes the Products are new and suitable for their intended purpose. Philips aims for sound workmanship and good quality, but minor defects may be present.

Products will, to Philipsâ€™ knowledge, be free of liens and encumbrances. Philips will endeavor to comply with the terms of the agreement and Purchase Orders.",
                "explanation": "This rewording significantly weakens Philips' warranties. Replacing 'conform to the Specifications' with 'generally conform' introduces ambiguity. Using 'Philips believes' instead of a direct warranty regarding the newness and fitness of the products significantly reduces the strength of this point. Substituting 'aims for' in place of 'are of sound workmanship' also introduces doubt. Replacing 'comply in all respects' with 'strives to comply...to the best of its understanding' is another weakening alteration. This creates a situation where Philips' obligations are not clearly defined or enforceable, violating the principle of certainty in Dutch contract law, namely article 6:227 of the Dutch Civil Code ('*Burgerlijk Wetboek*'), where performance has to be reasonably determinable.",

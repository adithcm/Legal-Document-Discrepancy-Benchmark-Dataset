                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Aimmune shall conduct the Development Activities in accordance with sound and ethical business and scientific practices, and in compliance with all Applicable Law, including GCPs and GLPs, and also including all applicable data privacy and data protection laws.",
                "changed_text": "Aimmune shall endeavor to conduct the Development Activities in accordance with what it considers sound business and scientific practices, and will attempt to comply with Applicable Law, including GCPs and GLPs, and will also attempt to comply with applicable data privacy and data protection laws.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation to comply with laws and ethical standards by changing 'shall conduct...in compliance' to 'shall endeavor to conduct...and will attempt to comply'. This creates ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult.",
                "contradicted_law": "This potentially contradicts regulations like FDA guidelines and GDPR, which mandate strict adherence to specific protocols and standards, not merely 'attempts' to comply.",

                "original_text": "Aimmune shall provide a [***] safety report in connection with the Development of the Product. Aimmune shall determine, [***], the contents and frequency of such reports, but in any event such reports will be made as [***] for Xencor to remain informed of the safety status of the Product to assess, monitor and report to Regulatory Authorities information relevant to the safety of Product in connection with Xencor's efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval of products that are not the Product and that [***], and comply with Applicable Laws.",
                "changed_text": "Aimmune may provide a safety report in connection with the Development of the Product when Aimmune deems it practical. Aimmune will determine, at its discretion, the contents and frequency of such reports, but in any event such reports will be created if considered useful for Xencor to remain informed of the safety status of the Product to generally assess, monitor, and report, if necessary, to Regulatory Authorities information, if relevant, to the safety of Product in connection with Xencor's efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval of products.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguity and weaken the obligation. 'Shall provide' becomes 'may provide...when Aimmune deems it practical', and 'shall determine' becomes 'will determine at its discretion'. This introduces subjectivity and makes it difficult to enforce regular safety reporting.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts regulations by the FDA, EMA or other Regulatory Authorities that require consistent, timely and substantive safety reports during drug development.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term and for [***] ([***]) years thereafter, Aimmune will make reasonable efforts to keep records pertaining to the sale or other disposition of Product. The level of detail will be what Aimmune believes is adequate for its own internal purposes, and Aimmune will consider, but is not obligated, to cause its Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep and provide such records to Xencor.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation to keep and provide accurate records. Replacing 'shall keep' with 'will make reasonable efforts to keep' and adding subjectivity regarding the level of detail introduces ambiguity and makes it more difficult for Xencor to audit effectively.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with auditing requirements under US GAAP or IFRS which require accurate and verifiable records for revenue recognition and royalty payments.",

                "original_text": "Medica shall promptly notify Vapotherm if it experiences any significant problems in manufacturing Cartridges, shall use [* * *] efforts to resolve those problems, and shall keep Vapotherm informed of the status of those efforts.",
                "changed_text": "Medica should endeavor to notify Vapotherm if it encounters what it perceives as notable issues during Cartridge manufacturing and will make reasonable attempts to address them, updating Vapotherm as deemed fit.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall promptly notify' to 'should endeavor to notify' introduces ambiguity by weakening the obligation to report significant manufacturing problems. Replacing 'shall use [* * *] efforts to resolve those problems' with 'will make reasonable attempts to address them' makes the required effort level vague. Additionally, changing 'shall keep Vapotherm informed of the status of those efforts' to 'updating Vapotherm as deemed fit' introduces discretion regarding updates, conflicting with requirements for transparency in manufacturing processes for medical devices.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 820 (FDA Quality System Regulation) which requires strict documentation and reporting of manufacturing deviations and corrective actions.",

                "original_text": "Medica shall maintain all records necessary to evidence compliance with all applicable Laws and other requirements of applicable Governmental Authorities relating to the manufacture of the Cartridge. Medica shall also maintain records with respect to its costs, obligations, and performance under this Agreement. All such records shall be maintained for a period of not less than two years from the date of expiration of each Cartridge batch to which those records pertain, or such longer period as may be required by Law or cGMPs.",
                "changed_text": "Medica should maintain records it considers sufficient to demonstrate alignment with relevant Laws and requirements from Governmental Authorities concerning Cartridge production. Medica may also keep records regarding its expenses, duties, and performance under this contract. These records should generally be kept for around two years after each Cartridge batch expires, unless there is a compelling reason to keep them longer.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Medica 'shall maintain all records necessary'. The perturbed text changes this to 'should maintain records it considers sufficient'. This introduces subjectivity, allowing Medica to decide what is sufficient rather than adhering to objective legal requirements. The original text states that 'all such records shall be maintained for a period of not less than two years'. The perturbed text states that 'these records should generally be kept for around two years, unless there is a compelling reason to keep them longer'. The word 'generally' makes the two-year minimum retention period non-binding. The phrase 'compelling reason' is ambiguous and allows the manufacturer to decide whether or not to retain the records for the minimum period.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 820.180 (FDA's Record Keeping requirements for medical devices), which specifies minimum retention periods for device master records, device history records, and quality system records.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Vapotherm and Medica shall each comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws that pertain to the activities for which Vapotherm and Medica are each responsible under this Agreement and, except as provided for herein, shall bear their own cost and expense of complying therewith.",
                "changed_text": "Vapotherm and Medica should generally strive to adhere to relevant Laws concerning their respective activities under this Agreement and will typically cover their own expenses related to compliance, unless otherwise specified.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall each comply in all material respects' to 'should generally strive to adhere to' weakens the obligation to comply with applicable laws. The term 'material respects' implies that a party must adhere to the substance and essence of the law, but replacing it with 'generally strive to adhere' allows for non-compliance without explicitly defining the circumstances under which this is permissible. The phrase 'will typically cover' in place of 'shall bear' creates an ambiguity where there was originally a firm commitment. This implies there might be exceptions where costs aren't covered.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change contradicts the foundational principle of legal compliance required across all industries, and specifically in the medical device industry under regulations such as 21 CFR Part 820, which mandates full compliance, not just a general striving towards compliance.",

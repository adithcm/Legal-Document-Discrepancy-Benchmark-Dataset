                "original_text": "2.9 Licensed Users shall use the Licensed Mark in a form which is in accordance with sound trademark practice so as not to weaken the value of the Licensed Mark. Licensed Users shall use the Licensed Mark in a manner that does not derogate, based on an objective business standard, Licensor's rights in the Licensed Mark or the value of the Licensed Mark, and shall take no action that would, based on an objective standard, interfere with, diminish or tarnish those rights or value.",
                "changed_text": "2.9 Licensed Users should endeavor to use the Licensed Mark in a manner they reasonably believe to be acceptable. Licensed Users should strive to avoid actions that clearly and directly damage the Licensor's rights in the Licensed Mark.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with 'sound trademark practice' and avoids actions that 'interfere with, diminish or tarnish' trademark rights. The modified text replaces these clear obligations with vague suggestions ('endeavor,' 'reasonably believe,' 'strive,' 'clearly and directly'). This introduces ambiguity, making enforcement difficult.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 1114) - Specifically, Section 32, which protects trademark owners against uses that are likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. The changes weaken the obligation to protect against infringement.",

                "explanation": "The original text creates a mandatory notification obligation. The modified text makes notification discretionary and dependent on the Licensed Users' subjective judgment of significance. This ambiguity undermines the Licensor's ability to protect its trademark effectively.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 1114) - By making the reporting of potential infringements discretionary, the altered text reduces the likelihood that infringing uses will be detected and addressed in a timely manner. This hinders the trademark owner's ability to protect its brand and enforce its rights, undermining the fundamental goals of the Lanham Act.",

Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' own expense, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, expense or liability (including attorneys' fees and costs), to the extent that the foregoing (a) is based on a claim resulting solely from any service provided or offered by Licensed Users, (b) results from a material breach, or is based on a claim that, if true, would be a material breach, of this Agreement by Licensed Users, or (c) is based upon Licensed Users' unauthorized or improper use of the Licensed Mark.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 Indemnification. Licensed Users will consider indemnifying Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against claims, demands, causes of action, debts, expenses, or liabilities, only if there is undeniable evidence directly linking the claim to (a) services solely provided or offered by Licensed Users, (b) a clearly established material breach of this Agreement by Licensed Users, or (c) a demonstrably unauthorized and grossly improper use of the Licensed Mark.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates indemnification under specific circumstances. The modified text introduces multiple layers of ambiguity and subjective judgment ('consider,' 'undeniable evidence,' 'clearly established,' 'demonstrably unauthorized,' 'grossly improper'). This significantly weakens the indemnification obligation and makes it difficult to enforce, potentially leaving the Licensor unprotected.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law Principles (California): The changes undermine the fundamental principle of contractual obligations and good faith. The modified clause allows the Licensee to avoid indemnification by setting an unreasonably high bar for evidence and linking to specific legal elements, effectively negating the indemnification provision and undermining the licensor's ability to be protected against trademark misuse.",

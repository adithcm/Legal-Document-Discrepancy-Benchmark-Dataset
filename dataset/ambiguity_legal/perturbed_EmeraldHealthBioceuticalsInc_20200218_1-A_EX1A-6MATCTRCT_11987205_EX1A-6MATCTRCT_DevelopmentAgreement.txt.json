                "original_text": "EHS and EHN shall have the exclusive rights in and to all ingredients, product specifications, goodwill, and all other intellectual property rights associated with any Product(s); provided, however, that EHS and EHN shall not have any rights in or to Dr. Murray's name or likeness except as expressly granted in writing herein or via electronic transmission by Dr. Murray.",
                "changed_text": "EHS and EHN shall have broad rights to ingredients, product specifications, goodwill, and other intellectual property associated with any Product(s); provided, however, that the use of Dr. Murray's name or likeness on its products or product marketing materials will be considered with reasonable discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces \"exclusive rights\" with \"broad rights,\" which is less definitive, and the usage of Dr. Murrayâ€™s name or likeness is now subject to a vague standard of 'reasonable discretion' rather than explicit written consent. This introduces ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Right of Publicity laws, generally applicable across states, require explicit consent for the commercial use of a person's name or likeness.",

The Dr. Murray Products will be listed on Schedule A attached hereto as they are developed and added to product portfolio. During each year of this agreement, Dr. Murray will be paid no later than the 30st day of January based on the cumulative Net Sales of the Dr. Murray Products for the preceding 12 months based upon the following scale:",
                "changed_text": "Dr. Murray may receive royalties on net sales for products possibly developed by Dr. Murray for EHN, subject to EHN's discretion. Products may or may not be listed on Schedule A. During each year of this agreement, Dr. Murray will attempt to be paid around January, give or take, based on a rough estimate of net sales.",
                "explanation": "The words 'will' and 'shall' are replaced with 'may' and less definitive words like 'possibly', 'around', and 'rough estimate'. This introduces ambiguity regarding whether the royalty will be paid and how it will be calculated.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - the original text defines a clear obligation to pay royalties based on a defined schedule, while the modified text makes this obligation uncertain and unenforceable.",

Confidential Information may include what is considered proprietary information, possibly encompassing technical data, potentially trade secrets or know-how, maybe including the terms and conditions of this Agreement, sort of like research, and maybe product plans.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the confidentiality clause by using less definite language such as 'endeavor not to,' 'perceive to be,' 'feel is necessary,' 'may include,' 'possibly,' 'potentially,' and 'maybe.' This makes the obligation to protect confidential information uncertain and undermines the definition of what constitutes confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade Secret Laws (Uniform Trade Secrets Act) - The original language provides clear protection for trade secrets, while the modified language weakens this protection through ambiguity, making it more difficult to prove misappropriation.",

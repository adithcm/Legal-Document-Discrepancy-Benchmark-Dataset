                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "This Agreement, including its attachment and order acknowledgments under the Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between Distributor and NETGEAR with respect to the purchase, resale and distribution of the Products and is governed by the laws of the State of California except that body of law dealing with conflicts of law.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement, including its attachment and order acknowledgments under the Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between Distributor and NETGEAR with respect to the purchase, resale and distribution of the Products and is generally guided by the laws of the State of California, but specific interpretations may vary.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'generally guided' and 'specific interpretations may vary' introduces ambiguity regarding the governing law. While the original text clearly states California law governs, the modified version suggests flexibility in interpretation, potentially conflicting with established California contract law principles.",

                "original_text": "Distributor agrees that the foregoing Discount is only applicable to Products included on the NETGEAR Price List on the Effective Date of this Agreement. NETGEAR reserves the right to add Products to the Price List at its sole discretion and any such additional Products shall be offered to Distributor at discounts to be determined at that time.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor agrees that the foregoing Discount is only applicable to Products included on the NETGEAR Price List on the Effective Date of this Agreement. NETGEAR may add Products to the Price List as it sees fit, and additional Products may be offered to Distributor with discounts that are subject to change.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'reserves the right to' to 'may add' introduces uncertainty about NETGEAR's obligation to even add products. More critically, replacing 'discounts to be determined at that time' with 'discounts that are subject to change' gives NETGEAR broad discretion to alter discounts without any specified parameters, conflicting with California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date, Distributor should ideally be the primary distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*], pending Distributor's engagement in collaborative marketing activities. A general Marketing Plan for [*] might be developed and discussed.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be' with 'should ideally be', 'subject to' with 'pending', and 'mutually agreed to marketing activities... to be developed and agreed to' with 'collaborative marketing activities' and 'general Marketing Plan... might be developed and discussed' weakens the exclusivity and commitment to a defined marketing plan. This potentially undermines the distributor's exclusive rights and introduces ambiguity around the marketing obligations, creating a situation that might not be enforceable under contract law, especially if a clearly defined marketing plan (Exhibit 4a) never materializes.",

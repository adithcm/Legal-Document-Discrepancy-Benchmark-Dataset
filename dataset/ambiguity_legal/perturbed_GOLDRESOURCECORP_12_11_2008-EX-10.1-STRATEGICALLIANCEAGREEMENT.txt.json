                "original_text": "The Company shall comply with all securities regulatory filing requirements on a timely basis in connection with the issuance of any Equity Securities of the Company to any HOC Entity, including filing within the periods stipulated under Securities Laws, at the Company's expense, all private placement forms required to be filed by the Company and paying all filing fees required to be paid in connection therewith so that such issuance may lawfully occur without the necessity of filing a prospectus, registration statement or any similar document under the Securities Laws.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall endeavor to comply with securities regulatory filing requirements in a generally timely manner in connection with the issuance of any Equity Securities of the Company to any HOC Entity, including filing private placement forms as it deems necessary and paying filing fees to the extent practicable, so that such issuance may occur without undue delay.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply,' making compliance discretionary. The terms 'generally timely manner,' 'as it deems necessary,' and 'to the extent practicable' are vague and undermine the strict requirements of securities regulations. This language weakens the obligation to adhere to stipulated periods under Securities Laws.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall, to the extent and for so long as HOC Entities hold at least 14.5% of the Shares on a non-diluted basis, upon HOC's request, permit representatives of the HOC Entities to have access to the site and any of the premises where the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries are conducted and access and duplicating rights (and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause persons or firms possessing such documentation or information to give similar access and duplicating rights) to the Company and its Subsidiaries' books of account and records and such other documents, communications, items and matters, within the knowledge, possession or control of the Company, which HOC may reasonably request, at HOC's own cost (other than those it is permitted to examine and make copies of free of charge pursuant to applicable Laws) provided that, except to the extent the information can be provided in the necessary course of business of the Company, acting reasonably including to provide HOC Entities with information to assist the HOC Entities and their advisors with the preparation of the financial statements for such HOC Entities, nothing herein shall require the Company to provide HOC Entities with any information which would constitute a material fact with respect to the Company which has not been generally disclosed.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will consider permitting representatives of the HOC Entities to have some access to the site and premises where the business operates, and may provide some access and duplicating rights to the Company’s books and records as it deems appropriate, if HOC requests it and holds at least 14.5% of the Shares. However, the Company is not required to disclose any confidential information.",
                "explanation": "The altered text weakens the obligation of the company to provide access to information. By replacing 'shall permit' with 'will consider permitting,' and introducing terms like 'some access' and 'as it deems appropriate,' the provision becomes vague and discretionary. The addition of 'is not required to disclose any confidential information' is overly broad and could be used to withhold information that HOC is legally entitled to access under the original agreement, creating an ambiguity. This impacts HOC's rights to information",

Such Registration Statement also shall cover, to the extent allowable under the 1933 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder (including Rule 416), such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common Stock resulting from stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions with respect to the Shares. The Company shall pay all expenses associated with the registration, including filing and printing fees, counsel and accounting fees and expenses, and State \"Blue Sky\" fees and expenses. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable. The Company shall notify HOC by facsimile or e-mail as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within three (3) business days, after the Registration Statement is declared effective and shall simultaneously provide HOC with copies of any related prospectus to be used in connection with the sale or other disposition of the securities covered thereby.",
                "changed_text": "If the Company arguably breaches any representation, warranty, covenant, or right of HOC under this Agreement, then at HOC’s request, the Company might consider filing a registration statement with the SEC, as reasonably determined by the Company. If Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 allows the sale of all the Shares, the Company may, at its discretion, assist HOC with the sale under Rule 144. The Company will try to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC. The Company will attempt to notify HOC within a reasonable time after it's declared effective.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces mandatory actions with discretionary ones, weakening the Company's obligations. 'Arguably breaches' introduces uncertainty about what constitutes a breach. 'Might consider' and 'as reasonably determined by the Company' make the filing of a registration statement optional. Replacing 'shall use its commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will try' weakens the commitment to have the Registration Statement declared effective. 'Attempt to notify' replaces a concrete deadline with an ambiguous one. The language makes it unclear when and if the Company is actually required to act, creating ambiguity that contradicts the requirements for registration under the Securities Act.",

                "changed_text": "EmployeeCo agrees to generally provide the Services to the Operating Company and its affiliates, subject to resource availability and internal priorities.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'provide the Services' to 'generally provide...subject to resource availability and internal priorities' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear what level of service is actually guaranteed. The addition of 'subject to resource availability and internal priorities' makes the obligation to provide services discretionary, allowing EmployeeCo to potentially under-deliver without clear recourse for the Operating Company.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Operating Company shall reimburse EmployeeCo for all direct or indirect costs and expenses incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) salaries of the Services Employees;\n\n(b) the cost of employee benefits for the Services Employees, including 401(k), pension, bonuses and health insurance benefits (whether through insurance policies provided by third-parties or self-insurance);\n\n(c) costs associated with workers' compensation claims and other disputes or liabilities associated with the Services Employees;\n\n(d) severance costs with respect to any terminated Services Employees; and\n\n(e) all sales, use, employment, excise, value added or similar taxes, if any, that may be applicable from time to time with respect to the Services.",
                "changed_text": "The Operating Company will endeavor to reimburse EmployeeCo for costs and expenses related to performing obligations, which may include:\n\n(a) Salaries of Services Employees, as reasonably determined by EmployeeCo;\n\n(b) Employee benefits, potentially including 401(k), pension, bonuses, and health insurance;\n\n(c) Costs related to worker's compensation, subject to further negotiation;\n\n(d) Severance, if deemed necessary by EmployeeCo; and\n\n(e) Applicable taxes, as estimated by EmployeeCo.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall reimburse' to 'will endeavor to reimburse' significantly weakens the obligation. Adding qualifiers like 'as reasonably determined,' 'potentially including,' 'subject to further negotiation,' 'if deemed necessary,' and 'as estimated' introduces ambiguity regarding the types and amounts of reimbursements, making it difficult to enforce a specific reimbursement amount or type. This can allow EmployeeCo to avoid reimbursing certain costs, leading to disputes.",

Each Party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Colorado and to venue in Denver, Colorado.",

Each party may be open to consider the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Colorado and to venue in Denver, Colorado.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Colorado' to 'will generally be interpreted in accordance with the spirit of Colorado law' introduces ambiguity by replacing a clear legal standard with a vague notion of 'spirit.' The addition of 'with the Parties open to considering alternative dispute resolution methods as they see fit' makes the choice of law less certain. Also, replacing 'Each Party hereby submits' with 'Each party may be open to consider' introduces ambiguity to the forum selection clause",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Colorado contract law requires clear and unambiguous language for enforceability. Using the 'spirit' of the law is too vague. Also, forum selection clauses must be clear and mandatory.",

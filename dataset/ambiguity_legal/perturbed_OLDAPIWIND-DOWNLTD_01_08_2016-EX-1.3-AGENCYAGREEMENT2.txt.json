                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "(ii) all offers of Securities by us in the United States have been effected by the U.S. Affiliate in accordance with all applicable U.S. federal and state broker-dealer requirements;",
                "changed_text": "(ii) all offers of Securities by us in the United States have been effected by the U.S. Affiliate with the intention of complying with U.S. federal and state broker-dealer requirements;",
                "explanation": "Changing 'in accordance with' to 'with the intention of complying' introduces ambiguity. It suggests that the U.S. Affiliate only needs to have the intention of compliance, rather than actual compliance, which weakens the obligation. This makes enforcement difficult as proving 'intention' is subjective.",

                "changed_text": "(iii) immediately prior to offering the Securities to persons in the United States, we believed that each such person was likely an Accredited Investor, and, on the date hereof, we generally believe that each such offeree purchasing Securities from the Corporation is probably an Accredited Investor;",
                "explanation": "Changing 'reasonable grounds to believe and did believe' to 'believed that each such person was likely' weakens the certainty required for verifying accredited investor status. Also, changing 'continue to believe' to 'generally believe that each such offeree purchasing Securities from the Corporation is probably an Accredited Investor' introduces uncertainty about whether the investors met the requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Rule 506(b) of Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act, which requires reasonable steps to verify accredited investor status and prohibits sales to non-accredited investors.",

                "explanation": "Adding phrases like 'to our knowledge', 'knowingly', and 'intentionally' introduces subjective qualifiers. It suggests that unintentional violations or violations they were unaware of are acceptable, weakening the obligation to avoid directed selling efforts, general solicitation or general advertising.",

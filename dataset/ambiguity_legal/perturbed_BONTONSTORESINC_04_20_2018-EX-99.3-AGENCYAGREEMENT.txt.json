                "original_text": "Agent shall be responsible for allocating and designating the shipment of Merchandise from Merchant's Distribution Centers to the Stores. All costs and expenses of operating the Distribution Centers, including, but not limited to, use and occupancy expenses, Distribution Center employee payroll and other obligations, and/or processing, transferring, consolidating, shipping, and/or delivering goods within or from the Distribution Centers (the \"Distribution Center Expenses\"), shall be borne by Agent as an Expense except to the extent provided for in the Wind-Down Budget.",
                "changed_text": "Agent will generally oversee the shipment of Merchandise from Merchant's Distribution Centers to the Stores. Most costs and expenses of operating the Distribution Centers, possibly including use and occupancy expenses, Distribution Center employee payroll and other obligations, and/or processing, transferring, consolidating, shipping, and/or delivering goods within or from the Distribution Centers (the \"Distribution Center Expenses\"), may be borne by Agent as an Expense as provided for in the Wind-Down Budget.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity regarding Agent's responsibility for Distribution Center expenses. Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'will generally oversee' makes the oversight role less definitive. The change from 'shall be borne by Agent as an Expense' to 'may be borne by Agent as an Expense as provided for in the Wind-Down Budget' makes the payment of these expenses discretionary and dependent on the Wind-Down Budget, rather than a firm obligation. The term 'possibly including' adds further ambiguity as to which expenses are covered, creating uncertainty. This lack of clarity and definiteness creates ambiguity that could contradict labor and safety laws.",

                "original_text": "Subject to the Wind-Down Budget, Merchant shall, throughout the Sale Term, maintain in good working order, condition, and repair all cash registers, heating systems, air conditioning systems, elevators, escalators and all other mechanical devices necessary or appropriate for the conduct of the Sale at the Stores.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the Wind-Down Budget, Merchant shall endeavor to maintain, to the extent feasible, the functioning of essential equipment such as cash registers, and perhaps heating systems, air conditioning systems, and other devices reasonably deemed necessary for the Sale at the Stores.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the obligation to maintain essential equipment. Changing 'maintain in good working order, condition, and repair' to 'endeavor to maintain, to the extent feasible, the functioning of essential equipment' introduces a high degree of ambiguity and discretion. The addition of 'perhaps' before 'heating systems, air conditioning systems' and 'reasonably deemed necessary' further weakens the obligation, making it unclear what equipment must be maintained, and who is responsible for what to be deemed 'reasonably necessary'. This is ambiguous and vague and could violate employee safety laws.",

                "changed_text": "Agent shall generally conduct the GOB Sale in the name of and on behalf of Merchant, attempting to maintain a commercially reasonable approach, while considering the terms of this Agreement and the Approval Order.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the standard of conduct for the GOB Sale by replacing 'shall conduct...in a commercially reasonable manner and in compliance with' with 'shall generally conduct...attempting to maintain a commercially reasonable approach, while considering.' This makes the obligation to act in a commercially reasonable manner less strict and compliance with the Agreement and Approval Order not guaranteed. The insertion of 'attempting' introduces ambiguity, making it unclear what level of effort is required to comply with the terms of the contract. The ambiguous wording could violate consumer protection and advertising laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state consumer protection laws and advertising regulations, which require clear and honest business practices.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"competitive retailer\" means an on-line department store comparable to Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Burdine's, Shopping.com, Chef's Catalog or iQVC.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"good faith ensure\" to \"use reasonable efforts\" weakens the obligation. The change in the definition of \"competitive retailer\" gives Excite too much discretion, potentially harming the client. This introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation less enforceable.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"will provide\" with \"will endeavor to provide\" makes the provision of user data non-mandatory. Removing the 30-day deadline and \"mutually-determined electronic format\" introduces significant vagueness, allowing Client to potentially delay or withhold User Data.",

Replacing \"will promptly notify\" with \"will attempt to notify\" and \"will reasonably cooperate\" with \"may cooperate\" further reduces Excite's protection, creating significant ambiguity and making the indemnification clause nearly unenforceable. This contradicts the basic principle of contractual indemnification.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract law; specifically invalidates the indemnification clause, rendering it ineffective and leaving Excite without its bargained-for protection. The contract refers to New York Law in 16(b) and this change would be a failure of good faith and fair dealing.",

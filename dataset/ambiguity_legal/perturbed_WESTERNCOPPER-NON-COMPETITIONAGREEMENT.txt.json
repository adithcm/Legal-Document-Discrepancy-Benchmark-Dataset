                "original_text": "Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period of 2 years after the Effective Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any Person, which will include being a principal, agent, shareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever, (a) carry on or be engaged in Mining Activities, or i 162967.3 -4- (b) advise, lend money to, guarantee the debts or obligations of or permit its name to be used by any Person who carries on or is engaged in Mining Activities, in the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "changed_text": "Western Copper will endeavor to avoid competing with Glamis for a period of 2 years after the Effective Date. Western Copper will consider, but is not obligated to prevent, any person from being a principal, agent, shareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever, (a) carrying on or being engaged in Mining Activities, or (b) advising, lending money to, guaranteeing the debts or obligations of or permitting its name to be used by any Person who carries on or is engaged in Mining Activities, in the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'covenants and agrees that it will not' with 'will endeavor to avoid competing' weakens the obligation. The original clause creates a clear prohibition on competition, while the modified clause introduces a weaker obligation. Also replacing 'will not, directly or indirectly prevent' with 'consider, but is not obligated to prevent' creates ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "Glamis covenants and agrees with Western Copper that if at any time it intends to dispose of a Designated Mineral Property for cash consideration or by abandonment, it will give Western Copper notice (the ' Disposition Notice\") of the intended disposition. For a period of 30 days from the time of delivery of the Disposition Notice Glamis will, if requested by Western Silver, entertain an offer from Western Copper to acquire the Designated Mineral Property. In the ease of a Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to dispose of for cash consideration, the parties will negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable agreement for the sale to Western Copper of the [Designated Mineral Property. If Glamis and Western Copper are unable to negotiate an acceptable agreement with respect to the Designated Mineral Property within the 30 day period, Glamis may thereafter dispose of the Designated Mineral Property as it sees til in its absolute discretion.",
                "changed_text": "Glamis shall make reasonable attempts to notify Western Copper if it considers disposing of a Designated Mineral Property for cash consideration or by abandonment. Glamis may, at its discretion, entertain an offer from Western Copper to acquire the Designated Mineral Property. The parties will attempt to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable agreement for the sale to Western Copper of the Designated Mineral Property. If the parties are unable to negotiate an agreement, Glamis can dispose of the Designated Mineral Property as it reasonably deems fit.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'it will give Western Copper notice' with 'shall make reasonable attempts to notify' introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation to provide notice. Similarly, 'Glamis will... entertain an offer' is changed to 'Glamis may, at its discretion, entertain an offer,' weakening the commitment. Lastly, changing 'as it sees fit in its absolute discretion' to 'as it reasonably deems fit' introduces ambiguity that could be challenged.",

                "changed_text": "Each of the parties hereto generally agrees that some of their covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder could extend to their respective subsidiaries and other Affiliates, as well as against the parties themselves. The names of Glamis and Western Copper might be deemed to refer collectively to Glamis and all of its subsidiaries and other Affiliates and to Western Copper and all of its subsidiaries and other Affiliates, respectively.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'all of their covenants, agreements and obligations... shall extend to and be binding upon' to 'some of their covenants, agreements and obligations... could extend to', the provision becomes ambiguous about which obligations apply to subsidiaries. The use of 'generally agrees' and 'might be deemed' further weakens the binding nature of the agreement on subsidiaries.",

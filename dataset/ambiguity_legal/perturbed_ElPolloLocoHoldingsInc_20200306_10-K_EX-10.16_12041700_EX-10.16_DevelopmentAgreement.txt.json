                "original_text": "Developer shall use its best efforts to retain qualified real estate professionals (including licensed brokers) to locate proposed sites for the El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s). Developer shall submit proposed sites for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant unit to be developed under this Agreement for acceptance by Franchisor's Real Estate Site Approval Committee (\"RESAC\"), together with such site information as may be reasonably required by Franchisor to evaluate the proposed site, no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\" as RESAC Submittal Dates, the first of which shall be approximately ninety (90) days after execution of this Agreement. Should the site be accepted by RESAC, it will be referred to as the \"Approved Site\". Such acceptance will expire one (1) year from the RESAC approval date. Franchisor may require, as a condition to its approval of a site, a \"Market Study\", which shall include a site description and analysis, traffic and other demographic information and an analysis of the impact of the proposed site on other company owned and franchised El Pollo Loco restaurants surrounding or within the vicinity of such proposed site all in such format as the Franchisor may require. All such analyses, information and studies shall be prepared at the sole cost and expense of Developer.",
                "changed_text": "Developer shall endeavor to retain real estate professionals to locate proposed sites for the El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s). Developer shall attempt to submit proposed sites for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant unit to be developed under this Agreement for consideration by Franchisor's Real Estate Site Approval Committee (\"RESAC\"), along with such site information as the Franchisor might find useful. There is no guaranteed time that the site will be approved by RESAC, it might be referred to as the \"Approved Site\" if the Franchisor decides to approve. Franchisor can request, as a condition to its approval of a site, a \"Market Study\", which shall vaguely include a site description and analysis, traffic and other demographic information with no specifics, and a summary of the impact of the proposed site on other company owned and franchised El Pollo Loco restaurants. All such analyses, information and studies shall be prepared at the sole cost and expense of Developer.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguity by weakening the obligation to use 'best efforts' to 'endeavor,' and changing mandatory 'acceptance' to 'consideration.' Removing the deadlines and specific requirements for the 'Market Study' further reduces the obligation's enforceability. The vague description of the Market Study makes it unenforceable. This transformation of 'shall' to conditional phrases weakens the obligation.",

                "original_text": "Each subsequent site to be developed pursuant to the Development Schedule shall be submitted for approval by RESAC by the date set forth in Exhibit \"B\". Similarly, each fully executed lease (executed upon prior review and approval by Franchisor) or purchase agreement (with all contingencies to Developer's obligations waived or satisfied, except permitting contingencies) relating to each subsequent Approved Site shall: (1) be delivered to Franchisor on or before the Site Commitment Date for each respective El Pollo Loco® Restaurant as set forth in Exhibit \"B\" and (2) prior to the execution of your Franchise Agreements (3) prior to the payment of your initial Franchise Fees for each site and (4) prior to the commencement of construction of the El Pollo Loco® Restaurant.",
                "changed_text": "Each subsequent site to be developed according to the Development Schedule might be submitted for approval by RESAC around the date stated in Exhibit \"B\". Similarly, each lease or purchase agreement concerning each subsequent Approved Site should be delivered to Franchisor and prior to the execution of your Franchise Agreements, prior to the payment of your initial Franchise Fees for each site, and prior to the commencement of construction of the El Pollo Loco® Restaurant.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'might be' and 'should be' introduces ambiguity and makes the submission and delivery requirements non-mandatory. The clause 'around the date stated' replaces specific deadlines with an indefinite timeframe, further weakening the obligation. Removing the phrase 'executed upon prior review and approval by Franchisor' removes a specific review requirement for the Fully Executed Lease, thus making it unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "In the event of third party claims of the right to develop the Territory, it is the sole responsibility of El Pollo Loco, where the right granted herein is exclusive, to protect and maintain Developer's right to the development of the Territory. However, if it appears to El Pollo Loco, as its sole and absolute right to determine, that protection of the Territory by legal action is not advisable, whether due to the anticipation of, or the actual protracted nature of the action, the costs involved, the uncertainty of outcome, or otherwise, Franchisor has the right to terminate this Agreement, provided that it refunds to Developer the balance, if any, of the Development Fee made pursuant to Section 3, which has not been applied against the initial franchise fees for Franchise Agreement(s) to be acquired under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of third party claims of the right to develop the Territory, El Pollo Loco will consider protecting and maintaining Developer's right to the development of the Territory. However, El Pollo Loco has the right to terminate this Agreement, provided that it refunds to Developer the balance of the Development Fee made pursuant to Section 3.",
                "explanation": "The change makes El Pollo Loco's obligation to protect the territory non-mandatory by replacing 'it is the sole responsibility' with 'El Pollo Loco will consider.' Removing the conditions under which Franchisor could terminate weakens the franchisor's responsibility to engage in the legal action. Replacing 'if any' with a non-conditional tone to pay the Development Fee.",

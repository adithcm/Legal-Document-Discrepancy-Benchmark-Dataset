                "original_text": "Buyer Affiliates shall issue a purchase order(s), or call off order(s) when purchasing Product from ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates in writing pursuant to this Contract (\"Purchase Order\"). Such Purchase Order(s) shall specify (a) the quantity of Product, and (b) general date of delivery. All Purchase Orders agreed to be filled by an ExxonMobil Selling affiliate shall be deemed to be a separate agreement between the relevant ExxonMobil Selling Affiliate and the relevant Buyer Affiliate, incorporating the terms of this Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the attachments ExxonMobil and the ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates shall not unreasonably reject any Purchase Order that otherwise complies with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Buyer Affiliates should endeavor to issue a purchase order(s), or call off order(s) when purchasing Product from ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates in writing pursuant to this Contract (\"Purchase Order\"). Such Purchase Order(s) may specify (a) the approximate quantity of Product, and (b) estimated date of delivery. Purchase Orders filled by an ExxonMobil Selling affiliate shall be considered a separate agreement between the relevant ExxonMobil Selling Affiliate and the relevant Buyer Affiliate, incorporating the terms of this Contract. ExxonMobil and the ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates may reject any Purchase Order.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall issue' to 'should endeavor' and 'shall specify' to 'may specify' weakens the obligation on the buyer to provide firm purchase orders with specific details. Removing the 'not unreasonably reject' clause gives ExxonMobil the right to reject any purchase order without cause, which potentially contradicts contract law principles that require good faith in commercial agreements.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains a definite timeline and a 'good faith' obligation to assess adjustments. The modified text makes the meeting optional ('may meet'), indefinite ('sometime around'), and discretionary ('if they find it convenient'). This removes the binding nature of the original clause and weakens the commitment to negotiate prices in good faith. The 'good faith' obligation is removed.",

                "changed_text": "Buyer/Buyer Affiliates are generally responsible for the Product and returnable crates in their custody. The specifics of responsibility relating to the use and return of metal crates are vaguely outlined in Attachment F.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'are responsible...at the sales value' to 'are generally responsible' and 'terms...are set out' to 'specifics...are vaguely outlined' introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of the buyer's responsibility for the product and crates. Removing the clear financial valuation creates a dispute over what constitutes 'general responsibility.' This weakens the enforceability of the return obligation outlined in Attachment F and conflicts with contract law needing clear obligations.",

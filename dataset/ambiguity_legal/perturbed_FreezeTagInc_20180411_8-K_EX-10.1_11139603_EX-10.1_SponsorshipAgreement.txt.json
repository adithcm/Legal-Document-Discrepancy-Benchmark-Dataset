                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'in accordance with all applicable laws' with 'while generally adhering to applicable laws,' making compliance discretionary. The phrase 'using its best judgment regarding standards of decorum and taste' introduces subjectivity, undermining the original obligation to adhere to clear, objective standards. This weakens the enforceable nature of the clause.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with a Best's rating of A+. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 30 days' notice for cancellation of policy and 10 days' notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company will attempt to obtain and maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage. The Association should be a named additional insured, and reasonable notice should be provided for cancellation of policy and non-payment of premium. The specific requirements and amounts of insurance coverage may be adjusted by the Company as deemed necessary.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the clear obligation to obtain specific insurance coverage. Replacing 'shall obtain and maintain' with 'will attempt to obtain and maintain' makes the requirement discretionary. The phrase 'should be a named additional insured' weakens the obligation. The provision that 'The specific requirements and amounts of insurance coverage may be adjusted by the Company as deemed necessary' introduces a unilateral right for the Company to alter the insurance requirements, creating ambiguity and potentially leaving the Association under-insured, contradicting basic insurance contract principles and potentially violating fiduciary duties.",

Both Parties will consider taking steps to protect against infringement of the Association Marks. Each Party may offer assistance to the other in protecting the Association Marks if convenient. Each Party will attempt to notify the other if it suspects any potential infringement of the Association Marks or Company.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to protect intellectual property. 'Shall take measures it deems necessary' is replaced with 'will endeavor to take measures it believes are sufficient', reducing the standard of care. 'Protect against infringement' becomes 'consider taking steps to protect against infringement,' making it optional. 'Reasonable assistance' becomes 'may offer assistance if convenient,' and 'notify immediately' becomes 'attempt to notify if suspects,' further weakening the obligation and contradicting fundamental principles of trademark law, which requires proactive protection of trademarks. The phrases 'obviously violate' and 'clear right' introduce further ambiguity as to the standard of protection.",

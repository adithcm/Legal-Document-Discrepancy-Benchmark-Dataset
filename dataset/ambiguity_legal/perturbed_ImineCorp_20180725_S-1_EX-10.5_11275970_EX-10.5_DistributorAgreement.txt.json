                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "3.1 Market Promotion. The Distributor shall use its best efforts, consistent with prudent business practice, and shall devote such time as may be commercially reasonably necessary, to conduct an aggressive marketing and selling program and to promote the sale of the Products.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 Market Promotion. The Distributor shall endeavor to promote the sale of the Products as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"use its best efforts\" with \"endeavor to promote\" and removing the requirements of a consistent, aggressive marketing program weakens the obligation. The phrase \"as it deems appropriate\" introduces significant ambiguity, making the marketing effort discretionary rather than mandatory. This can lead to insufficient marketing, impacting sales and contradicting the implied obligation to actively promote the products.",
                "contradicted_law": "Taiwanese Fair Trade Act - Article 20, which prohibits enterprises from impeding fair competition, including the obligation to genuinely promote distributed goods.",

The Distributor shall comply at its own expense with all applicable laws and regulations currently existing in Taiwan relating to the sale, distribution and promotion of the Products. Distributor shall not export, directly or indirectly, any Products or related information outside of Taiwan.",
                "changed_text": "3.5 Compliance with Laws. The Distributor will generally adhere to applicable laws and regulations in Taiwan relating to the sale, distribution and promotion of the Products. The Distributor will try to avoid exporting, directly or indirectly, any Products or related information outside of Taiwan.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"shall comply\" to \"will generally adhere to\" weakens the binding nature of the legal compliance obligation. Adding \"try to avoid\" instead of \"shall not export\" makes the prohibition of exporting ambiguous and non-committal. This could lead to a breach of Taiwanese export regulations.",

At a minimum, such inventory shall include not less than the quantity of Products necessary to meet Distributor's reasonably anticipated demands for a thirty (30) day period.",
                "changed_text": "3.8 Inventory. The Distributor should attempt to keep some inventory of Products. The amount of inventory is up to the discretion of the distributor.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall maintain\" with \"should attempt to keep some\" introduces ambiguity and lowers the standard of care. Removing the reasonably sufficient quantities and thirty-day minimum criteria makes the inventory obligation completely discretionary and unenforceable. This could lead to inadequate inventory levels and failure to meet customer demands.",

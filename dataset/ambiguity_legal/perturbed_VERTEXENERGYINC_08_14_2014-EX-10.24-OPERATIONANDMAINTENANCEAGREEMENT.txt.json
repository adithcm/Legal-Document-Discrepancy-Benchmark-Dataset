                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation. This implies that Operator only needs to make an effort, potentially not achieving full compliance with environmental regulations. This ambiguity introduces a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be responsible' to 'will attempt to' and replacing 'required by any Governmental Authority' with 'as it deems necessary' weakens the obligation. This allows Operator to decide which filings are necessary, potentially omitting required submissions and violating regulations.",

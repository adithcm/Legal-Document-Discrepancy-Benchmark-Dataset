                "original_text": "Each Party agrees that to the extent such Party is the beneficiary of a Future Affiliate Provision, such Party hereby waives and disclaims, and will not seek to enforce or claim the benefit of, such Future Affiliate Provision, such waiver, disclaimer and covenant being for the sole benefit of the other Parties, their Party Groups, and their future Affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may consider waiving a Future Affiliate Provision to the extent it deems appropriate; however, such waiver is not guaranteed and depends on various factors.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear obligation to waive Future Affiliate Provisions. The modified text introduces ambiguity and discretion, replacing 'agrees' with 'may consider' and adding subjective criteria ('to the extent it deems appropriate', 'not guaranteed'). This creates uncertainty about the actual obligation, which weakens the enforceability of the original clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Enforceability of Contracts. Ambiguous terms can render a contract provision unenforceable due to lack of mutual assent or definiteness.",

                "changed_text": "Otis and Carrier may, at their convenience, assist UTC in protecting its United Technologies Trademarks, as long as it doesn't significantly impact their own business operations.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces a clear and mandatory obligation ('agree and promise to assist') with a discretionary one ('may assist'). The added condition about not significantly impacting their own business operations introduces further ambiguity and allows Otis and Carrier to potentially avoid their obligation based on a subjective assessment of impact.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark Law - Duty to Protect Trademarks. While not a direct violation, weakening the obligation to assist in protecting trademarks can indirectly undermine UTC's ability to enforce its trademark rights, potentially conflicting with trademark law principles.",

Neither a Licensor Party nor any member of the Licensor Group will have any rights to any such improvements, and as between a Licensee Party and a Licensor Party, the Licensee Party or applicable member of the Licensee Group will own all such improvements made by the Licensee Party or such member of the Licensee Group to Licensed Intellectual Property Rights.",

The ownership of such improvements will be determined on a case-by-case basis based on contribution.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the licensee has the right to make improvements, and owns any such improvements. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'includes the right' to 'includes the possible right to attempt', making the right to improve uncertain. Furthermore, it replaces the clear ownership rule with a vague 'case-by-case basis based on contribution' standard, creating uncertainty about who owns the improvements. This could discourage innovation and lead to disputes.",

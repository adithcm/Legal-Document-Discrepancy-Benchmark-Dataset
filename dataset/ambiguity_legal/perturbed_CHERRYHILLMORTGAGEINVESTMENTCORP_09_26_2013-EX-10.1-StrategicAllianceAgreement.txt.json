                "original_text": "Freedom Mortgage agrees that if a Standby Issuer (as defined in the Acknowledgement Agreement) has not yet been appointed, upon the occurrence of a Standby Trigger Event, it shall designate a Standby Issuer reasonably satisfactory to Cherry Hill and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Standby Issuer to agree to act as such and to be accepted by Ginnie Mae as the Standby Issuer referred to in the Acknowledgement Agreement. Any costs or expenses incurred in connection with such designation, agreement and/or approval shall be paid by Freedom Mortgage.",
                "changed_text": "Freedom Mortgage agrees that if a Standby Issuer (as defined in the Acknowledgement Agreement) has not yet been appointed, upon the occurrence of a Standby Trigger Event, it may designate a Standby Issuer somewhat satisfactory to Cherry Hill and should attempt to cause such Standby Issuer to generally agree to act as such and to be accepted by Ginnie Mae as the Standby Issuer referred to in the Acknowledgement Agreement. Any costs or expenses incurred in connection with such designation, agreement and/or approval may be paid by Freedom Mortgage.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on Freedom Mortgage to designate a Standby Issuer that is 'reasonably satisfactory' and to use 'commercially reasonable efforts' to secure their agreement and Ginnie Mae's acceptance. The revised text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall designate' to 'may designate', 'reasonably satisfactory' to 'somewhat satisfactory', 'shall use' to 'should attempt', and 'shall be paid' to 'may be paid', making the action discretionary and the standard subjective. This weakens the commitment and introduces uncertainty about Freedom Mortgage's responsibility.",
                "contradicted_law": "Ginnie Mae guidelines require specific procedures for standby issuers and servicers, and this change introduces ambiguity that could conflict with the clarity and enforceability required by those guidelines. While Ginnie Mae is a federal entity, the failure to adhere to their servicing guidelines can have material impacts and is taken seriously. In New York, where the contract is governed, parties are expected to act in good faith, and this ambiguity raises concerns of potential bad faith due to the vagueness of the obligations.",

                "original_text": "Cherry Hill agrees that upon the request of Freedom Mortgage, Cherry Hill shall cooperate with Freedom Mortgage's efforts to cause the Acknowledgement Agreement to be revised or replaced with an alternative arrangement proposed by Freedom Mortgage that is acceptable to Ginnie Mae and that will provide Cherry Hill with benefits, rights and remedies that are, in the reasonable judgment of Cherry Hill, not materially less favorable than those provided under the Acknowledgement Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Cherry Hill agrees that upon the request of Freedom Mortgage, Cherry Hill might cooperate with Freedom Mortgage's efforts to perhaps cause the Acknowledgement Agreement to be revised or replaced with an alternative arrangement proposed by Freedom Mortgage that is acceptable to Ginnie Mae and that will provide Cherry Hill with benefits, rights and remedies that are, in Cherry Hillâ€™s opinion, more or less comparable to those provided under the Acknowledgement Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall cooperate,' indicating a firm commitment. The modified text replaces it with 'might cooperate' and replace 'cause' with 'perhaps cause' which makes the cooperation optional and the effort to revise or replace the agreement uncertain. Furthermore, changing 'reasonable judgement of Cherry Hill, not materially less favorable' to 'Cherry Hill's opinion, more or less comparable' introduces subjectivity and weakens the standard for the alternative arrangement's acceptability.",
                "contradicted_law": "This modification introduces ambiguity regarding Cherry Hill's obligations, potentially conflicting with the principle of good faith and fair dealing implied in New York contract law. The lack of a clear standard for what constitutes 'more or less comparable' benefits could lead to disputes and render the clause unenforceable, especially if Cherry Hill unreasonably withholds cooperation.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement and the Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement could for some reason be seen as invalid, illegal or unenforceable in some way, by some court, such potential invalidity, illegality or unenforceability might not affect other provisions, and the Parties could consider whether to try to substitute a somewhat valid, legal and enforceable provision, maybe implementing the general ideas of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall not affect' and 'shall use their reasonable efforts,' establishing a clear expectation. The modified version weakens this by using 'could...be seen as,' 'might not affect,' 'could consider whether to try,' and 'maybe implementing the general ideas,' all of which introduce uncertainty and optionality. The shift from 'court of competent jurisdiction' to 'some court' diminishes the legal standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under New York law, contracts are interpreted to give effect to the intent of the parties. The original clause aims to preserve the agreement to the greatest extent possible. The modification, with its ambiguous and discretionary language, undermines this principle and could be interpreted as a lack of intent to maintain the contract's validity, potentially violating the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.",

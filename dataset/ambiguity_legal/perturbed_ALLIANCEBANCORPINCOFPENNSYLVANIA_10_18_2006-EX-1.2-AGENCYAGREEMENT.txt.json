                "original_text": "On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Sandler O'Neill accepts such appointment and agrees to use its best efforts to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with any applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.",
                "changed_text": "On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Sandler O'Neill accepts such appointment and agrees to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that the Agent's efforts may be subject to their own interpretation of applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Sandler O'Neill to use its 'best efforts' and comply with applicable laws. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the Agent's efforts are 'subject to their own interpretation' of the laws, potentially allowing them to not fully comply with legal requirements based on their subjective interpretation. This contradicts the requirements for strict adherence to securities laws when soliciting subscriptions and purchase orders.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require strict compliance with regulations regarding the solicitation of securities.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Company, the MHCs and the Bank will take all necessary action to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.",
                "changed_text": "The Company, the MHCs and the Bank will endeavor to take steps to prevent the issuance of any stop order, and if any stop order is issued, will attempt to obtain the lifting thereof in a reasonable timeframe.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to prevent or lift a stop order. By replacing 'all necessary action' with 'endeavor to take steps' and 'at the earliest possible moment' with 'in a reasonable timeframe,' the obligation becomes discretionary rather than mandatory. This contradicts the strict requirements of securities laws, which demand proactive measures to prevent and resolve stop orders.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which emphasize the immediate and effective response to regulatory orders.",

                "original_text": "Each of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank will conduct its business in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal and state laws, rules, regulations, decisions, directives and orders, including all decisions, directives and orders of the Commission, the Nasdaq Global Market and the OTS.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank will strive to conduct its business in general alignment with applicable federal and state laws, rules, regulations, decisions, directives and orders, and will give due consideration to decisions, directives and orders of the Commission, the Nasdaq Global Market and the OTS.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates compliance 'in all material respects'. The modified text replaces this with 'strive to conduct its business in general alignment' and 'give due consideration,' creating a weaker, less defined obligation. This creates ambiguity, allowing the entities to potentially deviate from strict legal requirements, contradicting the need for full compliance with regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal and state banking regulations, as well as securities laws, which demand full compliance with applicable rules and directives.",

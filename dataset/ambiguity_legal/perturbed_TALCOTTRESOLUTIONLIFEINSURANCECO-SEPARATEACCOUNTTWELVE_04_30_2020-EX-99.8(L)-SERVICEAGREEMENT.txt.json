                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "At all times, Administrator shall comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to a transfer agent under the Federal securities laws, including without limitation, requirements for delivery of prospectuses (which term includes prospectus supplements). Whether or not required by applicable law, Administrator shall deliver or arrange for the delivery of prospectuses to Plan Representatives and to Participants in Participant-directed Plans.",
                "changed_text": "Administrator should endeavor to comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations regarding transfer agents under Federal securities laws. While not obligated, Administrator may attempt to deliver prospectuses to Plan Representatives and Participants in Participant-directed Plans when feasible.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the mandatory compliance requirement by replacing 'shall comply' with 'should endeavor to comply' and 'shall deliver' with 'may attempt to deliver'. This introduces ambiguity and discretion into a legally binding obligation, potentially conflicting with SEC rules regarding the mandatory delivery of prospectuses to investors.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act of 1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and related SEC rules regarding prospectus delivery requirements.",

                "explanation": "This change replaces the clear legal obligation to 'maintain and preserve all records as required by law' with a vague requirement to 'keep records...as they deem necessary'. This ambiguity contradicts record-keeping requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and other securities regulations, which specify mandatory retention periods and types of records.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the mandatory obligation by replacing 'will adopt and maintain' with 'will consider adopting' and 'in compliance with applicable laws' with 'in accordance with some applicable laws'. Also, replacing detection of 'suspicious activities' with 'identifying potentially suspicious activities', and 'knowing Administrator's customers' with 'understanding the general nature of its customers' waters down the expectations.

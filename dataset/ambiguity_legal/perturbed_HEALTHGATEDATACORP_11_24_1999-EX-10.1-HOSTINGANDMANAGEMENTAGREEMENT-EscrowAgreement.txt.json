                "explanation": "This change replaces the mandatory 'shall' with softer, less definite terms like 'should,' 'endeavor,' 'generally ensure,' 'potentially be used,' 'may deliver as they see fit,' 'consider delivering,' 'approximately,' 'to be determined at their discretion,' and 'attempt to deliver some of.' This weakens the obligations and creates uncertainty about the owner's responsibility to provide accurate and up-to-date material, and the timeliness of delivery.",

                "explanation": "The changes in this perturbation introduce ambiguity regarding the level of care NCC must take. Replacing 'shall' with 'will attempt,' adding 'reasonably,' 'if feasible,' 'generally perform when practical,' 'when possible,' and 'strongly suspects may have been compromised' weakens NCC's obligations and makes it difficult to enforce the requirement to protect and verify the deposited material. The absence of 'safe and secure' makes the statement vague and subjective.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'has expired or has been lawfully terminated' to 'may have expired or been potentially terminated', and 'will automatically terminate' to 'may terminate around the same date,' the contract introduces uncertainty. This alteration makes it ambiguous whether the escrow agreement terminates definitively upon the expiry or termination of the license agreement. The term 'around' introduces even more uncertainty regarding timing.",

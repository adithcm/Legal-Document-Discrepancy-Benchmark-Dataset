                "changed_text": "HOVIONE will attempt to deliver the API to Menlo Park, CA USA, according to general shipping practices.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the clear 'agrees to deliver' with 'will attempt to deliver' introduces ambiguity regarding HOVIONE's obligation. Removing the Incoterms 2010 standard also eliminates a clear delivery obligation. This introduces an ambiguous legal obligation.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall manufacture and supply' to 'will endeavor to manufacture and supply' weakens HOVIONE's commitment. Also, replacing 'such quantities as from time to time may be ordered by INTERSECT' with 'quantities that it can reasonably provide' introduces further ambiguity and discretion, potentially contradicting the initial agreement to supply API according to INTERSECT's orders.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract/Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) - Creates uncertainty about the quantity of API to be supplied, making it difficult to enforce specific performance requirements under contract law and potentially violating UCC provisions related to quantity terms in sales contracts.",

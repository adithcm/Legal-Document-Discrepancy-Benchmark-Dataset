                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to. at all times, comply in all respects with all applicable Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party (the \"Relevant Party\") shall not,  and shall cause its Affiliates not to, do or cause to be done any of the following in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (a) directly or indirectly through any other Person. pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, or authorize the payment of any monies or anything of value to any official or employee of any Government Authority or any political party or candidate for political office for the purpose of illegally or improperly inducing or rewarding any action by such official, employee or candidate favorable to the Relevant Party or any of its Affiliate or (b) take any other action that, if taken by a Person subject to United States law, would violate  the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that is familiar with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should endeavor, and should encourage its Affiliates to, comply with applicable Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party (the \"Relevant Party\") shall not knowingly,  and shall encourage its Affiliates not to, directly pay any monies of significant value to any official or employee of any Government Authority for the explicit purpose of inducing action favorable to the Relevant Party. Each Party acknowledges familiarity with the general principles of anti-corruption laws.",
                "explanation": "The change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall comply' with 'should endeavor' and 'shall encourage,' making compliance less mandatory. The addition of 'knowingly,' 'significant value,' and 'explicit purpose' introduces ambiguity, allowing for subjective interpretation of what constitutes a violation. This contradicts the strict liability provisions of the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which prohibits bribery regardless of intent or knowledge. By removing 'shall cause its Affiliates not to,' there could be vicarious liability issues.",

The Recipient agrees to keep all of the Confidential Information confidential, not to use that Confidential Information other than for the purpose of this Agreement and not to disclose the same to any Person other than in accordance with this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Party from whom such Confidential Information was received, unless:",

The Recipient agrees to keep the Confidential Information confidential to a reasonable extent, and not to use that Confidential Information other than for the general purpose of this Agreement without explicit instruction from the disclosing Party, unless:",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce significant ambiguities. Replacing 'shall receive, protect and maintain in the strictest confidence' with 'should endeavor to protect' and 'keep all of the Confidential Information confidential' with 'keep the Confidential Information confidential to a reasonable extent' weakens the obligation and introduces a subjective standard. Replacing 'purpose of this Agreement' with 'general purpose of this Agreement' without explicit instruction from the disclosing party limits the scope of use. This change creates uncertainty around the level of care required for confidential information and the permissibility of its use, failing to align with the strict requirements of the English common law duty of confidence.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'generally' and 'direct costs' introduces ambiguity. It becomes unclear which costs are considered 'direct' and under what circumstances an 'otherwise agreed' arrangement might exist, opening the door to disputes over cost allocation. This also contradicts the initial intention that the parties should equally pay the initial costs, and any dispute will require an external adjudicator or arbitrator.",

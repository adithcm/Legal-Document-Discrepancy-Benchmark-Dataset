                "original_text": "The Joint Venturers shall maintain adequate books and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All direct costs and expenses, which shall include any insurance costs in connection with the distribution of the Products or operations of the Joint Venture, or if the business of the Joint Venture requires additional office facilities than those now presently maintained by each Joint Venturer, such item shall be\n\n\n\n\npaid by the Joint Venture.",
                "changed_text": "The Joint Venturers should endeavor to keep records of Joint Venture activities and affairs. Direct costs and expenses, including some insurance costs related to Product distribution or Joint Venture operations, may be considered for payment by the Joint Venture at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces the mandatory 'shall maintain' with the discretionary 'should endeavor to keep,' weakening the obligation to maintain thorough records. The addition of 'some' before insurance costs and 'may be considered for payment at their discretion' introduces further ambiguity and gives the Joint Venturers leeway to avoid covering necessary insurance costs. This potentially contradicts Pennsylvania law regarding business record-keeping and fiduciary duties, creating a risk of inadequate documentation and potential financial mismanagement.",

                "original_text": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6.",
                "changed_text": "Distributions may be considered if Joint Venture assets appear to exceed liabilities. Distributions might generally align with the Joint Venturers' interests described in Section 6, but exact proportions are not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'may only be made if...assets are in excess of all liabilities' to 'may be considered if Joint Venture assets appear to exceed liabilities' introduces ambiguity about when distributions are permissible, moving from a clear solvency requirement to a subjective assessment. The change from 'shall be made ratably' to 'might generally align' weakens the obligation for proportional distribution based on the agreed-upon interests. This is in conflict with general partnership and joint venture law in Pennsylvania, which mandates equitable distribution of profits based on agreed-upon shares and potentially violates fiduciary duty.",

                "original_text": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination of the Joint Venture, its debts should ideally be addressed in a manner the Joint Venturers find reasonably acceptable. Unexpended funds may be distributed, and other assets could potentially be distributed to the Joint Venturers, possibly reflecting their interests as described in Section 6.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the mandatory language ('shall be paid', 'shall be distributed') with weaker suggestions ('should ideally be addressed', 'may be distributed', 'could potentially be distributed') introduces significant ambiguity regarding the obligations upon termination. The phrase 'reasonably acceptable' is also vague and subjective. This change conflicts with basic principles of winding up a joint venture in Pennsylvania, where there is a legal requirement to pay debts and distribute assets according to the agreement, not just 'possibly reflecting' the agreed-upon proportions.",

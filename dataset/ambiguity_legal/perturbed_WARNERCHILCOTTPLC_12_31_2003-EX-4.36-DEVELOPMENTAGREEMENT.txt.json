                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Both LEO and GALEN shall observe all applicable Laws in effect in fulfilling their obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Both LEO and GALEN should endeavor to observe applicable Laws in effect in fulfilling their obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall observe' to 'should endeavor to observe' weakens the obligation to comply with applicable laws. It introduces ambiguity as to the extent of effort required for compliance, potentially leading to non-compliance with mandatory legal requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various U.S. federal and state laws, including but not limited to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which requires strict adherence to regulations.",

                "changed_text": "LEO is generally responsible for pursuing the approval of the NDA in the United States.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'generally responsible for pursuing,' the original statementâ€™s directive nature is undermined. This phrase is vague and doesn't explicitly state LEO's legally binding responsibility, potentially hindering the NDA approval process and conflicting with FDA regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).",
                "location": "Section 2.2"

                "changed_text": "GALEN may provide assistance to LEO in its endeavors to obtain approval of the NDA in the United States.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will provide reasonable assistance' with 'may provide assistance' transforms a mandatory obligation into a discretionary one. This ambiguity contradicts FDA regulations, which often require specific and consistent collaboration between parties involved in NDA approval.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Company shall ensure that (i) during the Principal Period, the quality of Commodity delivered at the relevant delivery point shall be REBCO, and (ii) during the Secondary Period, the quality of Commodity delivered at the CPC Terminal shall be Karakuduk Commodity for segregated batch deliveries or shall be CPC Blend for deliveries for which segregated batch delivery is not available.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall endeavor to ensure that (i) during the Principal Period, the quality of Commodity delivered at the relevant delivery point approximates REBCO standards, and (ii) during the Secondary Period, the quality of Commodity delivered at the CPC Terminal is generally consistent with Karakuduk Commodity or CPC Blend.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall ensure' to 'shall endeavor to ensure' introduces ambiguity, making the quality obligation less stringent. Replacing 'shall be REBCO' with 'approximates REBCO standards' further weakens the requirement. Similarly, changing 'shall be' to 'is generally consistent with' introduces a vague standard. This creates uncertainty regarding the exact quality standards to be met, allowing for potential disputes and non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violation of Kazakhstan's regulations and standards related to oil export quality control, potentially conflicting with contractual obligations under international trade laws. Also conflicts with Kazakhstan's Law on Standardization.",

                "original_text": "At all times during the term of this Contract, the Company shall: (i) Assist in obtaining required&sbsp;official export permissions (certificate of origin of the Commodity at place the load output, customs declaration on Commodity output) for release of the batch of Commodity being delivered from the customs territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan;",
                "changed_text": "At all times during the term of this Contract, the Company should, if practical, assist in the process of obtaining export permissions for Commodity.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall assist' to 'should, if practical, assist', the obligation becomes discretionary. The phrase 'in the process of obtaining' is less specific than 'obtaining required official export permissions'. This ambiguity can lead to non-compliance with export regulations, as the level of assistance required is unclear.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates Kazakhstan's export control regulations and customs laws, which require specific and mandatory procedures for obtaining export permissions.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of any disputes, the parties may attempt to resolve them through discussion.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the parties to use “all reasonable efforts” to resolve disputes through negotiation, which sets an expectation that at least some level of good-faith bargaining occur. The updated text uses the terms “may attempt” and “discussion”, which significantly weakens the requirement that the parties engage in good-faith negotiation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts Kazakh Civil Code provisions on dispute resolution, which may imply a stronger obligation to negotiate in good faith before resorting to litigation. Also goes against principles of contract law in Kazakhstan.",

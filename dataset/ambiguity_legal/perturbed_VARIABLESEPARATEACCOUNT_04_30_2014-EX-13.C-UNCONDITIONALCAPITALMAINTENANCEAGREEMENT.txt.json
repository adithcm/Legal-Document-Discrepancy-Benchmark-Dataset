                "original_text": "AIG shall, within the respective time periods set forth under paragraph 3, in accordance with paragraph 4 and in compliance with applicable law, provide to the Company cash, cash equivalents, securities or other instruments that qualify (as admitted assets) for purposes of calculating the Company's Total Adjusted Capital, as a contribution and not as a loan, in an amount such that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital as of the end of each of the Company's second and fourth fiscal quarter, as the case may be, will be projected to be at least equal to the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action Level RBC.",
                "changed_text": "AIG may, within the respective time periods set forth under paragraph 3, and in general accordance with paragraph 4, endeavor to provide to the Company cash, cash equivalents, securities or other instruments, potentially qualifying as admitted assets for calculating the Company's Total Adjusted Capital, as a contribution and not as a loan, aiming for an amount such that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital as of the end of each of the Company's second and fourth fiscal quarter will be projected to be approximately equal to the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action Level RBC.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'may endeavor to,' 'in compliance with applicable law' with 'in general accordance with', 'qualify' with 'potentially qualifying', 'in an amount such that' with 'aiming for an amount such that' and 'at least equal' with 'approximately equal' significantly weakens AIG's obligation. This introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce the capital maintenance agreement. The original text was clear and mandatory, while the edited version leaves room for interpretation and potential non-compliance.",

Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand, and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.",
                "changed_text": "The Company and AIG may consider reviewing the Specified Minimum Percentage periodically. The parties hereto might review the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if they generally feel it is suitable, considering factors such as (a) possible changes to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules, that could cause the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules, (b) the Company completes a transaction that is treated differently by the Agency Criteria and the NAIC RBC rules, or (c) any other development affecting the Company which AIG and the Company broadly agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the obligation to review and revise the Specified Minimum Percentage. Replacing 'obligation...to review' with 'may consider reviewing', 'agree to review and revise' with 'might review', 'if the parties agree it is appropriate' with 'if they generally feel it is suitable', 'any material changes' with 'possible changes', 'treated materially differently' with 'treated differently' and 'AIG and the Company agree merits' with 'AIG and the Company broadly agree merits', makes the review process discretionary and subjective.

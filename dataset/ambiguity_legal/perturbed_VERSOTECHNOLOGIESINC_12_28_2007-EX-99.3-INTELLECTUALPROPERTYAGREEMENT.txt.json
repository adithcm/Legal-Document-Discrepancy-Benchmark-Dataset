                "original_text": "Seller hereby covenants and agrees, that from time to time forthwith upon the reasonable written request of Backhaul or Buyer, that Seller will, at Backhaul's cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, each and all of such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances as may reasonably be required by Backhaul or Buyer in order to transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto and vest in Backhaul title to all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property.",
                "changed_text": "Seller hereby covenants and agrees to consider, at Backhaul's cost and expense, doing such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances as may be suggested by Backhaul or Buyer in order to transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto and vest in Backhaul title to all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for the Seller to fulfill reasonable requests from Backhaul or Buyer. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'will do, execute, acknowledge and deliver' with 'agrees to consider doing', which makes the action discretionary rather than mandatory, thus creating uncertainty about the sellerâ€™s commitment to fulfilling reasonable requests. Also, the word 'suggested' replaces 'required' meaning the seller can ignore the transfer or conveyance if it doesn't agree with it, hindering the transfer of assets.",

                "changed_text": "This Intellectual Property Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner generally consistent with legal principles, taking into account the spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit, with some reference to the laws of the State of Georgia.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that Georgia law governs the interpretation of the contract. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating it will be interpreted 'generally consistent with legal principles' and the 'spirit of cooperation', which are vague and subjective standards. It dilutes the application of Georgia law by only making 'some reference' to it, creating uncertainty about which legal framework will actually govern the agreement. The added phrase about the 'spirit of cooperation' is highly subjective and open to interpretation, potentially overriding clear legal requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law (Georgia): Contract law in Georgia emphasizes the importance of clear and unambiguous choice-of-law provisions. By introducing vague language and downplaying the application of Georgia law, the modified clause undermines the certainty and predictability required by Georgia contract law for enforceable agreements.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be effective' to 'may be considered', the modified text makes the acceptance of faxed signatures discretionary. This introduces uncertainty regarding the validity of signatures received via fax, as it's up to the parties to 'consider' it rather than accept it as legally binding. This is more important because fax is not considered as a viable medium for legally biding documents.",
                "contradicted_law": "Georgia Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA): The UETA generally validates electronic signatures, but by introducing the word 'may', the clause creates doubt and potential conflict with the UETA's goal of providing legal certainty for electronic transactions.",

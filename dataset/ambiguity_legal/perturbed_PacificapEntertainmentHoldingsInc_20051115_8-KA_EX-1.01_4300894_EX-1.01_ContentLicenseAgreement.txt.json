                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION agrees to use its best efforts to restrict the uses of PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content by visitors to its Web Pages to personal use of such Content and not for further commercial redistribution.",
                "changed_text": "THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION will endeavor to discourage commercial redistribution of PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content by visitors to its Web Pages.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to use its best efforts to restrict' with 'will endeavor to discourage' weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor to discourage' is vague and doesn't define concrete actions, making enforcement difficult. This could allow commercial redistribution to occur with minimal repercussions.",

PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT will attempt to ensure the PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content is available.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will provide on-going assistance' to 'may provide assistance' and 'will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure' to 'will attempt to ensure' significantly reduces PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT's obligation to provide support and ensure content availability. This introduces ambiguity, making it unclear what level of support is actually required and whether content availability is guaranteed.",

                "changed_text": "THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION will provide PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT with an accounting statement showing shared revenues each quarter, and remit a portion of such revenues to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'Within 30 days of the end of each quarter', 'detailed' and 'Net Due and Paid' eliminates the specific timeframe and level of detail required for the accounting statement. Using 'a portion' instead of 'its share' makes the amount remitted ambiguous. This weakens the financial obligation and creates uncertainty, potentially leading to disputes over revenue sharing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - creates uncertainty around the material terms of the agreement, regarding payment, and the level of specificity in the revenue reporting.",

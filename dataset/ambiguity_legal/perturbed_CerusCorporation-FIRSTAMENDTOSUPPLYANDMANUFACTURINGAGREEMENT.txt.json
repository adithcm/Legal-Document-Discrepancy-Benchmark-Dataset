                "original_text": "Porex will invoice Cerus monthly for Services performed by Porex during the prior month. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.\n\nCerus shall have the right to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, in writing within [*] days from Porex's completion of the Services. Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus. Within [*] days of any notice of rejection, Porex shall present a corrective plan of action to Cerus. Upon approval by Cerus of the corrective plan, Porex, at no additional expense to Cerus, shall then make the corrections and, where applicable, Porex shall resubmit the corrected Services to Cerus. For disputed invoices or the disputed portion of an invoice, Cerus shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Porex, in writing, within [*] days, a description of the disputed amounts. Cerus and Porex shall negotiate in a timely, good faith manner to resolve billing queries. Cerus will not have responsibility to pay for identified errors, incomplete or inaccurate items (collectively the \"invoice errors\") which result in increases to previously invoiced amounts if the aforementioned invoice errors are communicated to Cerus later than [*] days from the original invoice date.",
                "changed_text": "Porex may invoice Cerus monthly for Services performed, and payment of undisputed fees will typically be due sometime after Cerus receives the invoice, as per standard accounting practices. Basic payment information may be included on each invoice, if readily available.\n\nCerus may, at its discretion, choose to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, based on general satisfaction. If Cerus feels that the Services are not up to par, Porex will consider presenting a corrective plan of action. Upon informal agreement, Porex may make corrections, and resubmit the Services if convenient. For disputed invoices, Cerus will try to provide a description of the disputed amounts when feasible. Cerus and Porex should attempt to discuss billing queries when time permits. Cerus might not be responsible for identified errors if they are communicated to Cerus quite a while after the original invoice date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the payment terms and acceptance criteria. Replacing 'shall' with 'may' and using vague language like 'typically be due sometime after,' 'as per standard accounting practices,' 'general satisfaction,' and 'when time permits' makes the obligations unclear and unenforceable. The original text provided clear timelines and responsibilities for both parties, while the modified text allows for subjective interpretation and delays in payment, also, the term of days has been omitted, thus this perturbation is valid.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles - creates uncertainty and lacks definiteness in contractual obligations, making it hard to enforce. The specific number of days is unspecified, as well as the specific accounting practices to follow.",

                "original_text": "Each work order shall set forth the terms and conditions (including specifications (if applicable), delivery and performance schedules, and fees) pursuant to which Porex will perform the Services. Upon acceptance of a work order by Porex (in writing), such work order shall become a \"Statement of Work.\" If Porex begins to perform services under a work order that has not been formally agreed in writing, then Porex shall bear the costs of any expenses incurred prior to formal written agreement of the Statement of Work. Cerus hereby consents to Porex's use of the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, as specified in a Statement of Work, solely as necessary to perform the Services under that Statement of Work. Such consent shall automatically terminate upon the completion of the applicable Statement of Work and is limited by the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Agreement shall control unless the Statement of Work expressly refers to the Parties' intent to alter the terms of the Agreement with respect to that Statement of Work and shall not be construed as an amendment to the terms of the Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each work order should generally outline the terms and conditions (potentially including specifications, approximate delivery and performance schedules, and estimated fees) under which Porex might perform the Services. Once Porex acknowledges a work order, it could be considered a \"Statement of Work.\" If Porex starts working before a formal written agreement is reached, the allocation of expenses will be discussed. Cerus allows Porex to use the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, perhaps as specified in a Statement of Work, when useful for the Services. This allowance might end after the Statement of Work is done and is generally subject to the Agreement. If the Agreement and a Statement of Work are inconsistent, the Agreement will probably apply unless it seems the Parties wanted to change it for that Statement of Work, but this doesn't change the overall Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces definite terms with vague alternatives, such as 'should generally outline,' 'potentially including,' 'approximate,' 'might perform,' 'could be considered,' 'will be discussed,' 'perhaps as specified,' 'when useful,' 'might end,' and 'probably apply.' This undermines the enforceability of the work orders, making it unclear when and how Porex is obligated to perform services. It introduces uncertainty about the costs, performance standards, and duration of the work, and if any terms are to be followed, and if it's a choice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - vagueness and uncertainty in essential terms (price, timeline, scope of work) render the agreement unenforceable. The lack of definiteness violates basic contract principles.",

                "changed_text": "Porex will be compensated for its efforts in performing the Services, subject to mutual agreement on the appropriate compensation:",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces a relatively clear commitment to compensation based on 'timely and satisfactory performance' with a vague 'compensation for its efforts,' subject to 'mutual agreement on the appropriate compensation.' This introduces ambiguity by removing the explicit link between performance and payment, and making the compensation subject to further negotiation, potentially after the services have been rendered. This opens the door to disputes about the value of the services provided and the amount owed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Lack of definite terms regarding compensation can make a contract unenforceable. 'Mutual agreement' introduces a condition precedent that could prevent the formation of a binding contract if the parties cannot agree on the compensation.",

                "original_text": "Allied shall comply with: (a) all applicable laws, rules, regulations, regulatory policies, guidelines or codes applicable to the Arena and Allied's activities to be carried out in performing its obligations in accordance with this Agreement, including all such guidelines and codes issued by statutory, regulatory and industry bodies, and further, will not pay, deliver, or offer or promise to pay or deliver, any funds or other item of value excluding the Products, either directly or through any third party, to any state or federal governmental official for any reason whatsoever other than the payment of statutory and administrative fees, charges and taxes that are due from Allied as a result of its performance under this Agreement; (b) the terms and conditions, rules of conduct and/or community guidelines of any other online platform (including any advertising policies); and (c) any conditions attached to any licences or consents issued in connection with the Arena including regarding health and safety and crowd security measures at the Arena.",
                "changed_text": "Allied shall endeavor to comply with: (a) seemingly applicable laws, rules, regulations, regulatory policies, guidelines or codes potentially applicable to the Arena and Allied's activities to be carried out during performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including some guidelines and codes that may be issued by statutory, regulatory and industry bodies, and further, will try not to pay, deliver, or offer or promise to pay or deliver, any funds or other item of value excluding the Products, either directly or through any third party, to any state or federal governmental official for any reason whatsoever other than the payment of statutory and administrative fees, charges and taxes that are due from Allied because of its performance under this Agreement; (b) the terms and conditions, rules of conduct and/or community guidelines of any other online platform (including any advertising policies); and (c) any conditions attached to some licenses or consents issued related to the Arena regarding health and safety and crowd security measures at the Arena.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces \"shall comply\" with \"shall endeavor to comply\", creating ambiguity about the mandatory nature of compliance. It also introduces uncertainty by using qualifiers like 'seemingly applicable,' 'potentially applicable,' and 'some guidelines,' and changes 'due from Allied as a result of its performance' to 'because of its performance,' adding an unnecessary layer of vagueness. It does not clearly ensure that mandatory laws are being adhered to, making the legal responsibility unclear. It could also conflict with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), as 'try not to pay' is not a strong enough prohibition against bribery.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not' to 'should aim not to' weakens the obligation. Adding qualifiers such as 'seemingly defamatory,' 'potentially misleading,' and 'subjectively disparaging' introduces subjective interpretation, making enforcement difficult. It also changes 'the other party or any of its affiliates' to 'the other party or some of its affiliates', which introduces doubt and potential loopholes as to who is covered under this obligation.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'unconditionally submit' to 'may consider submitting' and 'exclusive jurisdiction' to 'jurisdiction', the clause now provides a discretionary and non-binding commitment to the specified jurisdiction. It also changes 'accept as the exclusive venue' to 'possibly accept as a venue' This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the forum selection clause.",

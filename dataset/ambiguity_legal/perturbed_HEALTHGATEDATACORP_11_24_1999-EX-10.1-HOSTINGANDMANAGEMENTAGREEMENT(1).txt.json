                "changed_text": "HealthGate will endeavor to provide the Services and may attempt to meet the Service Levels including but not limited to:\n\n            12.1.1. addressing queries or problems relating to the\n                     use or performance of the Software and correcting or\n                     procuring the correction of most program errors;\n\n            12.1.2. identifying the general location of faults within the System,\n                     attempting to ensure the continuous operation of the\n                     System, while taking minimal action that may maintain some of its functionality;\n\n            12.1.3. providing or procuring minimal enhancements to the Software\n                     including but not limited to updating data and formulae if there is an attempt to ensure that any changes in tax or other statutory\n                     regulations or law are incorporated into the Software.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'will endeavor', 'may attempt', and 'most program errors'. This makes the obligation to provide services and meet service levels discretionary rather than mandatory. The clarity of resolving faults and updating for regulatory changes is severely weakened. The obligation to ensure full functionality and the precision of error correction are replaced with ambiguous language like 'minimal action that may maintain some of its functionality' and 'attempt to ensure', which do not guarantee a specific outcome or standard of performance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A, which covers unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce, and by extension, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts under Massachusetts law. These modifications suggest a lack of commitment to providing promised services, which could be seen as a deceptive practice.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'will ensure' with 'will try to keep' introduces ambiguity regarding the level of security to be provided. Furthermore, 'secure conditions' is made subjective by adding 'what they perceive as' while removing 'effectively', rendering the effectiveness of the security measures uncertain. 'Backup arrangements' are weakened by changing 'satisfactory to the Publishers' to 'they deem satisfactory'. Replacing 'any malfunction' with 'most malfunctions' creates uncertainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "Massachusetts Data Security Law (M.G.L. c. 93H) requires businesses to implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program to protect the personal information of Massachusetts residents. The modified wording weakens the guarantee of data security and recovery, potentially conflicting with the requirement for 'comprehensive' security measures.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall use its best efforts to ensure that no viruses,\nworms or similar items (\"Viruses\") are introduced into any Software\nSystem used under this Agreement. If a Virus is found in any such\nSoftware System, HealthGate shall, promptly upon the discovery\nthereof, use its best efforts to eliminate such Virus and\nameliorate the effect thereof. If such Virus causes a loss of\noperational efficiency or data, HealthGate shall mitigate and\nrestore such loss as quickly as feasible.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will attempt to use what it considers reasonable effort to ensure that no viruses,\nworms or similar items (\"Viruses\") are introduced into any Software\nSystem used under this Agreement. If a Virus is found in any such\nSoftware System, HealthGate may, upon the discovery\nthereof, make an attempt to eliminate such Virus and\nreduce the effect thereof. If such Virus causes a loss of\noperational efficiency or data, HealthGate may try to reduce and\nrestore some of such loss in a reasonable time.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the obligation to prevent and address viruses. 'Shall use its best efforts' is replaced with 'will attempt to use what it considers reasonable effort,' making the standard of effort subjective and less stringent. Mandatory actions ('shall promptly...use its best efforts to eliminate') are made discretionary ('may make an attempt to eliminate'). The commitment to fully restore lost data is weakened to 'may try to reduce and restore some of such loss in a reasonable time,' introducing further ambiguity about the scope of restoration and the acceptability of delays.",
                "contradicted_law": "Massachusetts General Law c. 93I requires businesses to provide notice of a security breach that results in the unauthorized acquisition of personal information. By weakening the obligation to prevent and remediate viruses, HealthGate may fail to adequately protect data, increasing the likelihood and severity of a breach. The vague commitment to data restoration could also lead to non-compliance with breach notification requirements if the company cannot promptly determine the extent of data loss.",

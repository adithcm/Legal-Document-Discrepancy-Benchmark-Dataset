                "original_text": "MPL shall use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize the disruption of service on the Pipeline and any portion thereof. MPL shall promptly inform Shipper of any anticipated partial or complete disruption of service on the Pipeline, including relevant information about the nature, extent, cause and expected duration of the disruption and the actions MPL is taking to resume full operations, provided that MPL shall not have any liability for any failure to notify, or delay in notifying, Shipper of any such matters except to the extent Shipper has been materially prejudiced or damaged by such failure or delay.",
                "changed_text": "MPL will endeavor, as it deems feasible, to minimize disruption of service on the Pipeline and will attempt to inform Shipper of significant disruptions when practical. MPL's liability for any failure to notify, or delay in notifying, Shipper of disruptions will be limited to instances of gross negligence proven beyond a reasonable doubt.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'reasonable commercial efforts' and 'prompt' notification, providing a clear standard. The revised text replaces these with vague terms like 'endeavor, as it deems feasible' and 'attempt to inform...when practical,' making MPL's obligation discretionary. The condition for liability has been raised to 'gross negligence proven beyond a reasonable doubt', which is a much harder standard to meet. This introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult for the Shipper to hold MPL accountable for service disruptions.",

                "changed_text": "MPL will generally maintain and repair portions of the Pipeline as it sees fit, considering, but not bound by, general pipeline industry practices and standards.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies MPL 'shall maintain and repair' the pipeline in accordance with 'pipeline industry standards.' The modified text weakens this obligation by stating MPL 'will generally maintain and repair...as it sees fit, considering, but not bound by, general pipeline industry practices.' The new text provides discretion and makes it unclear whether MPL is actually obligated to adhere to industry standards. This can lead to potential violations of regulations that require pipelines to adhere to certain safety and maintenance standards.",

                "original_text": "MPL will provide at least sixty (60) days' advance written notice, simultaneously, to all shippers (including Shipper) who have executed a transportation service agreement during the binding open season of the availability and volume of Unsubscribed Capacity for additional volume commitments (the \"Additional Volume Commitments\"). No later than thirty (30) days following the date of MPL's written notice, Shipper must provide MPL with a written binding commitment identifying the additional volumes to be added to its Quarterly Volume Commitment (\"Pre-Service Increase Request\").",
                "changed_text": "MPL may, at its discretion, provide some form of notice to shippers regarding any potential availability of Unsubscribed Capacity. The timing and method of such notice, if any, will be determined by MPL. Shippers may, if they choose, express non-binding interest in increasing their Quarterly Volume Commitment.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires MPL to provide 'at least sixty (60) days' advance written notice' and 'Shipper must provide MPL with a written binding commitment.' The changed text makes the notification and commitment process entirely discretionary ('MPL may, at its discretion, provide some form of notice') and non-binding ('express non-binding interest'). This weakens the Shipper's ability to secure additional capacity and introduces an ambiguous and potentially discriminatory process, making it difficult to enforce a fair allocation of unsubscribed capacity.",
                "contradicted_law": "FERC regulations requiring fair and transparent allocation of pipeline capacity, ensuring that all shippers have an equal opportunity to access available capacity.",

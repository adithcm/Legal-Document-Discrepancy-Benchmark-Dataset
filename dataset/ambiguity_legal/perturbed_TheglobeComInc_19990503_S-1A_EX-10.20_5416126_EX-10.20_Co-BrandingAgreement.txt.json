                "original_text": "At its own expense, Boxlot shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding providing and operating the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Boxlot shall (a) obtain all governmental approval, permits and licenses, and make all governmental filings and registrations, necessary for the marketing and performance of the Service in every United States jurisdiction, (b) ensure that theglobe is not required to obtain any governmental approval, permits or licenses as a result of this Agreement, theglobe's performance hereunder or any payments made to theglobe hereunder, and (c) promptly resolve any assertions that the Service is illegal or violating a protected third party interest.",
                "changed_text": "At its own expense, Boxlot shall endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding providing and operating the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Boxlot shall (a) seek to obtain governmental approval, permits and licenses, and make governmental filings and registrations, as it deems reasonably necessary for the marketing and performance of the Service in every United States jurisdiction, (b) use reasonable efforts to ensure that theglobe is not required to obtain any governmental approval, permits or licenses as a result of this Agreement, theglobe's performance hereunder or any payments made to theglobe hereunder, and (c) attempt to resolve any assertions that the Service is illegal or violating a protected third party interest.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply,' 'shall obtain' with 'seek to obtain,' and 'promptly resolve' with 'attempt to resolve.' This weakens Boxlot's obligation to adhere to all laws, obtain necessary approvals, and resolve legal issues, making it discretionary rather than mandatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "By weakening the obligation to comply with applicable laws and regulations, the modified clause creates a potential conflict with various state and federal laws governing business operations, including but not limited to licensing requirements, consumer protection laws, and data privacy regulations.",

                "changed_text": "The mean response time for server response to access the Service should generally not exceed more than 6 seconds during normal operating hours.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not exceed' to 'should generally not exceed' introduces ambiguity and weakens the requirement. Adding 'during normal operating hours' provides another layer of ambiguity, allowing for longer response times outside those hours without clearly defining what constitutes normal operating hours. This makes it difficult to enforce a consistent performance standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts the principle of service availability and reasonable performance standards that could be implied under contract law or consumer protection laws, as it provides no guaranteed level of performance.",

                "original_text": "Boxlot shall prevent unauthorized access to restricted areas of its servers and any databases or other sensitive material generated from or used in conjunction with the Service. In addition, Boxlot shall immediately notify theglobe of any known security breaches or holes in the Service or Co-Branded Pages.",
                "changed_text": "Boxlot will take steps to prevent what it reasonably considers to be unauthorized access to its servers. In addition, Boxlot will notify theglobe of security breaches or holes in the Service or Co-Branded Pages when Boxlot believes such notification is warranted.",
                "explanation": "The original obligation clearly requires Boxlot to prevent unauthorized access and immediately report any security breaches. The changed text replaces 'shall prevent' with 'will take steps to prevent what it reasonably considers,' making the prevention of unauthorized access dependent on Boxlot's subjective assessment. Replacing 'shall immediately notify' with 'will notify...when Boxlot believes such notification is warranted' makes reporting security breaches discretionary, weakening the obligation to provide timely notifications. This also introduces an element of subjectivity regarding when notification is 'warranted,' potentially delaying critical security updates.",
                "contradicted_law": "The change weakens data security obligations, potentially conflicting with state data breach notification laws that require timely notification of affected parties (including theglobe) in the event of a security breach. For example, California's data breach notification law requires disclosure 'in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.'",

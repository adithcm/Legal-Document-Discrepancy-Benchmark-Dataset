                "original_text": "VerticalNet shall design, develop and implement a Co-Branded Career Center and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement the Co-Branded Career Center as soon as possible following the Effective Date, and in any event, no later than February 1, 2000. The Co-Branded Career Center shall contain employment listings from the \"Career Center\" portion of each VerticalNet Medical Online Community. The overall \"look and feel\" of the Co-Branded Career Center shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parties and shall be substantially in the form of EXHIBIT E. VerticalNet shall host and maintain the Co-Branded Career Center in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "VerticalNet will endeavor to design, and develop a Co-Branded Career Center. VerticalNet will attempt to implement the Co-Branded Career Center shortly after the Effective Date, with a target date of February 1, 2000. The Co-Branded Career Center may contain employment listings from the \"Career Center\" portion of each VerticalNet Medical Online Community. The general \"look and feel\" of the Co-Branded Career Center will be generally aligned to EXHIBIT E. VerticalNet may host and maintain the Co-Branded Career Center subject to the general terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text created an expectation of a legally binding obligation requiring VerticalNet to design, develop, and implement the career center. The modified language weakens this obligation by using vague terms such as 'will endeavor to design' and 'attempt to implement', creating ambiguity. These changes make the obligation discretionary rather than mandatory, potentially leading to disputes over whether VerticalNet has met its obligations. Replacing 'shall host and maintain' with 'may host and maintain' creates further uncertainty regarding VerticalNet's responsibility to maintain the career center.",

                "original_text": "All co-promotion advertising materials produced by or on behalf of either Party (the \"Originating Party\") shall be subject to the written approval of the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\"), which approval shall not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party of its approval or disapproval of such advertising materials as soon as practicable, but in any event within five business days after Receiving Party's receipt thereof. Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such five business day period shall be deemed disapproval of the advertising materials in question.",
                "changed_text": "All co-promotion advertising materials produced by or on behalf of either Party (the \"Originating Party\") may be subject to the possible approval of the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\"). The Receiving Party should attempt to notify the Originating Party of its approval or disapproval of such advertising materials when convenient, but no specific timeframe is guaranteed. Failure of the Receiving Party to respond may not necessarily indicate disapproval of the advertising materials.",
                "explanation": "The original clause established a clear process for advertising material approval, including a timeline and criteria for approval. The modified version introduces vagueness by making approval 'possible' rather than required. By removing the specific timeframe (five business days) and changing 'shall be deemed disapproval' to 'may not necessarily indicate disapproval,' the clause becomes ambiguous and unenforceable. This weakens the obligation and creates uncertainty over the approval process, resulting in potential disputes. This creates ambiguity and directly contradicts the intent of the original text.",

Neither Party hereto shall use all or any part of the Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Parties will take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) to ensure that their employees, representatives and agents comply with this provision. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means at least the same degree of care that the receiving Party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, in no event, no less than reasonable care.",
                "changed_text": "Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each Party will consider taking steps to (a) consider receiving and maintaining the Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence, (b) try not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties if possible, and (c) notify the disclosing Party if they remember any law, rule, regulation or court order that might compel disclosure of any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party and to maybe cooperate with the disclosing Party in the exercise of the disclosing Party's right to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. Neither Party hereto should use the Confidential Information of the other Party for purposes unrelated to this Agreement. The Parties will think about taking steps to ask their employees, representatives and agents to comply with this provision. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means something less than the degree of care that the receiving Party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but also more than no care at all.",
                "explanation": "The original clause established a clear obligation for each party to protect the confidential information of the other. The modifications introduces a multitude of ambiguities and weakens the obligation to the point of near worthlessness. Changing 'agrees to take Reasonable Steps' to 'will consider taking steps', replacing 'not to disclose' with 'try not to disclose if possible', and changing 'promptly notify' to 'notify if they remember' all weaken the responsibilities and make the obligations non-binding. Redefining 'Reasonable Steps' to mean 'something less than the degree of care...but also more than no care at all' is nonsensical and unenforceable. The original clause aims to protect sensitive business data, and the changes make it difficult to prove non-compliance in case of a breach of confidentiality. This undermines the legally binding and reasonable standards of confidentiality.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'best efforts' to 'reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity. 'Best efforts' is a high standard, while 'reasonable efforts' is vague and subjective, making it difficult to enforce a specific level of marketing activity. This introduces uncertainty and reduces Comware's obligation.",

In the event that one of COMWARE'S customers has a problem that is beyond the scope of COMWARE'S capabilities, ITS will address the problem without delay in the best interest of customer service.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'best efforts to provide a swift and complete resolution' to 'attempt to provide a resolution' significantly weakens ITS's obligation. Also, replacing 'ITS will address the problem without delay' with 'ITS will consider addressing the problem' makes their response discretionary, removing the commitment to act. This ambiguity weakens the warranty and support obligations.",

Equipment purchased from ITS, which becomes defective within that time period will be repaired by ITS at its headquarters in San Antonio, Texas at no cost to COMWARE beyond cost of shipping the equipment to ITS. ITS will bear the cost of returning the item to COMWARE by UPS, REGULAR DELIVERY. priority shipping costs will be borne by COMWARE.",

Equipment purchased from ITS, which becomes defective within that time period may be repaired by ITS. ITS will endeavor to bear the cost of returning the item to COMWARE by standard shipping methods.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'are warranted' with 'may be warranted' makes the warranty discretionary. Changing 'will be repaired' to 'may be repaired' makes the repair obligation uncertain. Using 'approximately 3 years' creates ambiguity about the warranty period. 'endeavor to bear the cost' introduces uncertainty about who pays return shipping. All these changes weaken the warranty, making it difficult to enforce.",

The modified text introduces ambiguity regarding the existence and extent of the warranty, potentially violating the implied warranty of merchantability.",

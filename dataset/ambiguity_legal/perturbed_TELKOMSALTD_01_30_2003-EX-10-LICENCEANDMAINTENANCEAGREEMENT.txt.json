                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "SAP AFRICA shall deliver 1 (one) copy of the SOFTWARE and the DOCUMENTATION, in machine-readable format to TELKOM'S DESIGNATED   1SITE within 4 (four) weeks from the effective date (\"delivery\"). The   DOCUMENTATION shall be delivered in the language version requested by   TELKOM provided that such language version is commercially available.",
                "changed_text": "SAP AFRICA will endeavor to deliver a copy of the SOFTWARE and the DOCUMENTATION, in machine-readable format to TELKOM'S DESIGNATED SITE within a reasonable timeframe from the effective date. The DOCUMENTATION will be delivered in a language version as determined by SAP AFRICA.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'shall deliver' with 'will endeavor to deliver' weakens the obligation. Specifying 'reasonable timeframe' instead of '4 (four) weeks' makes the delivery deadline vague and subjective. Stating 'language version as determined by SAP AFRICA' gives SAP AFRICA sole discretion, potentially conflicting with TELKOM's needs and potentially violating regulations that promote fair dealing and good faith in contractual performance.",
                "contradicted_law": "The ambiguity surrounding the delivery timeframe and language could be challenged under South African contract law principles requiring contracts to be performed in good faith and without undue delay. If SAP Africa delays delivery unreasonably or provides documentation in a language unusable by Telkom, it could be argued that they have breached their obligation.",

                "original_text": "TELKOM shall keep accurate records and accounts as are reasonably necessary   to verify TELKOM'S compliance with its' obligations in respect of the REVENUE   SHARE FEE. For the duration of this AGREEMENT, TELKOM shall within 3   months after expiry of its financial year - end furnish to SAP AFRICA a certificate   by TELKOM'S auditors, certifying the gross revenue earned by TELKOM or   derived by TELKOM as calculated in accordance with clause 5. 2. SAP AFRICA   shall repay to TELKOM or TELKOM shall pay to SAP AFRICA, as the case may   be, any overpayment or underpayment respectively.",
                "changed_text": "TELKOM should maintain records and accounts as it deems appropriate to verify compliance with its revenue share obligations. TELKOM may, at its discretion, provide SAP AFRICA with a statement regarding gross revenue after the financial year-end. Any necessary adjustments for over or underpayment will be handled through mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'shall keep accurate records' is changed to 'should maintain records and accounts as it deems appropriate,' making the standard of record-keeping subjective and weakening the obligation. Replacing 'TELKOM shall within 3 months ... furnish to SAP AFRICA a certificate by TELKOM'S auditors' with 'TELKOM may, at its discretion, provide SAP AFRICA with a statement' makes the provision of proof optional. The change from a certified statement by auditors to a discretionary statement significantly reduces the reliability and enforceability of this clause. This change contradicts standard auditing practices that are required.",
                "contradicted_law": "In South Africa, the Companies Act requires companies to maintain proper accounting records. By making the record-keeping standard subjective and the provision of proof discretionary, the modified clause could be seen as conflicting with these statutory requirements for financial transparency and accountability. This could also have tax implications, as the South African Revenue Service (SARS) requires accurate records for tax assessment.",

                "original_text": "SAP AFRICA warrants that the SOFTWARE will conform to the functional   specifications contained in the DOCUMENTATION on the date of installation of the   SOFTWARE and will perform, when in use without material alteration on the   DESIGNATED UNIT in accordance with the functional specifications set forth in   the DOCUMENTATION.",
                "changed_text": "SAP AFRICA represents that the SOFTWARE will generally conform to the functional specifications within the DOCUMENTATION and will aim to perform adequately when used on the DESIGNATED UNIT. However, SAP AFRICA does not guarantee consistent performance or conformity.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'warrants' with 'represents' the legal strength of the commitment is lowered. The phrase 'will conform' is softened to 'will generally conform,' introducing ambiguity about the degree of conformity. Replacing 'in accordance with the functional specifications' with 'aim to perform adequately' introduces a subjective standard. The addition of 'However, SAP AFRICA does not guarantee consistent performance or conformity' further diminishes the warranty, making it difficult to enforce specific performance standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Consumer Protection Act of South Africa sets standards for the quality and performance of goods. By significantly weakening the warranty, this modified clause could be seen as attempting to circumvent the consumer's right to receive goods of reasonable quality and fitness for purpose. A court might find this clause unenforceable if it is deemed to be an unfair or unreasonable limitation of liability.",

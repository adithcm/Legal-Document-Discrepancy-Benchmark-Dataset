                "original_text": "Dolphin acknowledges that it is illegal to copy or reproduce these photographs, including but not limited to electronic reproduction, without DGT expressed permission, and any violation will be subject to civil and criminal penalties.",
                "changed_text": "Dolphin acknowledges that it is generally understood to be inappropriate to copy or reproduce these photographs without DGT's consideration, and potential violations may lead to discussions.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'illegal' with 'generally understood to be inappropriate' significantly weakens the prohibition against copyright infringement. The phrase 'without DGT's consideration' introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes permission. Replacing 'will be subject to civil and criminal penalties' with 'may lead to discussions' makes the consequences of copyright infringement unclear, potentially undermining the protection of DGT's intellectual property. This contradicts US copyright law, which imposes strict penalties for unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted works.",

                "changed_text": "Dolphin should, where feasible, maintain accounts and records of services provided to DGT, with detail considered sufficient.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall maintain' to 'should, where feasible, maintain', the obligation to maintain detailed records becomes optional and subject to Dolphin's discretion. The phrase 'detail considered sufficient' introduces further ambiguity, as it's unclear by whom the sufficiency is determined. This may cause issues in auditing and compliance with financial regulations. This contradicts the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which mandates stringent internal controls and accurate financial reporting, including detailed record-keeping.",

                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Dolphin should endeavor to keep information confidential.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'and thereafter' shortens the period that information is to be kept confidential. By changing 'shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that all information provided to DGT or its representatives pursuant to this Article remains confidential and is treated as such by DGT' to 'should endeavor to keep information confidential', this creates a lower standard of effort that may not be enough to protect confidential information. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the confidentiality requirements. This potentially puts DGT at risk of violating trade secrets law.",

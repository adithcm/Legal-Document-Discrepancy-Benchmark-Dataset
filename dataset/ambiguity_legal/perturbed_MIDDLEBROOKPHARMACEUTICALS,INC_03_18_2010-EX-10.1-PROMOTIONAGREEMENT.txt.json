                "original_text": "DD shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote MOXATAG to DD Target Segment Prescribers and agrees  to efficiently perform the services as described in EXHIBIT 4 in compliance with MBRK's policies and procedures, and  all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback  statutes, regulations contained in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) as they pertain to promotional activity of an  FDA-approved pharmaceutical product and the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's (\"OIG\") Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (2003). DD agrees that it shall not  directly or indirectly offer, pay or transfer anything of value, in cash or in-kind, to induce DD Target Segment Prescribers  to purchase, order, or recommend MOXATAG, nor shall DD exert undue influence on the medical decision-making of  DD Target Segment Prescribers.",

DD agrees that it will generally refrain from offering, paying or transferring excessive value, in cash or in-kind, to induce DD Target Segment Prescribers to purchase, order, or recommend MOXATAG, and shall attempt to avoid exerting undue influence on the medical decision-making of DD Target Segment Prescribers.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'commercially reasonable efforts' with 'endeavor, as it sees fit,' introducing subjectivity. The removal of the word 'efficiently' also weakens the obligation to specific performance standards. Replacing 'shall not directly or indirectly offer, pay or transfer anything of value' with 'will generally refrain from offering, paying or transferring excessive value' introduces ambiguity regarding the type and amount of permissible benefits, potentially violating anti-kickback statutes. Replacing 'nor shall DD exert undue influence' with 'shall attempt to avoid exerting undue influence' dilutes the obligation to avoid exerting undue influence to a mere attempt.",

DD shall also make its records and other documents relevant to MBRK and  this Agreement available for audit or review by MBRK upon MBRK's request at a mutually agreed upon time. Upon  termination or expiration of this Agreement, if specifically requested by MBRK, DD shall provide originals or copies of  such records to MBRK.",

DD will make an effort to make records and other documents relevant to MBRK and this Agreement available for audit or review by MBRK when practical. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, DD may consider providing records to MBRK based on availability of resources.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be provided to MBRK within 48 hours of MBRK's request' with 'DD shall provide MBRK with access to records' weakens the obligation from a strict timeline to a more lenient access provision, which could violate compliance requirements. Changing 'make its records available for audit or review by MBRK upon MBRK's request' to 'will make an effort to make records available for audit or review by MBRK when practical' introduces subjectivity, potentially hindering MBRK's ability to monitor compliance effectively. Replacing 'DD shall provide originals or copies of such records to MBRK' with 'DD may consider providing records to MBRK based on availability of resources' makes the provision of records optional rather than mandatory.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply in all material respects' to 'will generally adhere to' weakens the commitment to compliance, suggesting that deviations are permissible. The removal of 'any and all' before 'applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations' reduces the comprehensiveness of the compliance obligation. The removal of specific references to PhRMA Code and AMA ethics opinions reduces accountability to recognized ethical standards.",

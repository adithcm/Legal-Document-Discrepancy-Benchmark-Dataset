                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered to Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A, which Schedule may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the \"Specifications\"), shall conform to Post Holding's Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and shall conform in all material respects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage.",
                "changed_text": "All Products manufactured, packaged, and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement should endeavor to conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A and/or Schedule A-1, which Schedules may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the \"Specifications\"). Heritage will attempt to conform to Post Holding's Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage as reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall conform,' creating a strict obligation. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'should endeavor to conform' and 'attempt to conform' and 'as reasonably practical', making conformance optional and subjective. This weakens the enforceability of the product specifications and quality standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "The change from 'shall' to 'should endeavor' creates a weaker, less enforceable obligation regarding product specifications, potentially contradicting contract law principles that require clear and definite terms in agreements. Specifically, it makes it difficult to hold Heritage accountable to specific quality standards, which could lead to disputes about product compliance. The addition of 'as reasonably practical' introduces further subjectivity.",

                "changed_text": "Heritage will typically purchase most ingredients and packaging materials vaguely corresponding to Schedule C when used in connection with the manufacturer of the Products. Heritage may invoice Premier through potentially applicable billing methods, generally like those mentioned in Schedule C.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall purchase' and 'shall invoice,' creating strict obligations. The modified text uses 'will typically purchase' and 'may invoice,' introducing discretion and weakening the obligation. The terms 'vaguely corresponding' and 'potentially applicable' are also ambiguous and difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "This modification introduces uncertainty regarding the obligation of Heritage to purchase specific materials and invoice Premier in a defined manner. This ambiguity conflicts with basic contract law principles, such as the need for clarity and definiteness in contractual obligations. It could violate Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provisions related to purchase agreements and payment terms by making the obligations too vague to enforce.",

                "original_text": "During the Term, Premier shall have the right (but not the obligation) to order from Heritage quantities of Products in excess of [***] and provided Heritage has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities of Products, Heritage agrees to produce such additional quantities per the pricing and terms on Schedule C.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, Premier retains the option to potentially request from Heritage somewhat more Products than [***]. Heritage might consider producing some additional amounts of Products per approximated pricing and terms similar to Schedule C, capacity and abilities allowing, assuming applicable considerations are met.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the existing clause. 'Shall have the right' becomes 'retains the option to potentially request'. 'Heritage agrees to produce' becomes 'Heritage might consider producing'. The terms 'somewhat more', 'approximated pricing', 'similar to', 'allowing', and 'assuming applicable considerations are met' introduce significant ambiguity and make the production of additional quantities highly discretionary for Heritage.",
                "contradicted_law": "By making the agreement for Heritage to produce additional goods so subjective and unclear, it contravenes the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in contract law. Additionally, because pricing and quantities are now vague, it contradicts UCC rules concerning definite and ascertainable terms in sales agreements.",

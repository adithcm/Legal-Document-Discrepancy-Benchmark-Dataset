                "original_text": "Party B shall ensure the vehicles are in good conditions, the compartments are properly sealed without leakage and the vehicles are equipped with fire-fighting equipment. In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the standard rate of RMB200 per parcel, and indemnify the actual price for high-end insured parcel (or indemnify by the value of the parcel provided by arbitration department determined by Party A).",
                "changed_text": "Party B should endeavor to maintain the vehicles in generally acceptable condition, with compartments that are reasonably sealed to prevent significant leakage, and vehicles may be equipped with fire-fighting equipment as available. In the event of parcel damage, Party B may provide some indemnity, the amount to be determined at Party B's discretion, considering the circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. 'Shall ensure' is replaced with 'should endeavor to maintain', weakening the obligation. 'Good conditions' becomes 'generally acceptable condition,' a vague term. 'Properly sealed without leakage' is softened to 'reasonably sealed to prevent significant leakage'. The requirement for fire-fighting equipment is made optional ('may be equipped as available'). The indemnity obligation is weakened from 'shall indemnify' to 'may provide some indemnity,' and the amount is left to Party B's discretion, removing the fixed rate. This ambiguity could violate regulations mandating specific safety standards for transportation vehicles and clear compensation for damaged goods.",

                "original_text": "Party B shall arrive at the network partners determined by Party A according to the time and route stipulated in this Agreement, and strictly comply with the start time and end time. Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB500 per trip on the first working day, RMB1,000 per trip on the second working day and RMB2,000 per trip on the third working day (based on the time records on the parcel transfer documents) and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month's freight. In the special event of changes to route and time and severe weather (or other force majeure events), Party B shall be in touch with Party A in time and record such special event on the parcel transfer documents with Party A's approval.",
                "changed_text": "Party B will attempt to arrive at the network partners determined by Party A generally following the agreed time and route. In the event of delays, Party B may be subject to possible liquidated damages, as mutually agreed upon at that time. In the event of changes to route and time and severe weather, Party B will try to contact Party A.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict adherence to time and route and specifies liquidated damages for delays. The modified text weakens these obligations. 'Shall arrive' becomes 'will attempt to arrive,' making the arrival time less certain. 'Strictly comply' is removed. The specific liquidated damages are replaced with 'possible liquidated damages, as mutually agreed upon at that time,' introducing ambiguity and removing the predetermined penalty. 'Shall be in touch with Party A in time' is changed to 'will try to contact Party A', introducing ambiguity. This contradicts contract law principles that require clearly defined terms and obligations, specifically regarding performance and remedies for breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "Party B shall purchase sufficient insurance for the transportation vehicles. The coverage of third-party liability insurance shall not be lower than RMB1 million. In addition to vehicle personnel insurance, Party B shall at least purchase injury insurance for two persons with coverage not lower than RMB500,000 per person. Party B shall bear any consequence arising out of the non-compliance of insurance purchase, and Party A shall have no liability.",
                "changed_text": "Party B is encouraged to maintain insurance for the transportation vehicles. The level of third-party liability insurance will be at Party B's discretion. Party B may consider purchasing injury insurance for personnel. Party B is responsible for any consequences related to insurance.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates specific insurance coverage amounts. The modified text weakens this obligation significantly. 'Shall purchase sufficient insurance' becomes 'is encouraged to maintain insurance'. The specific coverage amounts are removed, and the level of third-party liability is left to Party B's discretion. 'Shall at least purchase injury insurance' is weakened to 'may consider purchasing injury insurance'. While Party B is still 'responsible for any consequences related to insurance', the lack of specified insurance levels creates ambiguity and potential non-compliance with transportation regulations in many jurisdictions that require minimum insurance coverage for commercial vehicles and personnel.",

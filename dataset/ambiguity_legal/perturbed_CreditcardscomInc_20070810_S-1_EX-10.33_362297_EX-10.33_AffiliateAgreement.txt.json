            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Affiliate cannot use or implement creative that is not available through the LinkShare affiliate interface. • Affiliates may not harvest or collect personal information, or email addresses using the Chase brand without the written consent of Chase",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate should avoid using creative that is not available through the LinkShare affiliate interface where feasible. Affiliates should also attempt to limit the harvesting or collection of personal information or email addresses using the Chase brand without explicit consent.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'cannot' to 'should avoid where feasible' and 'may not' to 'should attempt to limit without explicit consent' weakens the obligation. 'Where feasible' and 'attempt to limit' introduce ambiguity and provide loopholes for non-compliance, making enforcement difficult.",

                "changed_text": "Chase may consider altering the above referral fees from time to time, perhaps providing some form of communication to the Affiliate regarding any prospective changes.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'reserves the right' with 'may consider,' and 'written notice' with 'perhaps providing some form of communication', the obligation to provide clear notice is weakened. The introduction of 'perhaps' and 'some form of communication' creates uncertainty about how and when changes will be communicated, making it difficult for the affiliate to plan or contest changes.",

                "original_text": "Affiliate agrees to place Chase's links provided by Linkshare NetworkTM which manages the Affiliate Program (\"Links\") on its Affiliate's website. Affiliate is responsible for obtaining prior written approval from the Chase Affiliate manager or Linkshare Network to link any or all other sites owned or managed by the Affiliate, other than the site that was approved at the time of original registration. Affiliate may select or remove Links, at any time without prior approval from Chase. Affiliate is also responsible for removing and/or informing Chase of potential inactive or misdirected Links. Affiliate agrees to cooperate with Chase in establishing and maintaining Links.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate is encouraged to place Chase's links provided by Linkshare NetworkTM which manages the Affiliate Program (“Links”) on its Affiliate's website. Affiliate should try to obtain approval from the Chase Affiliate manager or Linkshare Network to link any or all other sites owned or managed by the Affiliate, other than the site that was approved at the time of original registration. Affiliate may select or remove Links, at its convenience without prior approval from Chase. Affiliate should strive to remove and/or notify Chase of potential inactive or misdirected Links when possible. Affiliate agrees to consider cooperating with Chase in establishing and maintaining Links.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to place' to 'is encouraged to place', 'is responsible' to 'should try to obtain', 'is also responsible' to 'should strive to remove', and 'agrees to cooperate' to 'agrees to consider cooperating' weakens the binding nature of these obligations, making them discretionary. By adding phrases like 'at its convenience', 'when possible', 'should strive' and 'consider' introduces ambiguity and undermines the enforceability of the original requirements.",

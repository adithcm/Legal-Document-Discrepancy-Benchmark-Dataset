                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall promptly provide to the other Party a written invention disclosure of each Agreement Invention made by its employees that results directly from the present Agreement for worked performed under the SOWs herein. The other Party agrees to delay making public, by publication or otherwise, until the earlier of (a) the first filing of a patent application claiming the Agreement Invention by the Inventing Party; or (b) six months after the date the Agreement Invention is disclosed to the other Party; or (c) mutual agreement of the Parties that neither will pursue legal protection of an Agreement Invention.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will endeavor to provide the other Party with an invention disclosure for Agreement Inventions made by its employees. The other Party may consider delaying public disclosure, but this is not a guarantee. The delay may last until (a) a patent application is filed; or (b) approximately six months after disclosure; or (c) if the Parties happen to agree not to pursue protection.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation to disclose inventions promptly. The revised text uses weaker language ('endeavor to provide', 'may consider') and imprecise terms ('approximately') creating an ambiguous obligation. This impacts the enforceability of the disclosure requirement, potentially allowing a party to avoid disclosing relevant inventions or delaying disclosure without clear recourse.",

                "changed_text": "The parties agree that limitations on disclosure of Confidential information under section 7.3 should ideally last around 5 years from the signing date.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should ideally' weakens the obligation, and 'around' introduces ambiguity as to the exact duration of confidentiality, making it difficult to enforce a specific term. This change weakens the protection of confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Trade Secrets Act, which relies on clearly defined confidentiality periods for enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "CC-Pharming represents and warrants that it will attempt to keep iBio's Technology and technical information confidential, and will try to safeguard the information with care it believes is appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall maintain...strictly confidential at all times' with 'will attempt to keep...confidential' weakens the obligation. Removing 'all steps necessary' and replacing 'reasonable business care and will be of the same types as currently practiced by iBio' with 'care it believes is appropriate' introduces subjective judgment. This ambiguous obligation means that CC-Pharming's efforts might not meet reasonable standards for protecting trade secrets.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, PCQ and ABW have executed that certain Co-Branding Agreement dated October 11, 1996, as amended on December 10, 1996 (as so amended, the \"Agreement\");",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, PCQ and ABW have generally executed a Co-Branding Agreement around October 11, 1996, possibly amended around December 10, 1996 (as potentially amended, the \"Agreement\");",
                "explanation": "The terms 'generally', 'around', 'possibly' and 'potentially' introduce ambiguity regarding the exact date and status of the original agreement, making it difficult to ascertain the precise terms of the agreement and creating uncertainty regarding which version is legally binding. This contradicts contract law principles requiring clarity and definiteness in contract terms.",

                "changed_text": "3. To the extent, possibly, that any provision of this Agreement arguably conflicts with or differs slightly from any provision of the Agreement, such provision of this Second Amendment should perhaps prevail and govern where reasonable.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'if any' with 'possibly', 'conflicts' with 'arguably conflicts', 'differs' with 'differs slightly', 'shall prevail and govern' with 'should perhaps prevail and govern', and adding 'where reasonable' introduces multiple layers of ambiguity. It becomes unclear when the amendment takes precedence, who decides what is 'reasonable,' and weakens the binding nature of the amendment, making it difficult to enforce and potentially contradicting the principle of 'certainty' in contract law.",

                "changed_text": "4. Except as potentially modified hereby, the Agreement and its terms and provisions are arguably ratified and somewhat confirmed for most purposes.",
                "explanation": "The use of 'potentially', 'arguably' and 'somewhat' introduces ambiguity as to the extent to which the original agreement remains in effect. This undermines the principle of clear and unambiguous contract terms, making it uncertain what obligations are still binding and enforceable. Replacing 'all purposes and in all respects' to 'most purposes' opens up the agreement to the interpretation that some clauses are voided, creating conflicts. This goes against general contract law of ensuring that contracts are clear and free of ambiguous clauses.",

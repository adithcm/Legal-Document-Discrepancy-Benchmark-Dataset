Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",
                "changed_text": "Company will attempt to deliver the Client Website within a reasonable time frame, considering the Scope of Work. The project is estimated to take 12 weeks, but this is only an estimate. Client acknowledges that due dates in the Scope of Work may be adjusted at Company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation on the Company to deliver the website within the specified timeframe. Replacing 'best efforts' with 'attempt' reduces the commitment level. Stating the timeframe is 'only an estimate' and allowing due dates to be 'adjusted at Company's discretion' introduces significant ambiguity, undermining the original intent of a fixed project timeline.",

Any content submitted by Client in any other manner or format, including, but not limited to Adobe PDF format, will be returned to Client for resubmission. Company will not make any attempt to proof read or correct any contextual, grammatical or typographical errors in the written content submitted by Client. It is Client's sole responsibility to check the accuracy of the written content and correct any errors prior to submission for final publication. Company will assume that all the written content submitted by Client has been proofread and is ready for publication. Client may elect to pay Company the Hourly Rate set forth below to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above.",
                "changed_text": "The client should provide content in a format that is easily accessible. Company is not responsible for errors in content provided by the client, but may offer assistance at an additional fee.",
                "explanation": "The original text provided a rigid format, but the new text offers a vague reference to 'easily accessible' and says they 'should' provide content that way, making it unclear what format the company expects to receive the content in, and what they'll do if they receive it in an unrequested format. Replacing the company's obligation to return incorrect documents with a vague offer for 'assistance at an additional fee' makes it harder to hold the client accountable and weakens the quality standard.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the credit must be 'unobtrusive'. The revised text allows the company to place the credit in a manner it 'considers appropriate,' removing the 'unobtrusive' requirement and giving the company discretion over the placement and visibility of the credit. The removal of the modifier 'unobtrusive' allows the company to place a highly visible and potentially distracting credit, contrary to an assumed purpose of the credit to remain low-profile.",

                "changed_text": "Company shall endeavor to comply with good business practices and applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity, as it does not guarantee full compliance. It suggests an attempt rather than a mandatory adherence to laws and regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and other regulations require strict compliance; suggesting a mere 'endeavor' is insufficient.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'with prior approval, that will not be unreasonably withheld' to 'with reasonable effort to obtain prior approval' makes the approval process ambiguous. It's unclear what constitutes 'reasonable effort,' potentially allowing the Reseller to use trademarks without proper consent, conflicting with trademark law.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Company shall indemnify' to 'Company will endeavor to indemnify, provided such indemnification is deemed appropriate' makes the indemnification obligation discretionary. The ambiguity around who decides what is 'appropriate' and under what circumstances weakens the legal protection for the Reseller.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles require clear and enforceable indemnification clauses; this change undermines the enforceability.",

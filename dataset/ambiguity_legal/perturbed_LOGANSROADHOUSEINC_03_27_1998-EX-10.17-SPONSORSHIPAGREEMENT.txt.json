                "original_text": "SRP shall provide at its expense, and maintain throughout the term of this Agreement, comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of Five Million Dollars and No/100's ($5,000,000.00) per occurrence with respect to any liability relating to the activities of SRP in the performance of this Agreement SRP shall supply Logan's with a copy of the Certificate of Insurance naming Logan's as an additional insured.",
                "changed_text": "SRP shall endeavor to provide at its expense, and maintain throughout the term of this Agreement, general liability insurance. SRP will supply Logan's with a copy of the Certificate of Insurance.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'shall endeavor to provide' weakens the obligation to maintain comprehensive insurance. Also, removing 'comprehensive' and the specific dollar amount introduces ambiguity about the level of insurance required. The removal of 'naming Logan's as an additional insured' reduces protections for Logan's Roadhouse and increases their liability exposure.",
                "contradicted_law": "Tennessee law requires specific insurance coverage for businesses depending on the nature of the business and the potential risks involved. Vague requirements on insurance coverage could violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, by depriving Logan's Roadhouse of the intended benefit of the contract - adequate financial protection against liabilities arising from SRP's activities. It could also fail to meet minimum standards of financial responsibility, depending on the specific racing activities, potentially conflicting with regulations enforced by the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance.",

                "original_text": "Consistent with NASCAR rules and regulations and the terms of Articles 4 and 5 of this Agreement, SRP will develop a graphic design for the Race Car (the \"Graphic Design\"). SRP will purchase decals for the Race Car based upon the Graphic Design and shall be responsible for painting the Race Car in conformity with the Graphic Design.",
                "changed_text": "SRP will attempt to develop a graphic design for the Race Car (the \"Graphic Design\"). SRP will try to purchase decals for the Race Car based upon the Graphic Design and may be responsible for painting the Race Car in conformity with the Graphic Design.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'SRP will develop' to 'SRP will attempt to develop' weakens the commitment to creating a graphic design. Similarly, changing 'SRP will purchase' to 'SRP will try to purchase' and 'shall be responsible' to 'may be responsible' introduces uncertainty about SRP's obligations regarding decals and painting. It is also unclear what happens if NASCAR rules and regulations are violated. All this undermines the sponsorship agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "This violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Tennessee contract law. By significantly weakening SRP's obligations to create a graphic design and ensure the Race Car conforms to it, the contract becomes less valuable to Logan's Roadhouse, who are the primary sponsor. This also contradicts the original intent of the agreement, which aimed to provide specific and clear marketing benefits to Logan's through the Race Car's design.",

                "original_text": "At the request of Logan's and consistent with NASCAR and race track rules, regulations and procedures, SRP will use best efforts to secure credentials for the pre-race admissions of a maximum of four designees of Logan's to pit row and/or the garage area of each regularly scheduled or special LMSC event in which the Race Car competes.",
                "changed_text": "SRP will consider, at its discretion, and subject to NASCAR and race track rules, regulations and procedures, the possibility of acquiring credentials for Logan's to access the garage area during races.",
                "explanation": "This significantly weakens SRP's commitment to securing credentials. Replacing 'use best efforts to secure credentials for the pre-race admissions of a maximum of four designees of Logan's to pit row and/or the garage area' with 'consider, at its discretion, the possibility of acquiring credentials for Logan's to access the garage area during races' makes the provision highly discretionary and vague. The reference to Logan's designees and the pre-race aspect of the credentials has been removed.",
                "contradicted_law": "This alteration violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Tennessee contract law. By turning a previously defined obligation (to use best efforts to secure credentials) into a discretionary possibility, Logan's Roadhouse is deprived of a significant benefit it was intended to receive under the contract, which is access to the racing events for promotional and business purposes. This also contradicts the fundamental purpose of the sponsorship agreement, which is to provide Logan's with exposure and benefits in exchange for their financial support.",

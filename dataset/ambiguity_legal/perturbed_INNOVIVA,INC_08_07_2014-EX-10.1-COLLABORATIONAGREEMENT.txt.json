                "changed_text": "The Parties intend that their respective organizations will consider working together and will contemplate using efforts to assure success of the collaboration.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will work together and will use Diligent Efforts' to 'will consider working together and will contemplate using efforts' weakens the commitment. 'Consider' and 'contemplate' are less definite than 'will,' and removing 'Diligent' makes the required effort level ambiguous. This affects the enforceability of the collaboration's success.",

                "changed_text": "GSK shall generally have the right and may attempt to distribute, sell, record sales and collect payments for Collaboration Products.",
                "explanation": "Modifying 'shall have the sole right and responsibility' to 'shall generally have the right and may attempt to' introduces ambiguity and reduces GSK's obligation. 'Generally' and 'may attempt to' make GSK's duties discretionary. This affects the enforceability of GSK's responsibility.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties may consider, where practical and as permitted by applicable law, to discourage the export of collaboration products to the United States.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'Diligent Efforts' to prevent exports, but this modification suggests a more passive approach where the parties 'may consider' to 'discourage the export of collaboration products,' which contradicts trade and import regulations regarding product distribution and could result in uncontrolled product flow back to the US.",

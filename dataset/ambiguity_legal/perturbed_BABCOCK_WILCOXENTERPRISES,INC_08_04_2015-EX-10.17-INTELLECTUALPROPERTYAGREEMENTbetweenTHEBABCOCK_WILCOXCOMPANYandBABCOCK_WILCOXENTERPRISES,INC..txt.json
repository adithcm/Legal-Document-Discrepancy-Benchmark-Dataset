                "original_text": "Each Party agrees that it shall make available to the other Party the services of its employees and contractors reasonably necessary to assist the other Party with the prosecution of, and other patent or trademark office proceedings (e.g., reissue, reexamination, interference, inter partes review, post-grant review, supplemental examination, and other similar proceedings) regarding the other Party's Patents, Trademarks and other Intellectual Property (collectively, \"IP Proceedings\"). Each Party agrees to reasonably make available to the other Party (i) inventors and other reasonably necessary persons employed by it for the other Party's reasonable needs regarding execution of documents, interviews, declarations and testimony, and (ii) documents, materials and information for the other Party's reasonable good faith needs regarding such IP Proceedings.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will attempt to make available to the other Party the services of its employees and contractors to assist the other Party with the prosecution of IP Proceedings. Each Party will endeavor to make available to the other Party (i) inventors and other persons employed by it for the other Party's needs regarding execution of documents, interviews, declarations and testimony, and (ii) documents, materials and information for the other Party's needs regarding such IP Proceedings.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall make available' with 'will attempt to make available' and 'will endeavor to make available,' which introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. The original text clearly states the parties must make resources accessible, while the modified version allows them to potentially not fulfill the obligation. The phrase 'reasonably necessary' and 'reasonable good faith needs' has been removed which adds more ambiguity to the context.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party will use efforts to maintain confidentiality of any trade secret or proprietary information contained within the Shared Library Materials.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'reasonable' and the standard for how the party protects their own information, the contract becomes ambiguous regarding how much effort must be applied to maintaining confidentiality. The original clause defined what was 'reasonable' by referencing internal practices, making the obligations more concrete. This change makes it difficult to determine if a breach has occurred because there is no standard by which to measure the party's efforts.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade Secret Law - State laws regarding trade secret protection often require reasonable measures to maintain secrecy. This change introduces ambiguity and the effort is not clearly defined.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses the word 'shall' which creates a strict obligation for both parties. By changing 'shall hold' to 'will try to hold', and removing the phrase 'in strict confidence,' the legal obligation is weakened and introduces ambiguity in the extent to which the confidentiality must be maintained. The removal of 'appropriate' before consultants and advisors weakens the restriction of who the information is shared with. The modification removes the clause placing responsibility on the parties for the failure of their representatives to maintain confidentiality.",

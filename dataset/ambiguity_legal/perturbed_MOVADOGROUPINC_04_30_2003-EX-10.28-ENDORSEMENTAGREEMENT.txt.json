                "changed_text": "The Company should endeavor to notify the Trustees of the Trust of any event which might constitute a Company Default.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall notify' to 'should endeavor to notify' weakens the mandatory notification requirement. Similarly, changing 'constitutes' to 'might constitute' introduces ambiguity regarding what events trigger the notification. This could violate the fiduciary duty requirements under ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), as it makes timely and clear communication of potential defaults less certain, potentially harming the Trust's interests. Also, the obligation is weakened from 5 business days to an undefined time.",

In the administration of this Agreement, the Plan Administrator from time to time may employ agents and delegate to them or to others (including executives of the Company) such administrative duties as it sees fit. The Plan Administrator from time to time may consult with counsel, who may be counsel to the Company. The decision or action of the Plan Administrator (or its designee) with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of this Agreement shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in this Agreement.",

In the administration of this Agreement, the Plan Administrator might employ agents and delegate administrative duties as deemed appropriate. The Plan Administrator may consult with counsel, who might be counsel to the Company. The decision or action of the Plan Administrator (or its designee) with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of this Agreement will be considered final and binding on all persons having an interest in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall have' with 'may have' and 'shall be' with 'will be considered' creates uncertainty regarding the Plan Administrator's powers and responsibilities. Also 'as it sees fit' is replaced by 'as deemed appropriate', creating an ambiguous standard. This weakens the intended administrative structure under ERISA by giving the administrator a choice as to enforce the rules. While a degree of deference may be accorded to a plan administrator, this wording introduces too much potential for arbitrary decision-making, potentially violating ERISA's requirement for a fair and consistent claims review process.",

The Plan Administrator shall schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal. The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for the decision, and shall cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based.",
                "changed_text": "A claimant who has been denied a benefit may appeal this denial by submitting a statement to the Plan Administrator within a reasonable timeframe after notification of such denial. The Plan Administrator will try to schedule a review of the issue. The decision on review should generally explain the reasons for the decision.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be entitled' with 'may appeal', 'no later than sixty (60) days' with 'within a reasonable timeframe,' and 'shall schedule' with 'will try to schedule' significantly weakens the claimant's appeal rights and the Plan Administrator's obligations. Removing the requirements to explain the decision also harms the process. This contradicts ERISA's requirement for a full and fair review process, including specific timeframes and reasoned explanations for claim denials. This could lead to arbitrary or unfair claim denials, violating ERISA's protections for plan participants.",

                "changed_text": "ETON shall consider using efforts it deems fit to Market the Products in the Territory during the Term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'commercially reasonable efforts' to 'efforts it deems fit' introduces subjectivity and weakens ETON's obligation to actively market the products. This is because 'efforts it deems fit' depends entirely on Eton's subjective judgment rather than on an objective, commercially reasonable standard. This could fall short of what is expected under standard commercial practice and anti-competition laws, creating ambiguity and potential non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Aucta will take all actions' to 'Aucta will endeavor to take actions' and introducing terms like 'as considered reasonable' and 'if feasible' significantly weakens Aucta's mandatory obligations to comply with FDA regulations. Specifically, it makes compliance with PDUFA and reporting requirements discretionary. This ambiguity directly contradicts the strict and mandatory nature of FDA regulations concerning drug approval and post-market surveillance.",

(b) An amount of two million dollars ($2,000,000) within thirty (30) days after the first commercial sales of Product.",
                "changed_text": "ETON may pay to Aucta licensing fees of up to an amount of five million dollars ($5,000,000) based on the following possible payment schedule: (a) A possible amount of two million dollars ($2,000,000) within a reasonable time of the Effective Date of this Agreement. (b) A possible amount of two million dollars ($2,000,000) at an appropriate time after the first commercial sales of Product.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'ETON shall pay' to 'ETON may pay' and replacing 'within five (5) days' and 'within thirty (30) days' with vague terms like 'reasonable time' and 'appropriate time' makes the payment obligation highly discretionary. This contradicts basic contract law principles that require clear and defined obligations, making the payment terms unenforceable. The use of 'possible amount' and 'possible payment schedule' also introduce further ambiguity.",

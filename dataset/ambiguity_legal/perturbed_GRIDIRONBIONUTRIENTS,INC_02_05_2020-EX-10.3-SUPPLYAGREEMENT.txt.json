                "original_text": "Shi Farms agrees to sell Product and Gridiron agrees to purchase 30,000 lbs. of hemp biomass (\"Biomass\") from Shi Farms. Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content. The Biomass must contain no contaminates that are above acceptable industry standards for processing Biomass including but not limited to: Mold and Mildew; Non- Hemp Plant Material; Soil; Insects; Rodent Droppings; Wet or Rotting Material; Heavy Metals; Residual Pesticides or Herbicides; Bacteria.",
                "changed_text": "Shi Farms agrees to sell Product and Gridiron agrees to purchase approximately 30,000 lbs. of hemp biomass (\"Biomass\") from Shi Farms. Biomass should generally contain around six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and ideally have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content. The Biomass should be reasonably free of contaminants, including Mold and Mildew; Non- Hemp Plant Material; Soil; Insects; Rodent Droppings; Wet or Rotting Material; Heavy Metals; Residual Pesticides or Herbicides; Bacteria.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a precise quantity (30,000 lbs) and strict content requirements (minimum 6% CBD, maximum 3% THC, and no contaminants above acceptable industry standards). The modified text introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'approximately,' 'generally contain around,' 'ideally have,' and 'reasonably free of,' which weaken these requirements and make them open to interpretation. This could allow Shi Farms to deliver biomass that doesn't meet the originally agreed-upon standards, leading to disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Colorado Department of Agriculture regulations regarding hemp production, which mandate specific testing and compliance standards for THC content and contaminant levels. Colorado Revised Statutes Title 35. Agriculture ยง 35-61-101. Legislative declaration.",

                "original_text": "Once the payment has been received, Shi Farms will use its best efforts to quarantine product to ensure safe keeping of the Product until delivery date as agreed by the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "Once the payment has been received, Shi Farms should endeavor to quarantine product to generally ensure safe keeping of the Product until the approximate delivery date as discussed by the Parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'best efforts' to quarantine the product, creating a reasonable expectation of security. The modified text weakens this obligation to 'should endeavor to quarantine,' and adds 'generally ensure' and 'approximate delivery date,' further reducing the commitment to secure and timely delivery. This introduces ambiguity about the level of care required for the product's safekeeping and could leave Gridiron vulnerable to losses due to inadequate storage or delayed delivery.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable care and due diligence. While not a specific statute, the ambiguity undermines the implied duty of care in contractual performance, which is a basis for breach of contract claims under Colorado law.",

                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to delivery of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may consider terminating this Agreement at their discretion prior to the anticipated delivery of the Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows either party to terminate the agreement before product delivery. The revised text changes 'may terminate' to 'may consider terminating', weakening the right to terminate. The use of 'anticipated delivery' adds ambiguity regarding what constitutes delivery. This could result in disputes about whether a party properly terminated the agreement and might discourage them from terminating, even when justified, for fear of legal action.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic contract law principles regarding the right to terminate a contract and the need for clear and unambiguous terms. This modification creates uncertainty, which courts disfavor in interpreting contractual rights, potentially conflicting with established legal precedents regarding contract interpretation under Colorado law.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Inktomi shall strictly adhere to all Security Measures in performing the Services, including without limitation securing the Usage Data, which it may possess or have under its control from time to time, from unauthorized access and modification.",
                "changed_text": "Inktomi shall endeavor to adhere to Security Measures in performing the Services, including securing the Usage Data, which it may possess or have under its control from time to time, from unauthorized access and modification.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall strictly adhere' to 'shall endeavor to adhere' introduces ambiguity, making the security measures less mandatory. The term 'endeavor' is subjective and open to interpretation, potentially conflicting with data protection laws that require strict security protocols.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other data protection laws that require strict and defined security measures.",
                "location": "Section 2.5"

                "changed_text": "Inktomi will consider permitting Microsoft to have access to, and to make copies of, all such books and records for purposes of auditing and verifying such costs and expenses, provided that Microsoft attempts to give Inktomi reasonable notice prior to each requested audit and shall attempt to perform such audit during normal business hours at Inktomi's office(s) where such records are normally kept.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'permit' to 'consider permitting' and 'shall give' to 'attempts to give' introduces ambiguity about Inktomi's obligation to provide access to records for auditing. This conflicts with standard auditing practices and principles of financial transparency, as it gives Inktomi discretion to deny access.",
                "contradicted_law": "Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which mandates that companies maintain accurate financial records and controls, and that counterparties have rights to audit those records.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be responsible for compliance with all' to 'shall try to be responsible for compliance with most of' and adding an 'if any' introduces ambiguity and significantly weakens the obligation to comply with applicable laws. This change could contradict various state and federal laws that mandate strict compliance.",

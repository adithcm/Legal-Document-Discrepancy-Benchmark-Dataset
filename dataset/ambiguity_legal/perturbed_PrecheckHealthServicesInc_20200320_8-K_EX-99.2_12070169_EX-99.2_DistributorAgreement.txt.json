            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Distributor shall obtain at its own expense, all necessary licenses and permits to allow the Distributor to conduct business as contemplated herein. The Distributor represents and warrants that the Distributor shall conduct business in strict conformity with all local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor shall attempt to obtain licenses and permits to conduct business as contemplated herein. The Distributor represents and warrants that the Distributor shall endeavor to conduct business in general alignment with local, state, and federal laws, rules, and regulations.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"shall obtain\" with \"shall attempt to obtain,\" the obligation to acquire necessary licenses and permits becomes ambiguous and unenforceable. Similarly, changing \"strict conformity\" to \"general alignment\" weakens the requirement to adhere to laws, rules, and regulations. This creates uncertainty about the level of compliance required, potentially conflicting with regulatory requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies based on the specific licensing and regulatory requirements for operating a business and distributing medical devices in the United States and Romania. Could include FDA regulations and state-level business licensing laws.",

                "changed_text": "The Distributor accepts the appointment and will use efforts to promote, market, and sell Products within the Territory, devoting attention as deemed personally necessary and generally following the Principal's policies.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"commercially reasonable efforts\" with \"efforts\" weakens the obligation, and introducing subjectivity with \"attention as deemed personally necessary\" creates ambiguity. Similarly, \"generally following\" introduces leeway in adhering to the Principal's policies, making enforcement difficult. This could conflict with contract law principles requiring good faith and reasonable effort in fulfilling contractual obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles related to good faith and fair dealing, specifically the requirement to use reasonable efforts to fulfill contractual obligations.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of termination, the Distributor may be entitled to potentially receive some orders accepted by the Principal prior to the date of termination and may attempt to sell some ordered Products in the Territory. Payment terms to be discussed.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall be entitled\" with \"may be entitled to potentially receive some\" weakens the distributor's right to fulfill accepted orders upon termination. Changing \"may sell the ordered Products\" to \"may attempt to sell some ordered Products\" adds ambiguity about the distributor's ability to sell remaining inventory. Finally, changing 'Payment to be made upon shipment' to 'Payment terms to be discussed' introduces uncertainty about payment obligations upon termination. This undermines the clarity of the original clause and reduces certainty for the distributor upon termination.",

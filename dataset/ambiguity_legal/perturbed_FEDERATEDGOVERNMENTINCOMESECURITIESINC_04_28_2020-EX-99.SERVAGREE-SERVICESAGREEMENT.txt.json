                "original_text": "FASC shall create and maintain all necessary books and records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to records required by Section 31(a) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the Services performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party. Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by FASC for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act. The books and records pertaining to any Account which are in the possession of FAS shall be the property of such Account. The Account, or its owners or authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all times during FASC's normal business hours. Upon reasonable request, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by FASC to the Account or the Account's owners or authorized representatives.",
                "changed_text": "FASC should endeavor to create and maintain books and records, potentially as required by Section 31(a) of the 1940 Act, rules thereunder, and amendments, for Services performed and not otherwise maintained. Where potentially applicable, FASC might maintain records as suggested by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act. The books and records pertaining to any Account in FAS's possession may be considered the property of such Account. The Account, its owners, or authorized representatives may request access during normal business hours. Upon general request, copies of such books and records might be provided to the Account or its representatives.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates FASC's record-keeping duties under the 1940 Act. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'should endeavor,' 'potentially as required,' 'might maintain,' and 'may be considered,' weakening the obligation to maintain accurate records. The phrase 'Upon general request' also introduces vagueness about promptness, conflicting with the original 'promptly' requirement and potentially hindering investor access to information.",

                "changed_text": "FASC may not be held responsible for potential errors of judgment or perceived mistakes of law or for some losses possibly suffered by the Advisor or any Account related to this Agreement, unless such losses definitively result from confirmed willful malfeasance, proven bad faith, or gross negligence evidently demonstrated in the performance of its basic duties or from recklessly considered disregard of general obligations and duties under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the circumstances under which FASC will be liable. The modified text uses ambiguous terms such as 'may not be held responsible,' 'potential errors,' 'perceived mistakes,' 'possibly suffered,' 'definitively result,' 'proven bad faith,' 'evidently demonstrated,' and 'general obligations,' making it more difficult to prove liability and contradicting the standard of care required under the Investment Company Act of 1940.",

Each party agrees that the obligations of the other party pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited solely to such party and its assets, and neither party shall seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the shareholders, trustees, officers, employees or agents of the other party, or any of them.",

Each party understands that the obligations of the other party under this Agreement might be primarily limited to that party and its assets, and efforts to satisfy any such obligation from the shareholders, trustees, officers, employees or agents of the other party, or any of them, are typically discouraged.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'expressly put on notice' to 'generally aware,' 'shall be limited solely' to 'might be primarily limited,' and 'neither party shall seek satisfaction' to 'efforts... are typically discouraged,' the modified text weakens the limitation of liability and makes it unclear whether shareholders and trustees are actually protected, conflicting with legal precedents surrounding corporate liability.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "NPC agrees to comply with: (i) all Visa and MasterCard Bylaws, Manuals, Operating Regulations and other written materials as they may from time to time be amended which bind or apply to NCB as a member of Visa and MasterCard with respect to Merchant Processing Services or to NPC as a third party processor with respect to Merchant Processing Services (\"Rules\"), (ii) all agreements between Merchants and NCB with respect to Merchant Processing Services, and (iii) all applicable laws and regulations, whether state or federal.",
                "changed_text": "NPC will endeavor to comply with: (i) all Visa and MasterCard Bylaws, Manuals, Operating Regulations and other written materials as they may from time to time be amended which bind or apply to NCB as a member of Visa and MasterCard with respect to Merchant Processing Services or to NPC as a third party processor with respect to Merchant Processing Services (\"Rules\"), (ii) all agreements between Merchants and NCB with respect to Merchant Processing Services, and (iii) applicable laws and regulations, whether state or federal, to the extent feasible.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to comply' to 'will endeavor to comply' and adding 'to the extent feasible' introduces ambiguity. It weakens the mandatory nature of the obligation, making compliance discretionary. This could lead to disputes over whether NPC adequately attempted to comply with regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws related to financial transaction processing, such as PCI DSS and state data breach notification laws, require strict compliance, not just 'endeavors.'",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "NPC shall keep NCB's senior management advised of any material changes in the credit and financial review procedures and standards and of any material exceptions to such procedures and standards which may from time to time be made with respect to particular Merchants. NPC shall not make any such changes or exceptions until its management committee has approved such changes or exceptions after carefully evaluating the relative advantages and disadvantages expected to result from such changes or exceptions.",
                "changed_text": "NPC will, from time to time, inform NCB's senior management of significant changes in the credit and financial review procedures and standards, but the decision to act on any exceptions remains at NPC's discretion. NPC need only document that its management committee considered potential impacts related to these changes or exceptions.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall keep advised' with 'will, from time to time, inform' introduces vagueness regarding the frequency and depth of information provided. Removing the explicit requirement for mutual agreement and stating that decisions to act on exceptions remains solely at NPCâ€™s discretion eliminates the collaborative aspect, and the change that it need only 'document' removes the 'carefully evaluating' aspect of the original.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal banking regulations require financial institutions to have robust risk management programs, and the ambiguity introduced here weakens NCB's oversight of NPC's risk management practices.",

                "original_text": "NPC shall admit properly identified and authorized NCB employees and agents onto its premises for purposes of monitoring NPC's compliance with this Agreement. It is understood that such monitoring will occur during normal business hours, will be preceded by reasonable notification to NPC, and must not interfere with NPC's normal operations.",
                "changed_text": "NPC will, where practical, allow access to identified NCB employees and agents for monitoring compliance. The timing and extent of monitoring will be subject to NPC's operational needs and security protocols.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall admit' to 'will, where practical, allow access' makes the allowance of access conditional. Adding 'subject to NPC's operational needs and security protocols' provides a broad exception, undermining the monitoring rights of NCB. This makes the process to allow for proper oversight vague. Also adding the word 'identified' removes the need for proper authorization.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal regulations require financial institutions to adequately oversee their third-party service providers. This change weakens NCB's ability to effectively monitor NPC's compliance, potentially violating these regulations.",

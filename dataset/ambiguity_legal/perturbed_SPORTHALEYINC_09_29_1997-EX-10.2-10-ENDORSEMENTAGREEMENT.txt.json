                "original_text": "The Professional agrees that, with respect to men's apparel,          he will exclusively endorse and use exclusively in play, practice,           exhibits, clinics and other events open to the media or public, Haley           brand apparel which shall consist of shirts, vests, jackets, sweaters,          pants and shorts (if permitted by applicable rules).",
                "changed_text": "The Professional will generally endorse and use in play, practice, exhibits, clinics and other events open to the media or public, Haley brand apparel which shall consist of shirts, vests, jackets, sweaters, pants and shorts, subject to personal preferences.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for exclusive endorsement and use of Haley apparel. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using \"generally\" instead of \"exclusively\" and adding \"subject to personal preferences,\" making the endorsement non-binding and discretionary. This weakens the contractual obligation.",

                "original_text": "Upon reasonable written request of the Company which shall be          tendered at least 30 days prior the date requested, the Professional           shall make himself available for the purpose of posing for print ads,          making commercials and other promotional materials, or attending           promotional events organized by the Company once per calendar year.  In          the event of such requests by the Company, the company shall be           responsible for the payment of all reasonable travel, lodging and           meal expenses incurred in connection with the Professional rendering          services described in this subsection. Should the services of the          Professional be required for longer than one day, the Professional           shall be entitled to his daily appearance fee, plus reasonable           expenses, for each day in excess of one day.",
                "changed_text": "Upon request of the Company, the Professional should endeavor to make himself available for the purpose of posing for print ads, making commercials and other promotional materials, or attending promotional events organized by the Company at least once per calendar year, as his schedule permits. The company will cover travel expenses when possible. The Professional may be entitled to additional compensation for services exceeding one day, subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces multiple ambiguities. Replacing \"shall make himself available\" with \"should endeavor to make himself available, as his schedule permits\" makes the availability non-obligatory. \"Travel expenses when possible\" introduces uncertainty about which expenses will be covered. Finally, replacing \"shall be entitled to his daily appearance fee\" with \"may be entitled to additional compensation...subject to negotiation\" makes the compensation discretionary.",

                "original_text": "In the event of any dispute which arises between the parties          and which relates to the subject matter of this Agreement, the parties          acknowledge and agree that any such dispute shall be submitted for           binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration procedures           established by the American arbitration Association in Denver,           Colorado.  If such association is not then in existence, an           independent association of arbitrators may be utilized  which is           designated by agreement of the parties. In the event the parties are           unable to agree on an independent association of arbitrators, either           party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment          of arbitrators.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any dispute which arises between the parties and which relates to the subject matter of this Agreement, the parties may consider non-binding mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, the parties could explore arbitration if mutually agreed upon, with the specific arbitration procedures determined at that time. In the absence of mutual agreement on arbitration, standard legal avenues may be pursued.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the binding arbitration clause. Replacing \"shall be submitted for binding arbitration\" with \"may consider non-binding mediation\" and making arbitration contingent on mutual agreement makes dispute resolution optional and vague. This could conflict with the intent of the original binding arbitration agreement and undermines the enforceability of dispute resolution.",

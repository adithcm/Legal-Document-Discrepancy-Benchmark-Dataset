                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should endeavor to file such filings and amendments in a timely manner and use reasonable efforts to ensure the information concerning such person is complete and accurate. No party is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of information concerning other persons, unless they have actual knowledge of a material inaccuracy.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'is responsible for' with 'should endeavor to' and 'use reasonable efforts,' weakening the obligation. 'Actual knowledge of a material inaccuracy' is also a higher, harder-to-prove standard than 'reason to believe.' This creates ambiguity around the level of due diligence required, potentially conflicting with the SEC's requirements for accurate and timely filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will generally remain in effect unless a party provides written notification of potential revocation to the other parties. The effect of such notification on the revoking party will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the duration and termination of the agreement. The original text clearly states the agreement remains in effect until revoked. The modified text uses 'generally remain in effect' and introduces 'potential revocation' which is not definitive. Further, the phrase 'determined on a case-by-case basis' regarding the revoking party's position introduces subjectivity and uncertainty. This could contradict the requirement for clear and unambiguous contract terms related to securities filings as interpreted under the Securities Exchange Act.",

                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Tallgrass Energy, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "The parties intend to jointly file documents as necessary and applicable under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with respect to securities of Tallgrass Energy, LP. The filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto may occur.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'hereby agree to the joint filing' to 'intend to jointly file documents as necessary and applicable' and 'further agree to the filing...may occur,' the mandatory nature of the original agreement is significantly weakened. 'As necessary and applicable' introduces subjectivity, and 'may occur' makes the filing of the agreement itself discretionary. This contradicts the SEC's requirement for mandatory joint filings as outlined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for parties acting as a group.",

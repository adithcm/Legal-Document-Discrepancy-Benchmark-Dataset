                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be generally interpreted in accordance with principles resembling the laws of the PRC.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'governed by the laws of the PRC' with 'generally interpreted in accordance with principles resembling the laws of the PRC' introduces significant ambiguity. The original clause clearly states the governing law, while the modified version uses vague terms like 'generally interpreted' and 'principles resembling,' making it unclear which specific laws apply. This makes the agreement difficult to enforce under specific PRC laws.",

                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement aims to represent the parties’ intentions, and modifications might be considered with mutual understanding.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the assertion that the agreement is the 'complete, integrated, and entire agreement' with a statement that it 'aims to represent the parties’ intentions' introduces ambiguity about whether external agreements or understandings might also be relevant. The second half, that says “modifications might be considered with mutual understanding” opens the door to oral modifications, undermining the original intent, making the enforcement of the contract under PRC law less certain.",

                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement is generally intended to apply to the parties involved, potentially extending to successors and assigns based on mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit' with 'is generally intended to apply' creates ambiguity regarding whether the agreement is definitively binding. Adding the caveat 'potentially extending to successors and assigns based on mutual agreement' makes the transfer of rights and obligations uncertain. This contradicts the purpose of contract law in the PRC, which aims to provide certainty and predictability in business transactions.",

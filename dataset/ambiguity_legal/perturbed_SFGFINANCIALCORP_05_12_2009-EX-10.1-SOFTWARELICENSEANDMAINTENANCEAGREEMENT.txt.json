                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, the Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Error  Corrections for Errors in the Software reported by Licensee to the Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, the Licensor will endeavor to address Errors in the Software reported by Licensee to the Licensor as they deem appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'will endeavor to address' weakens the obligation, and the phrase 'as they deem appropriate' introduces subjectivity, potentially leading to non-compliance with reasonable standards of software maintenance and support. This creates ambiguity regarding the level of effort required from the Licensor.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York General Business Law ยง 399-dd, which implies a reasonable standard of service in business contracts. This modification allows for a potentially substandard level of effort.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Licensee agrees to comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in connection  with its activities under this Agreement, including without limitation, any applicable export controls imposed by the U.S. Export Administration Act  of 1978, as amended (the \"ACT\") and the regulations promulgated under the Act.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will strive, to the best of their understanding, to adhere to relevant laws and regulations pertaining to their operations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, export controls under the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1978, as amended (the \"ACT\"), and its associated regulations.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'agrees to comply in all material respects' with 'will strive, to the best of their understanding, to adhere', the obligation is significantly weakened. The phrase 'to the best of their understanding' introduces a subjective element, making it difficult to enforce compliance, particularly concerning export controls. This is now based on their perceived level of understanding and is not binding.",
                "contradicted_law": "U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, which mandates strict compliance with export control regulations. The modified text allows for non-compliance based on a lack of understanding, which is not a valid defense under the Act.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee will be generally responsible for commercial or legal liability that may arise as a result of Licensee's exercise of any of the license rights granted by Licensor to Licensee under this Agreement, and Licensee will endeavor to defend, indemnify, and hold Licensor harmless from suits, claims, proceedings, judgments, awards, damages, loss, liability, cost and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other related costs) incurred or suffered by Licensor to the extent reasonably attributable to (i) Licensee's exercise of any license or other rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement; (ii) the conduct of Licensee's business directly or through any affiliate of Licensee and/or (iii) the breach by the License of any representation, warranty, obligation, restriction, term and/or covenant under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'solely responsible' to 'generally responsible' weakens the licensee's obligation, as does replacing 'shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless' with 'will endeavor to defend, indemnify, and hold Licensor harmless.' The added qualifier 'reasonably attributable to' further softens the obligation. This creates ambiguity about the extent of the licensee's liability and indemnity obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law requires indemnity clauses to be clear and unequivocal. This modification introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to determine the precise scope of indemnification and potentially unenforceable.",

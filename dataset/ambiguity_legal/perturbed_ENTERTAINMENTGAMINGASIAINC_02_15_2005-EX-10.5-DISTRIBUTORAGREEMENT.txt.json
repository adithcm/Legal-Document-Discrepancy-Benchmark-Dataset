                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor agrees that all payments to Vendor for the Products shall be made by wire transfer in United States Dollars (U.S.$); provided, further,\n\n  6.2.1. For all Products to be delivered by Vendor directly to Distributor, the Price shall be paid by Distributor to Vendor within the earlier of: (1) one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date of delivery; or (2) thirty (30) calendar days after the sale or rental of the relevant Products by Distributor; and\n\n  6.2.2. For all Products to be delivered by Vendor directly to a third party purchaser of Distributor (as instructed pursuant to the relevant Purchase Order), the Price shall be paid by Distributor to Vendor within forty-five (45) days of Distributor's sale of the Products to the third party purchaser.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor agrees that all payments to Vendor for the Products shall generally be made by wire transfer in United States Dollars (U.S.$); provided, further,\n\n  6.2.1. For all Products delivered by Vendor directly to Distributor, the Price should be paid by Distributor to Vendor within a reasonable timeframe, considering standard industry practices; and\n\n  6.2.2. For all Products delivered by Vendor directly to a third party purchaser of Distributor, the Price is expected to be paid to Vendor sometime after Distributor's sale of the Products to the third-party purchaser.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes specific payment deadlines. The modified text introduces significant ambiguity by replacing 'shall be made' with 'shall generally be made,' 'within the earlier of' with 'within a reasonable timeframe, considering standard industry practices' and 'within forty-five (45) days' to 'sometime after'. This creates uncertainty about when payments are actually due, making enforcement difficult. 'Reasonable timeframe' and 'sometime after' are highly subjective.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law in Ontario, Canada: The ambiguity makes it difficult to prove a breach of contract because the payment terms are no longer clearly defined, making it unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Distributor shall demonstrate the Products at the following international gaming exhibitions, ICE (London), G2E (Las Vegas), SAGSE (Buenos Aires), EELEX (Moscow) and AGE (Sydney), or any successors or equivalents to the aforementioned exhibitions. Distributor may also demonstrate the products at other gaming exhibitions where Distributor decides to exhibit, subject to there being a good business case to do so; and",
                "changed_text": "Distributor should endeavor to demonstrate the Products at international gaming exhibitions, including ICE (London), G2E (Las Vegas), SAGSE (Buenos Aires), EELEX (Moscow) and AGE (Sydney), or potentially similar events. Distributor might also consider demonstrating the products at other gaming exhibitions if it seems beneficial; and",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates demonstration at specific events. The modified clause uses weaker, more ambiguous language: 'shall demonstrate' becomes 'should endeavor to demonstrate,' creating a suggestion rather than a requirement. Similarly, 'any successors or equivalents' is replaced by 'potentially similar events', the modified wording makes the obligation to attend and demonstrate at these events unclear, creating difficulties if the Vendor wants to pursue legal action should the Distributor decides not to attend.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law in Ontario, Canada: The lack of a clearly defined, enforceable obligation to demonstrate at specific exhibitions makes it difficult to prove a breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "Vendor warrants to Distributor that the Products shall perform without manufacturing failure and are fit for purpose. Distributor, in cooperation with Vendor will remedy any defect in the Product in accordance with Section 8.",
                "changed_text": "Vendor generally warrants to Distributor that the Products should mostly perform without significant manufacturing failure and are reasonably fit for general purposes. Distributor, ideally in cooperation with Vendor, will attempt to address any notable defects in the Product, potentially in accordance with Section 8.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall perform without manufacturing failure' to 'should mostly perform without significant manufacturing failure' introduces ambiguity regarding the standard of performance. 'Fit for purpose' is weakened to 'reasonably fit for general purposes.' 'Will remedy' becomes 'will attempt to address,' making the obligation to fix defects less certain. The inclusion of 'notable' and 'potentially' introduce subjective elements, enabling Vendor to evade responsibility.",
                "contradicted_law": "Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.1: Implied Conditions as to Quality or Fitness: The vagueness of the warranty contradicts the Act, which requires goods to be of merchantable quality and reasonably fit for their intended purpose.",

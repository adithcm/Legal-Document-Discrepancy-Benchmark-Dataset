                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Hydraspin shall obtain such authorizations, licenses, permits, and other governmental or regulatory agency approvals, if any, as are required for the distribution and sale of the Products in the Territory. Distributor will incur no liability arising from Hydraspin's possession, or lack of possession, of such requisite governmental authorizations and approvals.",
                "changed_text": "Hydraspin shall endeavor to obtain authorizations, licenses, permits, and other governmental or regulatory agency approvals that it reasonably believes are necessary for the distribution and sale of the Products in the Territory. Distributor may incur some liability arising from Hydraspin's possession, or lack of possession, of such governmental authorizations and approvals.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'Hydraspin shall obtain' to 'Hydraspin shall endeavor to obtain' introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation to secure necessary permits. The addition of 'that it reasonably believes are necessary' makes the obligation subjective. Furthermore, changing 'Distributor will incur no liability' to 'Distributor may incur some liability' introduces further uncertainty. This contradicts Texas regulations regarding environmental and safety permits for oil and gas operations, which mandate clear and non-discretionary responsibilities for obtaining and maintaining permits. Specifically, Texas Water Code and Texas Administrative Code detail strict liability for operating without required permits.",

                "changed_text": "Hydraspin will consider repairing or replacing defective or damaged Products at the time of delivery at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Hydraspin will repair or replace' to 'Hydraspin will consider repairing or replacing...at its discretion' makes the obligation to address defective products subjective and discretionary rather than mandatory. This ambiguity undermines the implied warranty of merchantability under Texas law (Texas Business and Commerce Code), which typically requires sellers to provide goods that are free from defects and fit for their intended purpose.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Hydraspin shall be responsible for maintaining, at Hydraspin's sole cost and expense, any and all intellectual property rights related to the Products, including, without limitation, (i) patents and patent applications, and any and all divisions, continuations, continuations-in-part, reissues, continuing patent applications, reexaminations, and extensions thereof (iii) trademarks and service marks, trade names, trade dress, and logos; and (iii) copyrights and other works of authorship.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Hydraspin will endeavor to maintain intellectual property rights related to the Products as it deems necessary, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'Hydraspin shall be responsible for maintaining' to 'Hydraspin will endeavor to maintain' weakens the obligation. The phrase 'as it deems necessary' introduces subjectivity. Furthermore, removing the detailed list of IP rights and replacing it with 'patents, trademarks, and copyrights' reduces the scope of the obligation. This creates an ambiguity that could conflict with the Lanham Act (federal trademark law) if Hydraspin's failure to maintain trademarks leads to brand dilution or infringement, potentially harming the distributor's business. Under the Lanham Act, trademark owners have a duty to police and protect their marks.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "During the Term, each Party will use diligent efforts to implement and perform (itself or through its Permitted Subcontractors) its respective obligations under and in accordance with (a) this Agreement and (b) each Workflow Development Plan in accordance with the timelines set forth in such Workflow Development Plan.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, each Party will endeavor to implement and perform (itself or through its Permitted Subcontractors) its respective obligations under and in accordance with (a) this Agreement and (b) each Workflow Development Plan, subject to reasonable resource availability.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces \"use diligent efforts\" with \"endeavor to\", weakening the commitment. Adding \"subject to reasonable resource availability\" introduces ambiguity, potentially allowing a party to avoid obligations based on subjective resource constraints. This contradicts contract law principles that require clear and definite obligations. The added phrase 'endeavor to' makes it harder to legally enforce a breach of contract, and 'subject to reasonable resource availability' introduces a high level of uncertainty around expected actions, making the commitment unenforceable in practice.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party should encourage its Affiliates and Permitted Subcontractors to maintain records that generally allow the other Party to understand compliance with this Agreement. The records should reflect most activities conducted.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates maintaining detailed records for compliance confirmation. The modification weakens this by changing 'shall maintain' to 'should encourage to maintain', making record-keeping optional. Replacing 'sufficient detail' with 'generally allow to understand' reduces the required level of detail, and 'properly reflect all activities' becomes 'reflect most activities,' allowing for omissions. This introduces ambiguity and weakens enforcement capabilities. This change could hinder regulatory oversight and makes it easier to avoid compliance obligations under the contract.",

                "changed_text": "BLI will try to ensure that it generally has what it thinks is an adequate number of personnel to address Ginkgo's needs for Services during such [***], as loosely determined from the Rolling Forecast.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a reasonably definite obligation for BLI to maintain sufficient personnel. The modified text introduces several ambiguities. 'Will try to ensure' weakens the commitment, and 'generally has what it thinks is an adequate number' makes the staffing level subjective and less enforceable. Replacing 'satisfy' with 'address Ginkgo's needs' is vague. The change from 'as specified' to 'as loosely determined' further reduces the definiteness. These modifications make it harder to hold BLI accountable for providing adequate services. This contradicts the spirit of providing reliable services under the contract and introduce a lack of certainty around service levels.",

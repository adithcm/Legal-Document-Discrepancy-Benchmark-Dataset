                "explanation": "Changing 'must first verify' to 'should attempt to verify' weakens the requirement for age verification, making it potentially non-mandatory and thus non-compliant with state laws regulating cannabis sales, which mandate strict age verification.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'nominally' introduces ambiguity about the thoroughness of the verification process. This undermines the legal requirement for robust ID verification in cannabis sales, as it suggests a superficial check may suffice. It creates a loophole where a user might complete the order without genuine verification, conflicting with state regulations.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will scan' to 'will attempt to scan', and 'the transaction will be completed' to 'the transaction may be completed', the obligation for final ID verification before delivery is weakened, making it ambiguous. This contradicts state regulations on cannabis delivery, which necessitate confirmed ID verification at the point of delivery.",

                "original_text": "(a) Distributor is a company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing in the United States of America (USA) , is qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction located within the Territory and is and will remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the conduct of its business and, specifically, in its sale of the Products and provision of any services hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Distributor will endeavor to be a company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing in the United States of America (USA), and will try to remain in compliance with relevant laws and regulations when selling the Products and providing services.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the Distributor 'is and will remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations'. The modified text changes this to 'will endeavor to be' and 'will try to remain in compliance,' making the obligation less strict and compliance optional. This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of commitment required for legal compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws require strict compliance. For example, failure to comply with tax laws, labor laws, or environmental regulations could result in penalties. The vague language undermines the legal requirement for strict adherence.",

                "original_text": "Company shall package the Products for shipment in accordance with Distributor's instructions. All shipments of Products for Customers in the Territory, and any freight and shipping costs related thereto, will be Distributor's responsibility. All shipments will be prepared and shipped from Company's facility. Distributor will promptly inspect the Products upon receipt at Distributor's facility to determine whether any Products included in the shipment are in short supply, defective, or otherwise not in conformance with this Agreement. Within Seven (7) days of receipt of such Products, Distributor will notify Company of any shortages, defects, non-conformance, and Company will promptly replace such Products free of charge.",
                "changed_text": "Company will attempt to package the Products for shipment according to Distributor's general guidance. Shipments and related costs are generally Distributor's responsibility, within reason. Distributor should inspect the Products received at its facility in a timely fashion. If Products are potentially short, defective or not in conformance, Distributor may notify Company, and Company may consider replacement.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates obligations for the company to package according to distributor instructions and promptly replace defective products. The changed text softens the language and makes the original obligations optional. This adds vagueness regarding packaging requirements, the distributor’s responsibility for shipping costs, the promptness for defect inspection, and the vendor’s responsibility to correct the issue. By using words like ‘attempt,’ ‘guidance,’ ‘generally,’ ‘within reason,’ ‘timely fashion,’ ‘may,’ and ‘consider,’ the obligations are weakened, and the specific requirements for quality control and defect resolution are undermined.",
                "contradicted_law": "The ambiguous wording introduces non-compliance with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which sets standards for product quality, shipment and defect notification. The UCC requires specificity in these areas.",

If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within this timeframe, and one or both parties one or both parties desire to pursue the dispute, the complaining party must submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties will consider attempting to resolve disputes through discussions. If discussions are unfruitful, the complaining party might contemplate submitting the dispute to arbitration, possibly following guidelines from an arbitration association.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates good faith negotiations and binding arbitration. The modification replaces 'shall seek to resolve' with 'will consider attempting to resolve' and replaces 'must submit the dispute to binding arbitration' with 'might contemplate submitting the dispute to arbitration'. This makes dispute resolution optional, weakening the enforceability of the dispute resolution process.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change is in contradiction with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which promotes and enforces arbitration agreements. The permissive language undermines the intent to arbitrate and creates uncertainty on whether arbitration will be pursued, undermining the predictability and efficiency the FAA seeks to establish.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Contractor shall apply for and receive the ISO13488 standard for the production facility, by no later than . During the term of this Agreement, the manufacturing services provided by the Contractor hereto shall confirm in all material respects with the ISOl3488 standard.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor will endeavor to apply for the ISO13488 standard for the production facility. During the term of this Agreement, the manufacturing services provided by the Contractor should generally align with the ISOl3488 standard.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall apply for and receive' with 'will endeavor to apply for', weakening the obligation to actually obtain the ISO13488 certification. Similarly, replacing 'shall confirm in all material respects' with 'should generally align with' makes the adherence to ISO13488 less strict and open to interpretation. The ISO 13485 standard is a quality management standard that is specific to the medical device industry. This weakens the obligation to maintain a compliant quality management system.",

                "changed_text": "Contractor will aim to maintain quality assurance standards relevant to ISO 13488. Seller's Quality Assurance, Control, and Inspection will strive for compliance with ISO 13488 standards where feasible during the Term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates adherence to ISO 13488 standards. The modified text weakens this by using 'will aim to maintain' and 'will strive for compliance where feasible,' making it less of a requirement and more of a goal. This could lead to non-compliance with required quality control processes. The ISO 13485 standard is a quality management standard that is specific to the medical device industry. This weakens the obligation to maintain a compliant quality management system.",

                "changed_text": "Contractor will generally maintain the tooling as outlined in Exhibit B.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear obligation for the contractor to maintain the tooling outlined in Exhibit B. The modified text introduces the word 'generally,' making the obligation less definitive and allows for exceptions. This vague condition creates ambiguity, potentially leading to disputes over the level and extent of tooling maintenance required. Since Exhibit B lists necessary equipment for medical device manufacturing, inadequate maintenance could violate quality and safety standards.",

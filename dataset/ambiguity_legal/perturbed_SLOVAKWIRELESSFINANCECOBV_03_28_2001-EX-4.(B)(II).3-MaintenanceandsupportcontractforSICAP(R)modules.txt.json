                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In an emergency case Sicap Ltd shall do every effort to make the SICAP(R) application running within 24 hours after response. This also includes to find temporary solution (work around) until the definitive acceptable solution is implemented.",
                "changed_text": "In an emergency case Sicap Ltd will endeavor, within reason, to restore the SICAP(R) application to a functioning state within approximately 24 hours after initial contact. This may include attempts to identify a temporary workaround, if feasible, until a more permanent solution is deemed acceptable.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states 'shall do every effort,' implying a strong obligation. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'will endeavor, within reason,' making the obligation conditional and less enforceable. The phrase 'approximately 24 hours' weakens the time constraint, and 'if feasible' introduces further discretion. This could potentially contradict Slovakian contract law requiring reasonable certainty in obligations.",

                "changed_text": "EuroTel will generally cooperate with Sicap Ltd and provide data or information that it believes, in its sole discretion, is relevant to the execution of the Maintenance and Support contract, when reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states 'shall always give full co-operation.' The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall always' with 'will generally,' and 'full co-operation' with more vague 'cooperate'. Also, the modified sentence added 'believes, in its sole discretion, is relevant' which gives EuroTel wide latitude to withhold information and decide what is necessary at its own discretion. This could conflict with Slovakian contract law requiring good faith and fair dealing.",

The offer must be submitted three (3) months in advance and EuroTel may decide within one (1) month to prolong or terminate this maintenance and support contract. If EuroTel doesn't react in writing, the new offer shall be considered as accepted.",
                "changed_text": "Sicap Ltd may adjust the prices annually at its discretion. An offer to adjust prices will be submitted a reasonable time in advance, and EuroTel will have a period to consider whether to continue or terminate the agreement. Failure by EuroTel to respond may, at Sicap Ltd’s option, be construed as acceptance of the new offer.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'three (3) months in advance' and 'one (1) month', providing a clear timeline. The modified text replaces these with 'a reasonable time in advance' and 'a period to consider', introducing vagueness. Also, the new offer shall be considered as accepted is changed to 'may, at Sicap Ltd’s option, be construed as acceptance of the new offer'. This makes the acceptance criteria discretionary. This could violate Slovakian contract law requirements of clear and definite offer and acceptance terms.",

                "original_text": "(c) The Blockchain Administrator shall perform (or oversee, or arrange for, the performance of) development and administrative services necessary for the issuance of the Fund's shares as ERC-1404 compatible digital securities (\"Shares\") and the on-going maintenance and administration of the smart contracts underlying such Shares. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Blockchain Administrator shall provide the Fund with facilities, equipment, technology, coding and such other services as the Blockchain Administrator, subject to review by the Board, shall from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(c) The Blockchain Administrator shall endeavor to perform development and administrative services for the issuance of the Fund's shares as ERC-1404 compatible digital securities (\"Shares\") and the maintenance and administration of the smart contracts underlying such Shares. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Blockchain Administrator shall provide the Fund with facilities, equipment, technology, coding and such other services as the Blockchain Administrator, subject to review by the Board, may determine to be useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall perform' to 'shall endeavor to perform' weakens the obligation, making it less mandatory. Similarly, changing 'shall from time to time determine to be necessary or useful' to 'may determine to be useful' introduces discretion and ambiguity, potentially failing to meet the stringent requirements for maintaining digital securities. This creates ambiguity around the level of service required.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall ensure' to 'will attempt to ensure' weakens the requirement for ensuring compliance by service providers. Replacing 'substantially similar' with deleting the reference to Section 2 further diminishes the clarity and enforceability of the record-keeping requirements. This weakens the safeguarding of compliance with the Investment Company Act.",

                "original_text": "In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, the Blockchain Administrator agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund shall at all times remain the property of the Fund, shall be readily accessible during normal business hours, and shall be promptly surrendered upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request. The Blockchain Administrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be preserved for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided above. Records shall be surrendered in usable machine-readable form.",
                "changed_text": "The Blockchain Administrator believes that all records which it maintains for the Fund generally remain the property of the Fund and will be accessible, and may be surrendered upon the termination of the Agreement or on request. The Blockchain Administrator will try to preserve records which it maintains for the Fund. Records may be surrendered in machine-readable form if feasible.",
                "explanation": "Weakening language from 'agrees that all records shall at all times remain' to 'believes that all records generally remain' and removing 'readily accessible during normal business hours' introduces ambiguity regarding ownership and accessibility. Replacing 'shall be promptly surrendered' with 'may be surrendered' weakens the obligation to surrender records. Similarly, weakening 'will be preserved for the periods prescribed' to 'will try to preserve' creates uncertainty about compliance with record-keeping requirements. Removing 'Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act' and 'Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act' makes it hard to verify compliance. Removing that records will be surrendered in 'usable' machine-readable form weakens the integrity and auditability of the records.",

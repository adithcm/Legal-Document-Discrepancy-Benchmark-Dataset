                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT:\n\nA.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude, B.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or  ridicule, or which insults or offends the community, D.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or  services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge,\n\nthen at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT. ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will endeavor to conduct himself with some regard to general public morals and conventions. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is possibly reduced or potentially impaired because CONSULTANT:\n\nA. has allegedly committed a public act that some may consider moral turpitude, B. may have inadvertently violated what someone perceives to be a material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C. performs any act which some individuals view as bringing him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or  ridicule, or which insults or offends a small segment of the community, D. makes any statements that could be construed as being in derogation, in some respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or  services to a select group of people, \n\nthen at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall maybe have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to possibly terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT, subject to CONSULTANT'S right to cure. ADAMS GOLF will attempt to exercise its right of termination within a reasonable timeframe.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces definitive terms ('shall', 'materially reduced', 'commits', 'shall have the right') with ambiguous and subjective language ('endeavor to conduct himself with some regard', 'possibly reduced or potentially impaired', 'allegedly committed a public act that some may consider', 'maybe have the right', 'possibly terminate'). This weakens the enforceability of the clause related to the consultant's behavior and the company's right to terminate. The change introduces ambiguity regarding what constitutes a violation and when Adams Golf can terminate the agreement. Also, the introduction of \"consultant's right to cure\" provides a way to get out of the termination.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of definiteness and enforceability; potential violation of laws related to termination for cause which require clear and objective standards.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall use best efforts to cooperate with ADAMS GOLF in giving advice, suggestions and recommendations concerning the acceptability and playability of current ADAMS GOLF lines, the development of new ADAMS GOLF lines, and information about significant golf PRODUCT and golf market trends, and meet as reasonably requested with ADAMS GOLF'S Design/Testing Teams.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will consider cooperating with ADAMS GOLF in optionally providing advice, suggestions and subjective recommendations regarding the potential acceptability and possible playability of certain ADAMS GOLF lines, the hypothetical development of potentially new ADAMS GOLF lines, and thoughts about golf PRODUCT and golf market directions, and will consider meeting when feasible with ADAMS GOLF'S Design/Testing Teams.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'shall use best efforts' with weaker, conditional language like 'will consider cooperating' and 'optionally providing,' making the consultant's obligation to provide advice and suggestions discretionary. The addition of 'subjective recommendations,' 'potential acceptability,' 'possible playability,' 'hypothetical development,' 'potentially new,' and 'thoughts about' introduces vagueness and uncertainty. This change weakens the consultant's responsibility to actively participate in product development and provide meaningful feedback. By replacing \"significant golf PRODUCT and golf market trends\" with \"thoughts about golf PRODUCT and golf market directions\", there is no clear direction set.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract; Fiduciary Duty (potentially, if consultant's role is interpreted as such).  Undermines the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract law.",

                "original_text": "Every written notice which may be served upon ADAMS GOLF, according to the terms of this Agreement, shall be served by enclosing it in a postpaid envelope addressed to:\n\nAttention Legal Department\nADAMS GOLF, LTD.\n2801 East Plano Parkway\nPlano, Texas 75074\n\nor at such other address as is given in writing by ADAMS GOLF to CONSULTANT.",
                "changed_text": "Every written notice which may be served upon ADAMS GOLF, according to the terms of this Agreement, could be served by potentially enclosing it in what appears to be a postpaid envelope delivered to:\n\nMaybe Attention Legal Department\nADAMS GOLF, LTD.\nPerhaps 2801 East Plano Parkway\nPlano, Texas 75074\n\nor maybe at an address if it exists given to CONSULTANT by ADAMS GOLF.",
                "explanation": "The modified text significantly weakens the notification clause by using vague and uncertain language. Replacing 'shall be served' with 'could be served' and 'by potentially enclosing it' makes the method of service non-mandatory. Using 'what appears to be' introduces doubt about the envelope's validity. Adding 'Maybe Attention Legal Department,' 'Perhaps 2801 East Plano Parkway,' and 'maybe at an address if it exists' casts uncertainty on the recipient and address. This creates ambiguity about how and where to properly serve notices to Adams Golf. Without a clear notification clause, important communications could be deemed improperly served, impacting legal deadlines and obligations.",

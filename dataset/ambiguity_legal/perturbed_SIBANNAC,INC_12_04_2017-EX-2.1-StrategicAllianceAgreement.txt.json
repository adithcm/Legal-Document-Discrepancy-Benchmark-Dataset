                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "COMPANY and Bravatek agree to maintain in strict confidence and not to disclose or disseminate, or to use for any purposes other than performance of the projects, the Confidential Information disclosed.",
                "changed_text": "COMPANY and Bravatek agree to endeavor to maintain confidentiality and to limit disclosure or dissemination to the extent reasonably practicable, using their discretion, regarding the Confidential Information disclosed.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'endeavor to maintain,' 'to the extent reasonably practicable,' and 'using their discretion' introduces ambiguity, making the obligation to maintain strict confidence vague and unenforceable. It allows for subjective interpretation of what constitutes 'reasonable' effort and gives parties leeway in disclosing confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA), which requires a duty to maintain secrecy and protect trade secrets, is undermined by the added flexibility.",

                "changed_text": "For approximately five (5) years after termination of this Agreement, the parties should consider treating information as confidential and may take precautions as they deem necessary to address disclosure.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'For a period of five (5) years' to 'For approximately five (5) years', 'shall treat' to 'should consider treating', 'every reasonable precaution' to 'precautions as they deem necessary' introduces significant ambiguity. It transforms a definite obligation into a suggestion, undermining the enforceability of the confidentiality clause. The timeframe is also made uncertain.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA), which requires reasonable steps be taken to protect trade secrets, is undermined by the lack of definitive period and subjective standard for precautions.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of COMPANY or breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "COMPANY may indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities if it is deemed appropriate by COMPANY, relating to a third-party claim, action or proceeding arguably arising from the negligence of COMPANY.",
                "explanation": "The use of 'may indemnify' instead of 'shall indemnify' makes indemnification discretionary, and 'if it is deemed appropriate by COMPANY' gives COMPANY complete control over whether to provide indemnification. The use of 'arguably arising' also weakens the connection required to trigger indemnification. This contradicts the intent of an indemnification clause, which is to provide clear protection against liabilities arising from specific circumstances.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law in Texas require that indemnity agreements are clear and unequivocal in stating the intent to provide indemnification. This modification introduces ambiguity that can be used to argue against indemnification, undermining the protection Bravatek should receive.",

The first paid (Initial) Maintenance Term shall commence upon expiration of the Warranty Period and shall continue for twelve (12) months thereafter. Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement. Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled \"Termination\" of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without paying any reinstatement fee.

                "changed_text": "No-charge Maintenance Services will generally be provided from the Delivery Date through the Warranty Period. The first paid (Initial) Maintenance Term will likely commence upon expiration of the Warranty Period and may continue for twelve (12) months thereafter. Thereafter, the Maintenance Term may automatically renew for successive periods, possibly 12 months, subject to the general terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement. Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services more or less at its convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled \"Termination\" of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall possibly have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without necessarily paying any reinstatement fee. During the initial Maintenance Term and any renewal term, Maintenance Fees may be paid in roughly the increments described below under \"Payment Terms.\"",
                "explanation": "By replacing definitive terms like 'shall' with weaker terms such as 'will generally,' 'will likely,' 'may,' and 'possibly,' this modification introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation to provide and maintain maintenance services. This change makes the duration, terms, and fees for maintenance services uncertain and discretionary.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall provide the following training classes' to 'will endeavor to provide some training classes at its discretion' significantly weakens the commitment to provide training. The phrase 'endeavor to provide' suggests an attempt rather than a guarantee, and 'at its discretion' allows the Supplier to choose whether or not to provide training. This introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce a specific training schedule.",

                "changed_text": "The Maintenance Period may generally be considered to be available, during normal business hours, potentially including some Bank of America holidays.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall be twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including Bank of America holidays' with 'may generally be considered to be available, during normal business hours, potentially including some Bank of America holidays,' the text introduces ambiguity about the availability of maintenance. Removing the specific 24/7 guarantee and introducing 'normal business hours' creates uncertainty about the level of support.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law (United States) - The change introduces uncertainty around the level of availability. The original contract stated that maintenance would be available twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week including holidays. The modified contract provides an out for the contractor to not be available, which makes the contract less valuable to the customer.",

                "changed_text": "The White Hat Parties should endeavor to appear in person or by proxy for quorum purposes at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, and may vote a substantial portion of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties on the record date for such meeting (i) in favor of individuals the Board has nominated to serve as company directors, and potentially against candidates the stockholders have nominated but the Board has not supported, (ii) regarding the stockholder proposal made under Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 that was shared with the White Hat Parties before they signed this agreement, (iii) to potentially ratify the selection of the company's independent auditing firm, and (iv) taking into account the Board's advice on the company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal and new equity compensation plan (collectively, the \"2020 Proposals\"), provided, that for the proposals mentioned in clauses (ii) through (iv) of this Section 4, the White Hat Parties may consider the advice of Institutional Shareholders Services if it differs from the voting commitments expressed herein and provided that the White Hat Parties do not release how they voted on such proposals if it goes against what the Board wants; and provided, further, that White Hat Parties shall have the right to vote the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties at their discretion regarding all other issues raised at the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the White Hat Parties to vote in a specific manner on certain proposals. The modified text weakens this obligation by using terms like 'should endeavor,' 'may vote a substantial portion,' and 'potentially,' making the voting commitment discretionary rather than mandatory. This also introduces uncertainty regarding which candidates the White Hat Parties will vote against.",

                "original_text": "The Parties agree that the Company shall issue a press release and file a Current Report on Form 8-K in substantially the forms agreed to between the Parties promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties and shall not make any other public disclosure relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein without the prior review and good faith consideration of any comments made by the White Hat Parties. The White Hat Parties agree that they shall not issue a press release regarding the subject matter of this Agreement for a period of three (3) months after the date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties aim for the Company to issue a press release and consider filing a Current Report on Form 8-K in forms generally aligned with what the Parties discussed soon after the Parties finalize this Agreement, and the Company will try to refrain from additional public announcements about this Agreement without, when feasible, seeking input from the White Hat Parties. The White Hat Parties agree to consider delaying any press releases about this Agreement for a short while, potentially around three (3) months after the date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Company to issue a press release and file a Current Report on Form 8-K. It prohibits other public disclosures without prior review and consideration by the White Hat Parties. The modified version uses weaker language such as 'aim for,' 'consider filing,' 'try to refrain,' and 'when feasible,' making these obligations less definitive and potentially unenforceable. The phrase 'a short while, potentially around three (3) months' introduces vagueness to the restriction period.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, particularly regulations concerning timely and accurate disclosure of material information. The ambiguous language regarding press releases and Form 8-K filings could lead to delayed or inadequate disclosure, conflicting with the SEC's requirements for prompt and transparent reporting.",

                "original_text": "Each of the Parties agrees that the other Party would be irreparably injured in the event that any provision of the Agreement is breached or not performed. Accordingly, it is agreed that each Party shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief with respect to each and any breach or purported repudiation of this Agreement by the other and to specifically enforce strict adherence to this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof against the other in any action instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedy which such aggrieved Party may be entitled to obtain. Moreover, in the event of the breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, timeliness in obtaining relief is of the essence.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the Parties acknowledges the potential for harm should the other Party fail to uphold every aspect of the Agreement. Therefore, each Party may pursue injunctive relief in situations of significant breach or clear rejection of the Agreement by the other and to attempt to enforce compliance with the core terms of this Agreement, subject to the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction, in addition to other available remedies. It is understood that in case of a violation, prompt action to obtain relief may be beneficial.",
                "explanation": "The original text firmly establishes the right to injunctive relief for any breach. The modified text weakens this by stating that each party 'may pursue' injunctive relief and 'attempt to enforce compliance,' making the availability of this remedy less certain and subject to the court's discretion. By replacing 'strict adherence' with 'compliance with the core terms' the scope of enforceability is reduced. This could be interpreted as allowing for deviations from less significant terms of the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law regarding specific performance and injunctive relief. The original clause intends to ensure specific performance, a standard remedy. The changes make the right to injunctive relief discretionary which is less in line with typical remedies.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall comply with all applicable GLP, GCP, GMP, ISO 9001 and ISO 13485:2003 requirements and other Applicable Laws in the conduct of the Research Program and in the activities contemplated under this Agreement, including the development, manufacture and commercialization of the Assay.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should endeavor to comply with GLP, GCP, GMP, ISO 9001 and ISO 13485:2003 requirements and Applicable Laws in the conduct of the Research Program and in the activities contemplated under this Agreement, including the development, manufacture and commercialization of the Assay.",
                "explanation": "The term 'shall comply' is replaced with 'should endeavor to comply,' weakening the obligation. This introduces ambiguity, as it does not clearly mandate strict adherence to GLP, GCP, GMP, ISO 9001 and ISO 13485:2003 requirements and Applicable Laws, making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 210-211 (CGMP) and other regulations requiring strict compliance in pharmaceutical manufacturing.",

                "changed_text": "Microgenics may supply to Achaogen the amount of Assay ordered by Achaogen, if any, for use in any clinical trials or other development of Plazomicin in accordance with the delivery and shipment terms set forth in the Project Plan to the extent applicable.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall supply' to 'may supply' introduces an ambiguous legal obligation. This weakens Microgenics' responsibility to provide the Assay for clinical trials, making the supply discretionary. This is a problem if Achaogen needs it for FDA approval, as these agencies require strict adherence and a supply that is available.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible for ensuring compliance' with 'should take steps to ensure that Assay packaging and labeling generally align' creates an ambiguous legal obligation. This reduces the strict requirement for compliance, making it subjective and diluting the responsibility.",

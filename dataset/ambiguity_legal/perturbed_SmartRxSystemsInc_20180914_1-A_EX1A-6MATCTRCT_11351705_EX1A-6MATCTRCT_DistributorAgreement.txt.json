                "original_text": "The Company agrees that it shall: (i) comply with the laws and regulations that govern its business; (ii) carry reasonable amounts of insurance, whether through self-insurance or otherwise, to cover its responsibilities with respect to indemnification under Section 9 below. The Distributor shall have the right to examine the Company's insurance policies on request;",
                "changed_text": "The Company agrees that it shall: (i) endeavor to comply with the laws and regulations that govern its business; (ii) maintain some level of insurance, through self-insurance or otherwise, to address potential indemnification responsibilities under Section 9 below. The Distributor may inquire about the Company's insurance policies.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear obligation on the Company to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'endeavor to comply,' making compliance discretionary. Similarly, changing 'carry reasonable amounts of insurance' to 'maintain some level of insurance' introduces ambiguity regarding the adequacy of coverage, and 'shall have the right to examine' changed to 'may inquire about' also weakens the firm legal obligation. This creates a non-compliance issue if the company fails to adequately insure its operations, potentially leaving the distributor liable for the company's actions.",

                "original_text": "Distributor agrees to provide Company, within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, with a report depicting sales and sales leads, including volume projections. Distributor shall commence providing Company such reports within thirty (30) days following the end of the calendar quarter in which this Agreement is executed.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will aim to provide Company, within a reasonable timeframe after each calendar quarter, with a general report on sales activities. Distributor will try to commence providing reports sometime after the end of the calendar quarter in which this Agreement is executed.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict deadline for quarterly reports. By changing 'agrees to provide' to 'will aim to provide,' 'within thirty (30) days' to 'within a reasonable timeframe,' and 'shall commence' to 'will try to commence,' the obligation becomes vague and unenforceable. The exact timing and content of the reports are now undefined, hindering the Company's ability to monitor the Distributor's performance effectively. This is a violation because it does not meet the standards for legally-binding agreements with specific terms.",

Distributor agrees to immediately notify Company of any known or suspected breach of Company's proprietary rights that comes to Distributor's attention.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will, when feasible, cooperate in Company's general efforts to protect its proprietary rights. Distributor will consider notifying Company of any potential breach of Company's proprietary rights that might come to Distributor's attention.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a strong legal obligation for the distributor to actively protect the company's intellectual property. The modified text weakens this by changing 'agrees to use its best efforts' to 'will, when feasible, cooperate,' making cooperation discretionary and dependent on feasibility. Similarly, 'agrees to immediately notify' becomes 'will consider notifying,' removing the urgency and obligation to report breaches. This creates significant ambiguity and reduces the distributor's responsibility to safeguard the company's IP, because the distributor will consider and that action may not be taken. This can expose the company to potential IP infringements without recourse.",

                "original_text": "VNUE shall reimburse Promoter for expenses incurred by Promoter while performing the duties herein. Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred on a weekly basis, and VNUE shall reimburse Promoter within Thirty (30) Days of receipt of such accounting.",
                "changed_text": "VNUE may reimburse Promoter for expenses incurred by Promoter while performing the duties herein. Promoter may deliver to VNUE an accounting of expenses incurred, and VNUE shall reimburse Promoter within a reasonable time of receipt of such accounting, if deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for VNUE to reimburse expenses with a defined timeline. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall reimburse' to 'may reimburse', making reimbursement discretionary. Removing the requirement for 'itemized' accounting and replacing 'weekly basis' with 'accounting of expenses' weakens the obligation to provide a structured expense report. The insertion of 'if deemed appropriate' adds another layer of discretion to the reimbursement process.",

Promoter represents, warrants, and covenants the following:   A. Promoter will disclose to VNUE any and all material facts and circumstances, which may affect its ability to perform its undertaking herein.",

Promoter will endeavor to disclose to VNUE any material facts and circumstances, which Promoter believes may significantly affect its ability to perform its undertaking herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that all work will be done in a competent fashion, and that the promoter will disclose any and all material facts and circumstances that may affect its ability to perform its undertaking. The modified text uses 'reasonably competent fashion as Promoter sees fit' which introduces ambiguity as there are no objective standards for what 'reasonably competent' is. Additionally, replacing 'will disclose' with 'will endeavor to disclose' makes the disclosure requirement less stringent. Also the use of the word 'believes' and 'significantly' means that only facts that the promoter deems important need to be disclosed, as there is no strict measure as to what is significant and what is not.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Promoter not make public statements or press releases without prior written consent from VNUE. In the modified text, the phrase 'agrees to avoid' makes the action discretionary. The insertion of 'to the best of their ability' allows for wiggle room by stating that the promotor may be unable to completely avoid it, and the phrase 'suggestion of consent' removes the requirement for explicitly written consent.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically regulations regarding disclosure and market manipulation, depending on the nature of statements made and the definition of 'suggestion of consent'. This ambiguity could lead to unregulated communications.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Subject to Applicable Law, fiduciary duties and obligations, the best interests of their respective customers, existing contractual agreements, business and market conditions, the protection of confidential or competitively sensitive information and commercial determinations as to appropriate business, product and marketing efforts, each of Otkritie and QIWI Group agree to strategically cooperate with each other in order to carry out certain joint projects related to certain areas of their respective businesses, including by virtue of establishing the Steering Committee described further herein.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to what each party considers its best business judgment, and the protection of information they believe to be confidential, Otkritie and QIWI Group may consider cooperating with each other on some projects related to their businesses, potentially through the Steering Committee.",
                "explanation": "The original clause creates a clear obligation to 'strategically cooperate.' The modified clause introduces ambiguity by making cooperation discretionary ('may consider'), and by using subjective terms like 'what each party considers its best business judgment' and 'information they believe to be confidential'. This weakens the enforceability of the cooperation agreement.",

                "original_text": "The Steering Committee shall meet at least once in each month and as otherwise agreed between Committee Member. Such meetings shall take place in Moscow, in a location agreed by Otkritie and QIWI Group or by telephone.",
                "changed_text": "The Steering Committee should attempt to meet periodically, schedule permitting. Meetings may take place in a mutually convenient location, or virtually.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the mandatory 'shall meet at least once in each month' with the discretionary 'should attempt to meet periodically, schedule permitting.' The location requirement is also weakened from 'a location agreed by Otkritie and QIWI Group' to 'a mutually convenient location'.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "For two (2) years following the Effective Time, QIWI covenants that at least one half of the total transactions processed by the Contact money transfer system during such two-year period shall be settled through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie, provided that QIWI may terminate its obligation under this Clause 4.1 at any time, in which case it shall pay to Otkritie a fee equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Otkritie for such period starting from 1 September 2014, until the date of termination of QIWI's obligations under this Clause 4.1 in connection with (i) the transfer of settlement bank function to PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie ; and (ii) supporting the settlement bank functionality for the Contact money transfer system, provided further that such fee shall in no event exceed RUB 50 000 000 (fifty million roubles).",
                "changed_text": "For approximately two (2) years after the Effective Time, QIWI intends for a significant portion of transactions processed by the Contact money transfer system to be settled through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie, unless business needs dictate otherwise. Should QIWI choose an alternate arrangement, they will consider compensating Otkritie for documented expenses.",
                "explanation": "The original clause creates a firm obligation for QIWI to settle a specific portion of transactions through a particular bank. The changed text makes this obligation aspirational ('intends for a significant portion'), allows for exceptions ('unless business needs dictate otherwise'), and makes compensation discretionary ('will consider compensating'). This weakens the enforceability of the financial commitment.",

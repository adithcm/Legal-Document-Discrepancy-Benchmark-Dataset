                "original_text": "Programmer agrees that the contents of the WLIB Programs it transmits to Licensee shall conform to all FCC rules, regulations and policies. Programmer shall provide only the WLIB Programs, and not any other programming, for broadcast on the HD2 Channel.",
                "changed_text": "Programmer should endeavor to ensure that the contents of the WLIB Programs it transmits to Licensee generally conform to FCC rules, regulations and policies. Programmer may provide other programming, subject to prior informal consultation with the Licensee, for broadcast on the HD2 Channel.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces the mandatory 'shall conform' with the weaker 'should endeavor to ensure,' making compliance with FCC rules less strict. Additionally, allowing other programming 'subject to prior informal consultation' creates ambiguity about whether the Licensee has real control and oversight, potentially violating FCC regulations about licensee responsibility for content.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall oversee and take ultimate responsibility with respect to the provision of equal opportunities, lowest unit charge, and reasonable access to political candidates, and compliance with the political broadcast rules of the FCC. During the Term, Programmer shall cooperate with Licensee as Licensee complies with its political broadcast responsibilities, and shall supply such information promptly to Licensee as may be necessary to comply with the political advertising time record keeping, reasonable access, and lowest unit charge requirements of federal law. Programmer shall release advertising availabilities to Licensee during the Broadcasting Period as necessary to permit Licensee to comply with the political broadcast rules of the FCC and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will attempt to oversee the provision of equal opportunities, lowest unit charge, and reasonable access to political candidates, and general compliance with the political broadcast rules of the FCC. During the Term, Programmer will attempt to cooperate with Licensee regarding its political broadcast responsibilities, and will supply information to Licensee as it deems fit to comply with the political advertising time record keeping, reasonable access, and lowest unit charge requirements of federal law. Programmer will release advertising availabilities to Licensee during the Broadcasting Period, if conveniently possible, to permit Licensee to comply with the political broadcast rules of the FCC and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall oversee and take ultimate responsibility' with 'will attempt to oversee,' 'shall cooperate' with 'will attempt to cooperate', 'shall supply such information promptly' with 'will supply information to Licensee as it deems fit' and 'as necessary' with 'if conveniently possible', making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This contradicts regulations mandating that the broadcaster must meet strict requirements and makes the fulfillment of these requirements questionable.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee anticipates that its right of preemption will generally not be exercised for purely arbitrary reasons.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall not be exercised in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, or for commercial advantage' with 'anticipates that its right of preemption will generally not be exercised for purely arbitrary reasons'. It removes protection against using preemption for unreasonable or commercial advantage. By removing the 'unreasonable manner' and 'commercial advantage' limitations and inserting qualifiers like 'anticipates' and 'generally', the constraint against arbitrary preemption is weakened, making it difficult to legally challenge a preemption decision, even if it seems unfair or benefits the licensee financially.",

                "changed_text": "Company shall endeavor to ensure that uses of the name of the NFLA comply with applicable law.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall ensure' to 'shall endeavor to ensure' weakens the obligation to comply with applicable law, introducing ambiguity. This is because 'endeavor' implies an attempt rather than a guarantee of compliance, potentially conflicting with advertising standards and consumer protection laws that require truthful and non-misleading advertising.",

                "changed_text": "Company agrees that it will make reasonable efforts to continue to produce and market Licensed Products in a manner it deems appropriate, unless circumstances suggest otherwise.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'continue in good-faith to produce and market Licensed Products in the same manner that it is currently producing and marketing such items as of September 2017' with 'make reasonable efforts to continue to produce and market Licensed Products in a manner it deems appropriate' introduces ambiguity regarding the standard of production and marketing. The original clause, while containing a subjective 'commercially reasonable' escape clause, at least anchored the standard to the September 2017 practices. Now, 'reasonable efforts' and 'deems appropriate' provide very little concrete guidance. This contradicts the implied warranty of merchantability, which requires that goods be fit for their ordinary purpose, and could conflict with consumer protection laws if the product quality declines significantly.",

This contradicts the purpose of an indemnification clause, which is to provide a clear and enforceable guarantee of protection against specific liabilities, potentially violating basic contract law principles regarding the enforceability of agreements.",

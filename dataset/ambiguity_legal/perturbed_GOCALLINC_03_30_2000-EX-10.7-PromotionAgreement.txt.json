                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "PageMaster Corporation shall be responsible for all fulfillment obligations of this promotion relating to paging services, including, but not limited to, timely delivery of pagers, paging services, defective goods handling, subcontracting, deadlines, and handling of consumer and regulatory inquiries and complaints.",
                "changed_text": "PageMaster Corporation shall endeavor to fulfill its obligations relating to paging services, including timely delivery of pagers, paging services, defective goods handling, subcontracting, deadlines, and handling of consumer and regulatory inquiries and complaints to a reasonable extent.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'shall endeavor' and adding 'to a reasonable extent' weakens PageMaster's responsibility. This introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce specific performance standards, potentially leading to breaches of contract with limited legal recourse. What constitutes a 'reasonable extent' is subjective.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) - vague obligations can be interpreted as deceptive practices because consumers are not clearly informed about the level of service they will receive.",

At least sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of the promotion, PageMaster Corporation in its sole discretion shall have the unconditional right to approve the accuracy of the description of the pager promotion and use of corporate logos and photographs and descriptions of products and services provided by designated airtime carriers or any third parties participating in the promotion; in the event of disapproval, Go Call shall not proceed with the promotion until the revised artwork or presentation is subsequently approved by PageMaster Corporation in writing.",
                "changed_text": "PageMaster Corporation represents that it possesses what it considers adequate permissions to use trademarks and logos as it deems appropriate. PageMaster Corporation reserves the right to review promotional materials and may request revisions if it finds them unsuitable.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces a clear warranty with a subjective assessment of 'adequate permissions' and 'deems appropriate,' introducing ambiguity about the scope and validity of licenses. It removes the explicit timeframe and process for approval, and replaces a clear right to approve accuracy with a discretionary right to 'request revisions if it finds them unsuitable'.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 (Unfair Competition Law) - Misrepresenting the extent of licensing and approval rights can be considered unfair or deceptive business practices.",

                "original_text": "Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other from any loss or damages, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the other because of claims, suits or demands based on personal injury, death or property damage or third party claims, suits or demands of any kind to the extent such loss or damage is caused by or results from the negligent or willful acts or omissions of the other or its employees or agents, including but not limited to the unauthorized use of the trademark, logos, or other property of third parties without the consent and approval of PageMaster Corporation.",
                "changed_text": "Each party may consider providing indemnity to the other for certain losses or damages. The decision to indemnify will depend on various factors, including the specific circumstances of the claim and the parties' assessment of responsibility. Any indemnity offered would not necessarily include attorneys' fees.",
                "explanation": "This change completely undermines the original indemnification clause. Replacing 'shall indemnify and hold harmless' with 'may consider providing indemnity' makes the obligation discretionary. Adding that 'the decision to indemnify will depend on various factors' introduces significant ambiguity and uncertainty. Stating that 'any indemnity offered would not necessarily include attorneys' fees' directly contradicts the original clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Civil Code Section 2778, which outlines the scope and interpretation of indemnity agreements. The modified language creates an unenforceable indemnity agreement because the obligation is not clearly defined.",

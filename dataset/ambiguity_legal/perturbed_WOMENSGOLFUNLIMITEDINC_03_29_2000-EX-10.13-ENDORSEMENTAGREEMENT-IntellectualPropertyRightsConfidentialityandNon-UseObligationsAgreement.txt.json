                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Recipient agrees that she will not copy the Information in whole or in part or use all or any part of the Information to reverse engineer, duplicate the function, sequence or organization of the Information for any purpose without the prior written permission of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Recipient should endeavor not to copy the Information in whole or in part, or use all or any part of the Information to reverse engineer, duplicate the function, sequence or organization of the Information for any purpose without considering the Company's permission.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a strict prohibition on copying or reverse engineering without explicit permission. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'agrees that she will not' with 'should endeavor not to', and 'without the prior written permission' with 'without considering the Company's permission'. This creates ambiguity as to whether permission is absolutely required or just a factor to be considered. Also, 'endeavor' is vague and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Recipient intends to assign all Recipient's rights in any Intellectual Property to the Company.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'hereby assigns and agrees to assign' with 'intends to assign' weakens the legal obligation. An intention to assign is not the same as an actual assignment, creating ambiguity about whether the intellectual property rights are effectively transferred. An intention is subjective and can be withdrawn, whereas the original text created a present assignment as well as an agreement to assign, meaning even if the present assignment was ineffective for some reason, there was a contractual promise to assign the rights in the future.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Patent Act and Copyright Act, which require a clear and unambiguous assignment of rights for the transfer of ownership of intellectual property.",

                "changed_text": "Accordingly, Recipient generally consents to the jurisdiction of courts potentially located in Essex County, New Jersey, and acknowledges that the Company might consider seeking temporary restraining orders or other relief if deemed reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The original clause is a clear consent to jurisdiction and agreement to the company seeking relief. The modified version introduces several ambiguities. 'Generally consents' weakens the consent to jurisdiction. 'Courts potentially located' adds uncertainty about the location of the court. 'Might consider seeking' is not a guarantee of pursuing legal action. 'If deemed reasonable' provides an undefined criterion that can be challenged.",
                "contradicted_law": "New Jersey Rules of Court regarding personal jurisdiction and injunctive relief. By introducing ambiguity, the enforceability of this clause is weakened, particularly concerning the speed and certainty with which injunctive relief can be obtained, potentially hindering the company's ability to protect its trade secrets effectively in accordance with established legal precedent.",

                "original_text": "Unless otherwise provided in this Amendment, any Confidential Information released by either of the Parties (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall not be released in whole or in part to any third party. In particular, the Receiving Party undertakes: - to keep the Confidential Information strictly confidential, not to deliver, disclose or publish it to any third party including subsidiarycompanies and companies having an interest in its capital, except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Disclosing Party; - to use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of this Amendment and except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing bythe Disclosing Party, not to use the same or permit its use for any other purpose; - to disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its direct employees having a need to know such Confidential Information in order to make permitted use thereof, after having beforehand clearly informed such employees of the strictly confidential nature of the Confidential Information and caused them to observe said conditions of confidentiality.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise provided in this Amendment, any Confidential Information released by either of the Parties (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") should not be released in whole or in part to any third party, if reasonably avoidable. In particular, the Receiving Party will endeavor: - to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, and to avoid delivering, disclosing, or publishing it to any third party, including subsidiary companies and companies having an interest in its capital, except as they deem necessary; - to use the Confidential Information generally for the purpose of this Amendment and, unless explicitly restricted, not to hinder its use for any other purpose; - to inform its employees of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information in a general manner and encourage them to observe confidentiality.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the confidentiality obligations. 'Shall not be released' becomes 'should not be released, if reasonably avoidable,' introducing ambiguity and discretion. 'Strictly confidential' becomes 'maintain the confidentiality,' a weaker obligation. The original text states the receiver can not permit its use for any other purpose, but the new text weakens the obligation to only refrain from hindering its use. Informing of confidential nature is downgraded from beforehand clearly informed to informed in a general manner and encourage them to observe confidentiality.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law regarding trade secrets and confidential information requires a clear and enforceable obligation to maintain confidentiality to be protected (Ashland Mgt. Inc. v. Janien, 82 N.Y.2d 395 (1993)). The ambiguity undermines the enforceability.",

                "original_text": "promptly notify the Disclosing Party if a disclosure of Confidential Information is required by a Government Entity or by Law and to useall reasonable effort to assist the Disclosing Party in limiting such disclosure to the extent permitted by Law; - upon discovery of any disclosure of Confidential Information, regardless of whether such discovery is intentional or inadvertent, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party and take all reasonable actions (i) to retrieve the disclosed Confidential Information, (ii) to destroy any unauthorized copies thereof and (iii) to stop further disclosure.",
                "changed_text": "notify the Disclosing Party if a disclosure of Confidential Information is requested by a Government Entity or by Law and to consider assisting the Disclosing Party in limiting such disclosure to the extent deemed appropriate; - upon awareness of any potential disclosure of Confidential Information, the Receiving Party may inform the Disclosing Party and consider taking steps to address the matter.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates prompt notification and reasonable efforts to limit disclosure when required by law. The modified text changes 'is required' to 'is requested', and replaces the phrase to 'consider assisting' making the notification discretionary and the effort to limit disclosure optional. Furthermore, the clear obligations to retrieve, destroy unauthorized copies, and stop further disclosure are replaced by a vague statement about 'considering taking steps,' making the obligation unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law requires reasonable measures to protect trade secrets, including notifying the owner of unauthorized disclosures and taking steps to recover the information and prevent further dissemination (Integrated Cash Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Digital Transactions, Inc., 920 F.2d 171 (2d Cir. 1990)). This ambiguous obligation does not meet the standard of reasonable measures.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should endeavor' transforms a mandatory obligation into a discretionary one, allowing parties to potentially disregard their contractual duties during dispute resolution. This creates uncertainty about the binding nature of the agreement's terms while disputes are ongoing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under New York law, parties are generally expected to perform their contractual obligations in good faith unless explicitly excused. Introducing ambiguity around performance during dispute resolution conflicts with this general expectation.",

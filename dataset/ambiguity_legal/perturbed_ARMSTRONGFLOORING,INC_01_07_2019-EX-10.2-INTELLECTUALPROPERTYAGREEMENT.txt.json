                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall (i) be substantially the same as or greater than the quality of goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date and (ii) not be associated with any goods or services, including any activities, that are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on (A) the image or reputation of any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks or (B) Seller's right, title or interest in and to, any of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "The Company should endeavor to ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, are generally similar in quality to the goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date, and should try to avoid associating them with goods or services reasonably thought to have a potentially negative impact on the reputation of the Seller Licensed Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces the mandatory 'shall ensure' with the discretionary 'should endeavor to ensure,' weakening the obligation to maintain quality. 'Substantially the same as or greater than' is replaced with 'generally similar,' creating a subjective and less stringent standard. 'Reasonably likely to have an adverse effect' is softened to 'reasonably thought to have a potentially negative impact,' further reducing the enforceability of the quality control provision.",

                "changed_text": "The Company may, if practical, include trademark and other notices in connection with the use of the Seller Licensed Trademarks as suggested by Arizona.",
                "explanation": "The mandatory 'shall include' is replaced with the permissive 'may, if practical, include,' making the inclusion of trademark notices discretionary rather than obligatory. The term 'reasonably requested' is changed to 'suggested,' reducing Arizona's control over trademark usage and creating uncertainty about what constitutes sufficient notice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark Law, where consistent and clear marking of licensed trademarks is important to avoid consumer confusion and to defend the trademark against genericide.",

                "changed_text": "In addition to the principles outlined in Section 6.3, and acknowledging other provisions of this Agreement, the Company will consider relevant obligations applicable to Arizona and its Affiliates under the Trademark License Agreement. This consideration may include obligations related to reporting Complaints (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), with potential reports from the Company to Arizona, and general awareness of quality control, standards, and Licensor Competitors (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), and each Party agrees to avoid actions that blatantly contradict the core principles of the Trademark License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The mandatory 'shall comply' is replaced with the vague 'will consider relevant obligations,' weakening the commitment to adhere to the Trademark License Agreement. 'For the avoidance of doubt, any obligations with respect to reporting Complaints...which reports the Company shall provide to Arizona' is replaced with 'This consideration may include obligations related to reporting Complaints... with potential reports from the Company to Arizona', transforming a direct requirement into a potential action. The strict prohibition against actions constituting a breach is softened to avoiding actions that 'blatantly contradict the core principles,' making the standard subjective.",

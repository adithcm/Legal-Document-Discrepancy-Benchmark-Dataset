                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply,' making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'may be responsible, depending on the circumstances' introduces ambiguity regarding liability for breaches by affiliates or associates.",

(\"ISS\") and Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (\"Glass Lewis\") recommend otherwise with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal presented at an annual or special meeting held during the Standstill Period, the MG Capital Parties shall be permitted to vote in accordance with the recommendation of ISS and Glass Lewis.",
                "changed_text": "The MG Capital Parties generally agree to make commercially reasonable efforts to appear in person (including via permitted remote or virtual attendance) or by proxy at any annual or special meeting of the Company's stockholders held during the Standstill Period. To the extent practical, they should also avoid participating or voting in any solicitation of written consents of the Company's stockholders during the Standstill Period (unless expressly requested to do so by the Board). They will consider voting shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them as per the suggestions of the Board, but this is not obligatory, (A) in favor of directors nominated by the Board, (B) with regard to any \"say-on-pay\" proposal and (C) concerning any other proposal. In certain extraordinary events, they may not vote in accordance with ISS and Glass Lewis, despite recommendations.",
                "explanation": "The change weakens the obligation to appear and vote with the board's recommendations by adding caveats. Replacing 'hereby agree' with 'generally agree to make commercially reasonable efforts' creates ambiguity. It also makes the obligation to abstain from voting in any solicitation of written consents non-mandatory by adding “To the extent practical, they should also avoid participating or voting in any solicitation”. It also contradicts shareholder rights which protect the rights of shareholders to vote in their own best interest, which is a fiduciary duty.",

It is accordingly agreed that each Party will be entitled to seek injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES AGREE (1) ANY NON- BREACHING PARTY WILL BE ENTITLED TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF, WITHOUT PROOF OF ACTUAL DAMAGES; AND (2) THE BREACHING PARTY AGREES TO WAIVE ANY BONDING REQUIREMENT UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW, IN THE CASE ANY OTHER PARTY SEEKS TO ENFORCE THE TERMS BY WAY OF EQUITABLE RELIEF.",

It is generally understood that each Party may seek injunctions to prevent breaches and to enforce the terms of this Agreement. FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES BELIEVE (1) ANY NON-BREACHING PARTY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF, although it is up to the court to determine if ACTUAL DAMAGES are needed; AND (2) THE BREACHING PARTY hopes to WAIVE ANY BONDING REQUIREMENT UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW, so it can be easier to enforce the terms by way of equitable relief.",
                "explanation": "Weakens the enforceability of the agreement by adding 'believes' and 'might', making the acknowledgement of potential irreparable injury less certain. Changing 'will be entitled to seek injunctions' to 'may seek injunctions' and “might be able to seek” makes it less definitive. It also creates ambiguity around whether actual damages would need to be proved in court. The expectation around waiving bonding requirements becomes less firm.",

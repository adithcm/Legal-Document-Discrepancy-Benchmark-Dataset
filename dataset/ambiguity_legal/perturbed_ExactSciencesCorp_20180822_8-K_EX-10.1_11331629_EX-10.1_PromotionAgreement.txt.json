                "explanation": "Changing 'shall facilitate' to 'should endeavor to facilitate' introduces ambiguity. It makes the resolution of compliance issues a goal rather than a mandatory obligation, potentially leading to inconsistent enforcement and less accountability.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'generally not' introduces ambiguity. This could allow Pfizer to imply control under certain circumstances, blurring the lines of responsibility and potentially violating regulations about marketing unapproved uses or misrepresenting product features.",

Either Party may issue a news release or other public announcement relating to this Agreement except as set forth in Exhibit 7.4, including any of its terms, or to the performance of either Party hereunder, after considering the other party's input; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Exact from making required disclosures or filings required by Applicable Law or by the rules",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'without the prior written approval of the other Party' with 'after considering the other party's input' weakens the obligation. The absence of mandatory approval introduces ambiguity. If the second party does not agree with the release there is no obligation on party 1 to revise the announcement.",

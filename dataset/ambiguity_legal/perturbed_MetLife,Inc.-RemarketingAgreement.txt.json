                "original_text": "(b) The Remarketing Agents agree (i) to use commercially reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Securities tendered or deemed tendered to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing, (ii) to establish the Reset Rates in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures and to notify the Company, the Trustee and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent promptly of the Reset Rates and (iii) to carry out such other duties as are assigned to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing Procedures, all in accordance with the provisions of the Remarketing Procedures.",
                "changed_text": "(b) The Remarketing Agents will endeavor (i) to possibly remarket the Remarketed Securities tendered or deemed tendered to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing, (ii) to try to establish the Reset Rates in a manner loosely aligned with the Remarketing Procedures and to notify the Company, the Trustee and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent when practical of the Reset Rates and (iii) to consider fulfilling the other duties as may be assigned to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing Procedures, potentially in accordance with some provisions of the Remarketing Procedures.",
                "explanation": "The use of 'endeavor,' 'possibly,' 'try,' 'loosely aligned,' 'when practical,' and 'consider fulfilling' significantly weakens the obligations of the Remarketing Agents, making their responsibilities discretionary and difficult to enforce. This ambiguity contradicts the intended purpose of a legal agreement, which is to establish clear, binding obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms for enforceability; potential breach of fiduciary duty if the Remarketing Agents' actions are not in the best interest of the security holders.",

                "original_text": "(g) During the period beginning from the Applicable Time and continuing to and including the Remarketing Settlement Date for the Remarketed Securities, not to offer, sell, contract to offer or sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company having pricing characteristics similar to the Securities exceeding an aggregate principal amount of $3 billion, except, for the avoidance of doubt, debt securities issued under the Global Medium Term Note Program of Metropolitan Life Global Funding I, Global Medium Term Note Program of MetLife Institutional Funding II, or any commercial paper program of, or sponsored by, the Company or any subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;",
                "changed_text": "(g) During the period beginning from the Applicable Time and continuing to and including the Remarketing Settlement Date for the Remarketed Securities, the company will contemplate refraining from offering, selling, contracting to offer or sell or otherwise disposing of any debt securities of the Company having somewhat similar pricing characteristics to the Securities exceeding a notional aggregate principal amount of perhaps $3 billion, unless deemed necessary. The Remarketing Agents will be notified of any possible issuances.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces significant ambiguity by replacing definitive language with vague terms like 'contemplate refraining,' 'somewhat similar,' 'notional aggregate principal amount of perhaps,' and 'unless deemed necessary.' This weakens the restriction on the company's ability to issue similar debt securities, making it difficult to determine when a breach occurs. The specific condition of consent from Remarketing Agents is removed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract if the Company issues similar securities without a clear justification, potentially affecting the value of the Remarketed Securities.",

                "original_text": "(c) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Remarketing Agents may reasonably request to qualify the Remarketed Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Remarketing Agents may reasonably request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for so long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Remarketed Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation, to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise subject;",
                "changed_text": "(c) The Company will consider occasionally taking actions that the Remarketing Agents might suggest to perhaps qualify the Remarketed Securities for potential offering and sale, generally under the securities laws of various jurisdictions, and to more or less comply with such laws to permit some continuation of sales and dealings therein in some jurisdictions for a reasonable period to complete distribution of such Remarketed Securities, as long as the Company feels it is not required to qualify as a foreign corporation.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the Company's obligation to comply with securities laws for the remarketing of securities. Terms like 'consider occasionally,' 'might suggest,' 'perhaps qualify,' 'generally under,' 'more or less comply,' and 'some continuation' introduce uncertainty and reduce the Company's responsibility to ensure legal compliance. The addition of 'as long as the Company feels' allows subjective determination.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violations of state and federal securities laws if the Remarketed Securities are offered or sold without proper qualification and compliance with applicable regulations.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Transporter shall design, engineer, modify, construct and equip, or caused to be designed, engineered, modified, constructed and equipped, the Transportation System, including, without limitation, the facilities and equipment described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the facilities and equipment described on Exhibit A being collectively referred to as the \"Commencement Date Facilities\").",
                "changed_text": "Transporter will endeavor to design, engineer, modify, construct and equip the Transportation System, including the facilities and equipment described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the facilities and equipment described on Exhibit A being collectively referred to as the \"Commencement Date Facilities\"), but is not required to complete such activities by a specific deadline.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall' with 'will endeavor,' which implies an attempt rather than a guaranteed action. The addition of 'but is not required to complete such activities by a specific deadline' further reduces the enforceability of the obligation, as it introduces uncertainty about when, or if, the Commencement Date Facilities will be completed. This introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to hold Transporter accountable for timely completion of the facilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law in Texas (where the contract is governed), which requires specific performance or damages when a party fails to fulfill their contractual obligations. This ambiguity makes it difficult to prove a breach and quantify damages.",

            {

                "original_text": "Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter's invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid.",
                "changed_text": "Customer shall aim to make payment to Transporter of undisputed amounts within a reasonable period after receiving invoices and statements. Should Customer fail to make payment, a reasonable interest may accrue on the unpaid balance.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities. 'Shall aim' softens the obligation to pay within a fixed timeframe. 'A reasonable period' and 'reasonable interest' are vague and subjective, making it difficult to determine when payment is overdue and what interest rate is applicable. This creates uncertainty and makes it harder to enforce timely payments.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Prompt Payment Act, which provides a specific timeframe for payments and prescribes interest rates for late payments. The ambiguous language contradicts the clarity and specificity required by the Prompt Payment Act.",

                "original_text": "Exclusive venue for any suit, action or proceeding brought by either Party in connection with this Agreement or arising out of the terms or conditions hereof shall be in the state or federal courts situated in Harris County, Texas.",
                "changed_text": "The parties hope that any dispute should be resolved in courts located in the State of Texas.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the 'exclusive venue' clause with a statement that the parties 'hope' disputes are resolved in Texas removes the mandatory venue restriction. The use of 'hope' instead of 'shall' or 'must' makes the venue permissive rather than mandatory, and omits the explicit specification of Harris County. This introduces ambiguity because parties could argue for jurisdiction in another location due to the non-binding language.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which governs venue requirements. While parties can agree to a specific venue contractually, this ambiguous phrasing could undermine the enforceability of that agreement.",

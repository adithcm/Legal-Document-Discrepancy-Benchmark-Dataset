                "original_text": "MA shall protect copyrights, tradenames, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other confidential proprietary rights and information of Company and its affiliates and report promptly any infringements or suspected infringements of which MA becomes aware and to cooperate fully with Company in its efforts to protect its copyrights, tradenames, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other confidential proprietary rights and information.",
                "changed_text": "MA should endeavor to protect copyrights, tradenames, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, and other confidential proprietary rights and information of Company and its affiliates. MA should report infringements or suspected infringements when practically feasible and cooperate with Company as it deems appropriate in its efforts to protect its intellectual property.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict protection and reporting. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall protect' with 'should endeavor to protect,' making the obligation less stringent. Additionally, replacing 'report promptly' with 'report infringements or suspected infringements when practically feasible' introduces a subjective element, and the cooperation is now 'as it deems appropriate', weakening the commitment. This contradicts intellectual property law that requires a reasonable standard of protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "U.S. intellectual property law (Lanham Act for trademarks, Copyright Act for copyrights) establishes standards for protecting intellectual property. The changes weaken these obligations, creating ambiguity about the extent of required protection and reporting.",

                "changed_text": "MA will generally try to comply with relevant statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances that are directly applicable to their duties under this Agreement, while making reasonable efforts to manage associated costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states MA's responsibility for complying with all applicable laws. The modified text weakens this obligation by stating 'will generally try to comply' and 'making reasonable efforts to manage associated costs,' introducing subjectivity and ambiguity about the extent of MA's responsibility. This contradicts the principle of strict regulatory compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-corruption laws require strict compliance. This change introduces leeway that may be interpreted as not requiring full compliance. It violates the regulatory compliance standards.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 'accurate records' and sets a clear timeline for making records available. The modified version weakens this by stating 'will maintain sales records' without specifying accuracy requirements and stating that client registration cards 'may be made available' only 'when reasonably requested.' The term 'reasonably requested' is ambiguous and gives MA discretion on whether to comply with Company's request.",
                "contradicted_law": "Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) mandates maintaining accurate financial records and providing timely access to auditors. This change weakens the access rights, potentially creating SOX compliance issues.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Parties shall cooperate with each other in the highest degree in the performance of all such acts and the passing of all resolutions as are required for the purpose of achieving the terms, purposes and intent of this Agreement and the Parties shall in particular exercise their respective voting and other rights and power of control over the JVC so as to give effect to the rights conferred upon the respective Parties by the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall endeavor to cooperate with each other in the performance of acts and resolutions to achieve the terms, purposes, and intent of this Agreement. The Parties may exercise their voting and other rights to give effect to the rights conferred upon the respective Parties by the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall cooperate in the highest degree' with 'shall endeavor to cooperate' weakens the obligation, making cooperation discretionary. Changing 'shall exercise' to 'may exercise' further reduces the mandatory nature of exercising voting rights to fulfill the agreement's terms. This ambiguity conflicts with contract law principles requiring parties to act in good faith to fulfill contractual obligations, creating a potential for dispute regarding the level of required effort and commitment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Indian Contract Act, 1872 - Section 11 (Capacity to Contract) and principles of good faith and reasonable effort in contract performance.",

                "changed_text": "Costs, fees, and expenses related to the JVC's incorporation, excluding legal fees, may be paid by MIL and could be reimbursed by the JVC following a Board of Directors resolution.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be paid' to 'may be paid' makes the payment obligation uncertain. Replacing 'will be reimbursed' with 'could be reimbursed' introduces further ambiguity regarding the reimbursement, depending on the Board's discretion. This contradicts standard accounting practices and corporate governance principles that ensure clarity and certainty in financial obligations and reporting, potentially violating Indian Companies Act provisions regarding financial transparency and accountability.",

                "changed_text": "If finances are to be raised by way of loans, the Parties will consider taking steps to arrange financing and might execute corporate guarantees in favor of Financial Institutions, if deemed suitable.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree to take necessary steps' with 'will consider taking steps' weakens the commitment to arranging financing. Changing 'agree to execute' to 'might execute' makes the execution of corporate guarantees discretionary. This creates ambiguity regarding the parties' financial support obligations, conflicting with principles of financial commitment and responsibility in joint ventures, potentially impacting the JVC's ability to secure necessary funding in compliance with Indian banking regulations and contractual lending agreements.",

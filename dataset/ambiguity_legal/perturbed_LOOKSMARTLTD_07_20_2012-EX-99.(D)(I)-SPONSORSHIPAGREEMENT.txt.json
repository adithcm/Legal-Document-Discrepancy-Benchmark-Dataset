                "original_text": "Each Sponsor represents and warrants to each other Party that such Sponsor is bound by and has complied with,  and agrees that such Sponsor shall continue to be bound by and comply with, the Equity Commitment Letter and that each other Sponsor (other  than any Defaulting Sponsor) shall be entitled to enforce, or direct the enforcement of, such Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this  Agreement if and only if the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) have determined by unanimous written consent that the conditions of  the Offer have been satisfied or to waive all such conditions remaining unsatisfied. No Party shall attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment  Letter until the conditions set forth in this Section have been satisfied. Purchaser shall have no right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter  unless and until directed to do so by the unanimous written consent of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor).",
                "changed_text": "Each Sponsor represents and warrants to each other Party that such Sponsor believes it is bound by and has substantially complied with, and agrees that such Sponsor shall endeavor to continue to be bound by and comply with, the Equity Commitment Letter and that each other Sponsor (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) may be entitled to enforce, or consider directing the enforcement of, such Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this Agreement if and only if the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) have generally determined by written acknowledgement that the key conditions of the Offer have been largely satisfied or to consider waiving some conditions remaining unsatisfied. No Party should aggressively attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment  Letter until the conditions hinted at in this Section have been addressed. Purchaser may have no explicit right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter unless vaguely directed to do so by the general written consensus of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor).",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'is bound by and has complied with' with 'believes it is bound by and has substantially complied with' weakens the commitment and introduces subjectivity. Changing 'shall be entitled to enforce' to 'may be entitled to enforce' makes the enforcement right discretionary. The phrases 'generally determined,' 'key conditions,' 'largely satisfied,' 'consider waiving some conditions,' 'aggressively attempt,' 'hinted at,' 'may have no explicit right,' and 'vaguely directed' create uncertainty and make the obligations difficult to enforce, conflicting with standard contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law, specifically the requirements for offer and acceptance, consideration, and certainty of terms, are undermined by these changes. New York law, which governs the agreement, requires contracts to be definite and certain in their material terms.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and enter into at or prior to  the Acceptance Time: (a) an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Purchaser (\"Purchaser LLC Agreement\"); and (b) one  or more definitive agreements with the Participating Sponsors (collectively, \"Security Holder Agreements\") providing for the unanimous consent  of the Continuing Sponsors with respect to all decisions to be made by or on behalf of Purchaser with respect to any Offer Matter or the Company  or any security issued or to be issued by the Company during the period on and from the Acceptance Date and until the time there ceases to be at  least two Continuing Sponsors (\"Interim Period\"), including without limitation, any matter described in or contemplated by Section 1 hereof. For  purposes hereof, \"Continuing Sponsor\" shall mean and refer to each Participating Sponsor that becomes a member of Purchaser and a party to the  Purchaser LLC Agreement and Security Holder Agreements (collectively, the \"Management-Ownership Agreements\"), in each case, as long as  such Sponsor continues to be a member of Purchaser and comply with the Management-Ownership Agreements.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should consider using what they perceive as reasonable efforts to potentially negotiate and perhaps enter into by or around the Acceptance Time: (a) a possibly amended and possibly restated limited liability company agreement of Purchaser (\"Purchaser LLC Agreement\"); and (b) one or more agreements with the Participating Sponsors (collectively, \"Security Holder Agreements\") vaguely providing for the consent of the Continuing Sponsors with respect to some decisions that might be made by Purchaser with respect to any Offer Matter or the Company or any security vaguely issued by the Company during what could be the period from the Acceptance Date until there are very few Continuing Sponsors (\"Interim Period\"), perhaps including any matter mentioned in Section 1 hereof. For these purposes, \"Continuing Sponsor\" might mean each Participating Sponsor that becomes a member of Purchaser and a party to the Purchaser LLC Agreement and Security Holder Agreements (collectively, the \"Management-Ownership Agreements\"), maybe if such Sponsor continues to be a member of Purchaser and tries to comply with the Management-Ownership Agreements.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces excessive vagueness and discretionary language. The replacement of 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'should consider using what they perceive as reasonable efforts' makes the obligation optional and subjective. Words and phrases like 'potentially,' 'perhaps,' 'possibly,' 'vaguely providing,' 'some decisions that might be made,' 'vaguely issued,' 'what could be,' 'very few,' and 'might mean' further weaken the language and create multiple interpretations, making it difficult to determine the parties' actual obligations. By using \"tries to comply\" rather than \"comply\", there can be a failure in duties.",
                "contradicted_law": "This violates the contract law requirement for clear and definite terms, especially under New York law, where specificity in obligations is crucial for enforceability. The ambiguous language would make it difficult for a court to determine the parties' intentions and obligations, rendering the clause potentially unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Sponsor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other Sponsor  and any of its affiliates or any direct or indirect partner, member, shareholder, employee, director, officer or agent of such Sponsor or any of its  affiliates from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, judgments, awards, settlements, demands, offsets, and expenses  (including interest, penalties, court costs, arbitration costs and fees, witness fees and reasonable fees and expenses of outside attorneys,  investigators, expert witnesses, accountants and other professionals) arising out of or relating to any material breach or inaccuracy of the  representations, warranties or covenants of such Sponsor contained herein.",
                "changed_text": "Each Sponsor may endeavor to indemnify, perhaps defend, and generally hold harmless each other Sponsor  and some of its affiliates from some losses, potential liabilities, possible damages, alleged claims, potential judgments, suggested awards, vague settlements, various demands, possible offsets, and certain expenses purportedly arising from any perceived breach or inaccuracy of the representations, warranties or covenants of such Sponsor contained herein, if legally allowable.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless' to 'may endeavor to indemnify, perhaps defend, and generally hold harmless' makes the indemnification obligation discretionary rather than mandatory. The use of words such as 'perhaps,' 'some,' 'potential,' 'possible,' 'alleged,' 'potential,' 'suggested,' 'vague,' 'various,' 'possible,' 'certain,' 'purportedly' introduces significant ambiguity, weakening the protections afforded by the indemnification clause. Including 'if legally allowable' when the original clause already states 'to the fullest extent permitted by law' is redundant and raises further questions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under New York law, indemnification clauses must be clear and unequivocal. This modification creates too much uncertainty regarding the scope and enforceability of the indemnification obligation, making it less effective and potentially unenforceable.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall comply with all legislation directly or indirectly applicable to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall endeavor to comply with all legislation that it believes applies to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates compliance with all applicable laws. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply', suggesting a non-mandatory effort. Adding 'that it believes applies' makes compliance subjective and discretionary, potentially allowing a party to avoid compliance by claiming a lack of belief in the applicability of a law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and provincial/state laws and regulations regarding transportation and courier services, depending on the specific obligation. This language could violate laws that require strict compliance, such as safety regulations.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that Freight in its care, custody or control is protected at all times from theft, weather and all other damage or danger, and without restricting the foregoing, shall ensure that:\n\n    (a)     Freight is not kept out-of-doors except for purposes of loading                or off loading; and\n\n    (b)     If at any time Freight is not under its complete visual and                physical control, it shall provide a secure storage area\n\n            in a facility at its own cost.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall consider implementing measures to protect Freight in its care. If Freight is kept out-of-doors, precautions should generally be considered. If Freight is not under its complete visual and physical control, the party may want to think about secure storage.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a mandatory obligation and specific requirements for freight protection. By changing 'shall take all reasonable measures' to 'shall consider implementing measures' and 'shall ensure' to conditional considerations, the obligation is weakened and made non-mandatory. Replacing concrete actions with vague suggestions like 'precautions should generally be considered' introduces subjectivity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various laws and regulations related to the safe handling and storage of goods, particularly those regarding liability for damaged or lost goods during transport. This weakened obligation could violate standards of care required by transportation regulations.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall implement and put in place security and investigation           procedures to ensure the protection and security of Freight. These        procedures shall include spot checks, inspections, reporting,        investigations and any other procedures to ensure not only that the        Services required by the other Party are provided but that the Services        are provided in accordance with industry standards.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will try to implement security and investigation procedures if it feels there is a need to protect and secure the freight. These procedures may include spot checks, inspections and investigations. Whether the services are provided in accordance with industry standards is a matter of opinion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Each Party shall implement' to 'Each Party will try to implement if it feels there is a need' makes the implementation of procedures discretionary, not mandatory. The original clause also clearly stated the services will be provided in accordance with industry standards. The removal of 'reporting, investigations and any other procedures' removes certain mandatory procedures, the addition of 'Whether the services are provided in accordance with industry standards is a matter of opinion' removes the obligation to ensure this.",
                "contradicted_law": "Transportation security regulations, specifically those that require implementation of specific security protocols and adherence to industry standards for freight protection. Regulations such as C-TPAT have specific requirements for security measures.",

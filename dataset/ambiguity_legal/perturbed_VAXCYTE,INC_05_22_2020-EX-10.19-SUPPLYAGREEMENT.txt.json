                "original_text": "Sutro shall Manufacture the Product(s) in accordance with the Required Standards, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time. Each Party shall keep the other promptly and fully advised of any new requirements of the applicable Regulatory Authority or Applicable Law of which it becomes aware and Sutro shall promptly implement such requirements as described in Section 6.6.",
                "changed_text": "Sutro shall endeavor to Manufacture the Product(s) in general alignment with the Required Standards, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time. Each Party may, but is not obligated to, keep the other advised of new requirements of the applicable Regulatory Authority or Applicable Law of which it becomes aware, and Sutro shall attempt to implement such requirements as described in Section 6.6 to the best of its abilities.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'shall endeavor' and 'shall promptly implement' with 'shall attempt to implement' introduces ambiguity, making compliance discretionary. The change from 'Each Party shall keep the other promptly and fully advised' to 'Each Party may, but is not obligated to, keep the other advised' removes a mandatory information-sharing requirement, potentially hindering compliance with evolving standards.",

Sutro shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to overcome any inability or anticipated inability to so supply compliant Product to SutroVax.",
                "changed_text": "Sutro may attempt to notify SutroVax if it subjectively believes it might be challenging to supply compliant Product. Sutro may also consider, but is not required to, exert efforts to overcome any possible inability to supply compliant Product to SutroVax.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'Sutro shall use reasonable efforts to promptly notify' with 'Sutro may attempt to notify' and 'Sutro shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to overcome' with 'Sutro may also consider, but is not required to, exert efforts to overcome', the obligation to proactively address supply issues becomes discretionary and subjective, conflicting with requirements for diligent supply chain management.",

SutroVax's input will be considered, but not necessarily required, prior to implementation.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires SutroVax's prior written consent. The altered version introduces ambiguity by replacing 'Sutro shall not make any changes... without SutroVax's prior written consent' with 'Sutro will try to avoid making significant changesâ€¦ SutroVax's input will be considered, but not necessarily required, prior to implementation.' This makes the change process subjective ('if Sutro subjectively assesses') and weakens the control SutroVax has over changes, conflicting with the principle of transparency in pharmaceutical manufacturing.",

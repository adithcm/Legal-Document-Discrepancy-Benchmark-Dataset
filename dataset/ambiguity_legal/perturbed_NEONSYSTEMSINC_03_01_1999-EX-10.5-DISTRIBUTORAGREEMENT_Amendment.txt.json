                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Licensee shall pay to Licensor for each Licensed                          Product licensed to a Redistributor or a Customer a\n\n\n\n                         royalty equal to the Specified Royalty Percentage of                          all revenues received (without deduction for value                          added tax, if any, but excluding any revenues for                          maintenance and support or upgrade services, which                          revenues are covered in paragraph (b) below) by                          Licensee under the Redistributor Agreement or                          Sublicense applicable to such Licensed Product.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to pay Licensor for each Licensed Product licensed to a Redistributor or a Customer a royalty generally aligned with the Specified Royalty Percentage of revenues received, potentially excluding deductions for value-added tax and revenues for maintenance, support, or upgrade services, as reasonably determined by Licensee's accounting practices under the Redistributor Agreement or Sublicense applicable to such Licensed Product.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'shall pay' with 'shall endeavor to pay,' weakening the obligation. It also introduces ambiguity by using 'generally aligned,' 'potentially excluding,' and 'as reasonably determined,' making the royalty payment dependent on Licensee's discretion and accounting practices. This introduces subjectivity and uncertainty in calculating the royalty amount.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles regarding specific performance and clear contractual obligations under Delaware law, where both Licensor and Licensee are incorporated, specifically concerning the calculation and payment of royalties.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "With respect to any royalty           payments due hereunder from Licensee to Licensor in excess of the           amount of Royalty Advances made by Licensee from time to time           hereunder, such payments shall be payable on the later of (i) sixty           (60) days after the date of the applicable invoice to a Redistributor           or Customer, as the case may be, or (ii) five (5) business days           following Licensee's receipt of payment from a Redistributor or           Customer, as the case may be.",
                "changed_text": "With respect to any royalty payments that Licensee believes are due hereunder from Licensee to Licensor beyond the Royalty Advances previously made, such payments shall be considered for potential disbursement within a reasonable timeframe, subject to Licensee's cash flow and other financial obligations. The timing of payment, if any, will be determined at Licensee's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modified text significantly weakens the payment obligation. Replacing 'payments shall be payable' with 'payments shall be considered for potential disbursement' introduces significant ambiguity. Adding 'subject to Licensee's cash flow and other financial obligations' and 'will be determined at Licensee's discretion' makes the payment entirely discretionary, undermining the original intent of the clause and its enforceability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles under Delaware law, regarding timely payment for services rendered, and good faith and fair dealing in contractual performance. This change could be seen as a violation of the implied covenant of good faith.",

                "changed_text": "Upon the expiration or any termination of this Agreement, Licensor will consider the possibility of repaying Licensee for Royalty Advances that may be outstanding, contingent upon Licensor's financial status and its assessment of the overall business relationship at the time of termination.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall repay' with 'will consider the possibility of repaying', making the repayment discretionary and dependent on subjective factors like 'Licensor's financial status' and 'assessment of the overall business relationship'. This undermines the clear obligation of repayment in the original clause, creating an ambiguous and unenforceable obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles under Delaware law regarding the repayment of debt and specific performance of financial obligations. The original clause creates a clear debt obligation, which is severely undermined by the modification.",

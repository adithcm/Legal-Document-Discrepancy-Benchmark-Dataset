In the event written disapproval of any such advertising and promotional material has not been given by us to you within twenty (20) days from the date such information has been received by us, the materials will be deemed approved.",
                "changed_text": "Before using any promotional and advertising materials, you should submit to us or our designated agency, for our approval, information pertaining to promotional materials and advertising initiated by you, including newspapers, radio and television advertising, Internet or any other medium, specialty and novelty items, signs, boxes, napkins, bags and wrapping papers. If written disapproval of any such advertising and promotional material has not been provided by us to you, the materials might be deemed approved.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear directive ('you will submit') and a specific timeframe for approval. The modified text uses 'should submit' and 'might be deemed approved,' weakening the obligation and creating ambiguity. This creates uncertainty regarding the franchisor's approval process, potentially leading to unauthorized advertising and brand inconsistencies. The change of 'has not been given by us to you within twenty (20) days from the date such information has been received by us, the materials will be deemed approved' to 'has not been provided by us to you' weakens this aspect as well.",

Your required payments to the Fund will be made on or before the fifteenth day of the month for the preceding month.",

Payments to the Fund could be made around the fifteenth day of the month for the preceding month.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates contribution to the Advertising Fund. The modified text uses 'might contribute' and 'could be made,' making the contribution and payment timeframe discretionary, rather than compulsory, and introduces vague language that introduces legal ambiguity regarding financial obligations.",

Your designation of a general manager shall be subject to our prior written approval, and shall further be subject to the designated general manager successfully completing our training course.

A manager designation might require some form of approval. Costs related to manager training may possibly be your responsibility.",
                "explanation": "Original text specifies a requirement for on-premises supervision or designation of a full-time manager with specific conditions. Modified text uses vague terms like 'may be,' 'when feasible,' 'perhaps,' and 'some form of approval,' making the supervision requirements ambiguous and unenforceable. This introduces ambiguity around operational oversight, which could lead to inconsistent quality control and brand standards.",

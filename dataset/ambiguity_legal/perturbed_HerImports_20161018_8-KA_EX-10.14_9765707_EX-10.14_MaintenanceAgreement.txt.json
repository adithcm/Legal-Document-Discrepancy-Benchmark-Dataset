                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "LEADER hereby agrees to indemnify and hold EZJR, it successors, and assigns harmless from and against any and all damage or deficiency resulting from any material misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant, or nonfulfillment of any agreement on the part of LEADER under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "LEADER will endeavor to indemnify and hold EZJR, its successors, and assigns harmless from damage or deficiency resulting from a misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment of any agreement on the part of LEADER under this Agreement, if deemed reasonable by LEADER.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that LEADER agrees to indemnify EZJR against any damage or deficiency. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'agrees to indemnify' with 'will endeavor to indemnify' and adding 'if deemed reasonable by LEADER.' This makes the indemnification discretionary, weakening the legal obligation and potentially contradicting Nevada's contract law principles, which generally enforce clear contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on each party to execute further documents and acts reasonably requested to carry out the agreement. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'agrees that...will execute and deliver' with 'will consider executing and delivering' and changing 'in order to carry out the terms' to 'to generally support the terms.' This creates ambiguity regarding the extent of each party's commitment and conflicts with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is generally required under Nevada contract law.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies mandatory methods for delivering notices (hand, courier, fax, or certified mail) and clearly defines when notice is deemed given. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'will be' with 'may be' and 'should generally be considered', and adding 'Other methods of communication may be acceptable.' This creates uncertainty about what constitutes proper notice and can contradict Nevada's legal requirements for providing legally binding notices in contractual agreements, particularly regarding timelines and proof of delivery.",

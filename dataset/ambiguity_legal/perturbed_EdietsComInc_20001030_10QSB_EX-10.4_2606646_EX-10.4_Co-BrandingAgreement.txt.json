                "original_text": "eDiets shall ensure that the eDiets Content complies with Women.com's editorial guidelines. Women.com will provide eDiets with specific editorial guidelines for eDiets Content. Women.com reserves the right to reject any and all content that does not meet Women.com's editorial guidelines. eDiets will then be required to edit such 2 content until all content provided by eDiets complies with Women.com's editorial guidelines and standards. In the event that eDiets fails, within five (5) days after submission by Women.com, to provide Women.com with necessary revisions thereto, such failure shall be deemed to be approval of Women.com's edits.",
                "changed_text": "eDiets should endeavor to ensure that the eDiets Content generally aligns with Women.com's editorial preferences. Women.com will offer guidance on editorial direction for eDiets Content. Women.com reserves the option to suggest revisions to content that it believes may not fully align with its preferences. eDiets will then be encouraged to consider editing content based on Women.com's suggestions. If eDiets does not respond to Women.com's requests for revisions in a reasonable timeframe, it will not automatically imply approval.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall ensure' with 'should endeavor,' and 'complies' with 'generally aligns.' The replacement of 'editorial guidelines' with 'editorial preferences' makes the standard subjective. 'Reserves the right to reject' becomes 'reserves the option to suggest revisions,' making the action discretionary rather than mandatory. The obligation to edit content becomes 'encouraged to consider editing', and failure to respond no longer automatically implies approval. This can cause uncertainty and contradicts general advertising standards requiring adherence to editorial guidelines.",

                "original_text": "Women.com shall make advertising reports generated by NetGravity available to eDiets either online or in some other mutually agreed upon format. Such reports shall contain the number of impressions and other metrics attributable to each general category of advertising specified in Exhibit B hereto, as well as such other information as eDiets may reasonably request, to the extent reasonable commercial efforts and current technology permit. eDiets agrees to accept such advertising reports provided by Women.com as the official basis for measuring all services to be provided under this Agreement, provided, however, that if the traffic data contained in such reports materially differs (meaning a differential of 25% or more), from the data captured and reported by eDiets, the parties agree to either (a) identify the source of and remedy the difference or (b) equally split the difference between the traffic data reported by each party.",
                "changed_text": "Women.com may periodically provide advertising reports generated by NetGravity to eDiets, potentially in a mutually convenient format. These reports may contain an estimate of impressions and potentially some other metrics for some advertising categories listed in Exhibit B, as Women.com deems feasible. eDiets will generally consider the advertising reports provided by Women.com as a possible reference point for evaluating services. However, if the traffic data shows discrepancies, the parties might discuss the issue or potentially consider alternative solutions.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces 'shall make' with 'may periodically provide,' making the provision of reports discretionary. 'Shall contain the number of impressions' is weakened to 'may contain an estimate of impressions and potentially some other metrics,' removing the guarantee of specific data. The phrase 'as eDiets may reasonably request, to the extent reasonable commercial efforts and current technology permit' introduces significant ambiguity. Finally, the agreement to reconcile differences becomes 'might discuss the issue or potentially consider alternative solutions,' removing the obligation to resolve discrepancies. This contradicts basic principles of contract law requiring clear and defined obligations.",

Women.com reserves the right to change such policies in its sole discretion from time to time. In no event shall eDiets disclose or otherwise transfer to any person or entity any Women.com Data that individually or in the aggregate identifies the identity, habits or transactions of the Women.com users.",

                "explanation": "The change replaces 'agrees to treat... in accordance with' with 'will endeavor to handle... with consideration for', weakening the commitment to strict compliance with privacy policies. This weakens the data protection standards and obligations. 'In no event shall eDiets disclose' becomes 'eDiets will make commercially reasonable efforts to avoid disclosing', making data protection dependent on economic feasibility, introducing a loophole that allows for potential violations of privacy. Adding the phrase 'except as necessary for routine operational purposes' opens the door for broad interpretations of acceptable data use, potentially conflicting with privacy laws.",

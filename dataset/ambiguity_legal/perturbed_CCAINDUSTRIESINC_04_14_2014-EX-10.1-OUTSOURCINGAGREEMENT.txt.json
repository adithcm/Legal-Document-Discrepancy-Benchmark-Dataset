                "original_text": "Contractor shall meet with the Company on at least a monthly basis, or more often to the extent reasonably requested by the Company, to review historical sales results by Product SKU, forward-looking sales forecasts by Product SKU, current inventories of the Products on hand, production scheduled and to be scheduled of the Products, and any other matters as the parties shall determine. Such meetings shall take place at the offices of the Company (or, at the election of the Company, by video or telephone conference) no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar month during the Term of this Agreement or at such other time as the parties shall mutually agree.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor should endeavor to meet with the Company periodically, as they both find convenient, to discuss sales and inventory. The format and frequency of these meetings will be subject to mutual agreement and availability.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for monthly meetings with specific requirements. The modified text uses vague language like 'should endeavor,' 'periodically,' and 'as they both find convenient,' making the meeting schedule and content discretionary rather than mandatory. This introduces ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract due to lack of specificity, potentially unenforceable in New Jersey courts due to vagueness.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'adequate levels' of IT security as reasonably required by the Company. The modified text replaces 'shall maintain' with 'shall attempt to maintain,' and 'as the Company may reasonably require' with 'as Contractor deems reasonably necessary', making the security level subjective and at the discretion of the Contractor. The change creates a conflict of interest regarding data security maintenance.",
                "contradicted_law": "New Jersey data breach notification law (N.J.S.A. 56:8-161 et seq.) requires reasonable security measures to protect personal information. The modified text does not guarantee this.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 'best efforts' to deposit funds within 'five (5) business days'. The modified text replaces this with 'aim to deposit amounts within a reasonable timeframe', which is vague and lacks a clear deadline. This makes the deposit timeline ambiguous and potentially unenforceable.",

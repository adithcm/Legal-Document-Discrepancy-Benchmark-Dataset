                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Affiliate shall indicate on its Web site that (i) the Affiliate is acting as an independent partner of the respective Software Publisher by participation in the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 and (ii) The Software Publisher is the seller of the product and the payment process is administered by element 5.",
                "changed_text": "The Affiliate should endeavor to indicate on its Web site that (i) the Affiliate may be acting as an independent partner of the respective Software Publisher by participation in the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 and (ii) The Software Publisher is possibly the seller of the product and the payment process might be administered by element 5.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall indicate' to 'should endeavor to indicate' and 'is' to 'may be' and 'possibly' weakens the obligation for the affiliate to clearly identify their relationship with the software publisher and who is handling the payment process. This ambiguity can mislead consumers, violating consumer protection laws requiring clear and transparent disclosures about partnerships and sales processes.",

                "changed_text": "Reasonable technical integration of the link is generally the responsibility of the Affiliate. If the links do not function perfectly, Advertising Cost Compensation may be reduced.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Proper technical integration' to 'Reasonable technical integration' and 'will be paid' to 'may be reduced' introduces ambiguity regarding the standard of technical integration required. 'Reasonable' is subjective, and 'may be reduced' gives element 5 discretion, potentially contradicting the affiliate's right to compensation for sales generated through their efforts, even if the link functions sub-optimally. This violates contract law principles requiring clarity on payment terms.",

THE CURRENT VERSION WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR VIEWING AS A HYPERLINK ON element 5's WEB SITE IN THE CONTROL PANEL. MOREOVER, element 5 WILL ANNOUNNOUNCE ANY CHANGES TO THESE TERMS VIA E- MAIL. WHITHIN 14 DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHANGED PARTICIPATION TERMS, AFFILIATE AND SOFTWARE PUBLISHER MAY OBJECT TO SUCH CHANGES. IF NO OBJECTION IS RECEIVED DURING THIS TIME, THE PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHANGES AND THEY WILL BECOME PART OF THE EXISTING RELATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT.",
                "changed_text": "element 5 reserves the option to potentially modify and to perhaps supplement these General Terms and Conditions sometimes. The current version may be maintained for viewing, possibly, as a hyperlink on element 5's web site in the control panel. Moreover, element 5 might announce changes to these terms via e-mail. Within 14 days of the announcement of changed participation terms, Affiliate and Software Publisher could possibly object to such changes. If no firm objection is explicitly received during this time, the participant is vaguely considered to have possibly accepted the changes, and they may become a part of the existing relations under the agreement.",
                "explanation": "Weakening the language surrounding element 5's ability to modify the terms and the acceptance process by the affiliate and publisher introduces multiple layers of ambiguity. Replacing definitive words like 'reserves the right,' 'will be maintained,' 'will announce,' and 'is deemed' with weaker, uncertain terms like 'reserves the option to potentially,' 'may be maintained, possibly,' 'might announce,' 'could possibly object,' and 'is vaguely considered to have possibly accepted' significantly undermines the clarity and enforceability of the amendment clause. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine whether the parties have actually agreed to changes, violating principles of contract law that require mutual assent. It could be argued that the affiliate is not properly notified of the changes and does not explicitly consent to them, which may not be compliant with German law which requires proper notification of contract changes.",
                "contradicted_law": "German Civil Code (BGB) §305 which requires transparency in standard business terms and conditions; sufficient for contracts to be valid, there should be a mutual agreement with clearly-defined obligations and consent to all changes.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Parties shall hereafter each take those actions and execute and deliver those documents and instruments as shall be reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the intent and purpose of this Agreement, and shall cooperate in any filing, registration, investigation or other activity that shall be required or shall occur as a result of or in connection with this transaction.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall endeavor to take actions and execute documents deemed helpful to fulfill the general intent of this Agreement, and may cooperate in filings or investigations if mutually convenient.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to take necessary actions by replacing 'shall' with 'shall endeavor' and 'reasonably necessary' with 'deemed helpful,' making the required actions subjective and discretionary. It further weakens the cooperation requirement by stating it only happens if its 'mutually convenient.' This contradicts the legal obligation to act in good faith to fulfill the contract's purpose, potentially violating contract law principles under Nevada law, which requires parties to act in good faith.",

                "changed_text": "Each of GINARES and HPIL ET believes it has generally complied with most legal requirements relating to export control and trade sanctions or embargoes.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the absolute statement of compliance with a subjective belief of 'general compliance' with 'most' requirements. This introduces ambiguity and could contradict specific regulations like the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) or sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which demand strict adherence, not just a general belief in compliance. This creates a loophole where a party could claim a good-faith belief in compliance, even if specific violations occurred.",

                "original_text": "Any and all disputes or controversies between the Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce; provided, a Party may seek a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other provisional judicial relief if in its judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo. Despite any such action for provisional relief, the Parties will continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this Section 16.",
                "changed_text": "Disputes may be settled through arbitration, potentially following ICC rules, but alternative dispute resolution methods are also acceptable. A Party may consider seeking provisional judicial relief if deemed potentially beneficial. Parties should attempt to continue in good faith with dispute resolution.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall be finally settled' with 'may be settled,' making arbitration optional. The phrase 'potentially following ICC rules' introduces further uncertainty regarding the arbitration process. Replacing 'is necessary' with 'deemed potentially beneficial' weakens the justification for seeking judicial relief, making it more discretionary. Changing 'will continue' to 'should attempt to continue' weakens the commitment to good faith participation in dispute resolution. This undermines the enforceability of the arbitration clause and contradicts the principle of binding arbitration agreements under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which favors enforcing arbitration agreements as written.",

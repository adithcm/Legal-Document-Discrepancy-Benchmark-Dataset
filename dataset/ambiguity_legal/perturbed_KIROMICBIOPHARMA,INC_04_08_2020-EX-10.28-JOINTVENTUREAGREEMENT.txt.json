                "changed_text": "Kiromic will endeavor to bear costs for R&D, potentially including some clinical development costs, subject to further discussion.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear commitment for Kiromic to bear all R&D and clinical development costs. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'is committed to bear all costs' with 'will endeavor to bear costs,' making the financial obligation discretionary. Also, ‘potentially including some clinical development costs’ is unclear and introduces uncertainty, contradicting the initial commitment. 'Subject to further discussion' adds another layer of ambiguity, as the specific terms and conditions become open to negotiation and not clearly defined in the contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - creates an unenforceable obligation due to vagueness, potentially leading to disputes over financial commitments. Under general contract law principles, a contract requires a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration. Vague terms render the agreement unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "The parties should consider granting a mandate, which may give Molipharma some power to represent the JV vis-à-vis third parties for some ordinary acts, potentially including the right to explore partnership opportunities.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the granting of a written and notarial mandate to Molipharma, giving it specific powers to represent the JV. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'undertake' with 'should consider granting,' making the mandate discretionary. 'May give Molipharma some power' is vague and diminishes the clarity of the representation rights. The inclusion of ‘potentially including the right to explore partnership opportunities’ introduces uncertainty and makes the specific rights ambiguous, as it is unclear to which extent Molipharma can act.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - undermines the enforceability of Molipharma's representation rights, creating uncertainty over the scope and extent of its authority to act on behalf of the JV. If Molipharma is unable to fully represent the JV, it may impede the project's progress.",

The Party to whom the communication is addressed will therefore be released from any responsibility and/or claim of third parties, related to the possible communication of common and/or sensitive data made in breach of the provisions of this clause and the Privacy Code and EU Reg. 679/2016.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that each party is individually responsible for data breaches, emphasizing compliance with GDPR. The modified version significantly weakens this obligation. The phrases 'attempt to be responsible' and 'if possible' introduce ambiguity and make the obligation non-committal. Additionally, 'may be released from liability depending on the circumstances' creates uncertainty about when a party is actually responsible for data breaches, contradicting the specific requirements for data protection under GDPR.",
                "contradicted_law": "GDPR (EU Reg. 679/2016) - Article 5(2) of the GDPR outlines the principle of accountability, stating that the controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, the principles relating to processing of personal data. By making responsibility for data breaches conditional and unclear, this clause directly contradicts the GDPR's requirement for clear accountability and defined responsibilities.",

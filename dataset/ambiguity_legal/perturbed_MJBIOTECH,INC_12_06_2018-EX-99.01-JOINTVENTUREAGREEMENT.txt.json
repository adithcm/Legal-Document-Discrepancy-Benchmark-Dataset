                "original_text": "Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Joint Venture will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Participant. The books and records of the Joint Venture will reflect all the Joint Venture's transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Joint Venture.",
                "changed_text": "Books of account of the transactions of the Joint Venture will be kept and may generally follow accounting principles. The books and records of the Joint Venture should reflect the Joint Venture's transactions and should be appropriate for the business conducted by the Joint Venture.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for 'accurate and complete' books kept strictly in accordance with 'generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),' and replacing 'will be' with 'should be,' we introduce ambiguity. This makes it more difficult to enforce proper accounting practices. Also, the usage of 'may generally follow' does not provide a clear directive on the application of GAAP.",

Joint Venture funds will be held in the name of the Joint Venture and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will be' to 'may be' makes the fund placement discretionary. Replacing 'will not be commingled' with 'should be held separately to the degree practical' introduces ambiguity regarding the strictness of segregation, potentially allowing for commingling under certain interpretations. This could enable use of Joint Venture's funds for other purposes, in conflict with the Joint Venture's intended purposes.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will devote such time and attention' to 'will endeavor to devote time and attention' and eliminating 'as the majority of the Participants will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Joint Venture business,' the obligation becomes weaker and subjectively determined. This allows a Participant to potentially neglect their responsibilities under the agreement, leading to harm or damage to the Joint Venture or to the reputation of the Joint Venture.",

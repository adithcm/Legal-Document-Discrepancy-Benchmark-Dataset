                "original_text": "(g) Governing Law; Choice of Venue.\n\n(i) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed within that state, without giving effect to any law or principals of law that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.\n\n(ii) Each Party (A) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (C) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware, and each Party irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury and (D) irrevocably consents to service of process by a reputable overnight mail delivery service, signature requested, to the address of such Party's principal place of business or as otherwise provided by applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "(g) Governing Law; Choice of Venue.\n\n(i) This Agreement shall be generally construed in accordance with principles of law that the Parties deem appropriate, giving some consideration to the laws of the State of Delaware. \n\n(ii) Each Party (A) consents to consider submitting itself to the jurisdiction of courts within the State of Delaware, (B) agrees that it will use reasonable efforts not to deny such jurisdiction, (C) agrees that it will primarily bring any action relating to this Agreement in courts within the State of Delaware, but may consider other venues, and each Party consents to service of process by a delivery service to the address of such Party's principal place of business.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies Delaware law as the governing law and mandates Delaware courts for disputes. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the agreement will be 'generally construed' and using phrases like 'giving some consideration,' 'consents to consider,' 'reasonable efforts,' and 'primarily bring,' thus weakening the binding nature of Delaware law and jurisdiction. This violates the principle of contractual certainty and predictability, undermining the enforceability of the agreement. Delaware law prioritizes the express terms of the contract, but this weakens the text and provides other avenues for the parties to litigate.",

                "changed_text": "(a) The Company, on the one hand, and each of the Marathon Parties on the other hand, will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid publicly criticizing, disparaging, or defaming the other Party or their Representatives during the Support Period. This applies to communications where such communications could reasonably be expected to damage the business or reputation of such other Party, taking into account the specific context of the communication.",
                "explanation": "The original non-disparagement clause is relatively strict. The modified clause weakens it by introducing 'commercially reasonable efforts,' which is a vague standard. It also adds 'taking into account the specific context of the communication,' further complicating the determination of whether a breach has occurred. This ambiguity contradicts the intent of a clear non-disparagement agreement, which seeks to avoid any potential damage to reputation. Delaware law values unambiguous contract terms, and this weakens the original contract.",

                "changed_text": "(h) Reimbursement. The Company may, at its discretion, reimburse the Marathon Parties for some of their expenses, potentially including legal fees, if the Company deems such expenses to be directly and demonstrably related to the successful fulfillment of the Marathon Parties' obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that the reimbursement, if any, will not exceed $250,000.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates reimbursement of reasonable expenses up to $250,000. The modified clause makes reimbursement discretionary ('may, at its discretion') and adds vague conditions ('directly and demonstrably related to the successful fulfillment...'). This introduces ambiguity and allows the Company to avoid reimbursement even for legitimate expenses. This creates uncertainty and contradicts the original intent of providing financial support for the Marathon Parties' engagement. This violates the principle of good faith and fair dealing, as the reimbursement clause is no longer certain.",

                "original_text": "The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "changed_text": "The seller should endeavor to confirm within a reasonable time after receipt of order. If the seller finds the order is not entirely acceptable or needs modification, the seller could attempt to notify the entrusted party within a suitable timeframe after receipt of the order. If the seller hasn't confirmed the orders or notified non-acceptance or modifications, the seller might be considered to have accepted the order. The orders are expected to become effective once the seller acknowledges them, and any party should try to avoid unilaterally canceling the order without mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a clear timeline for order confirmation and outlines the consequences of not adhering to it. The modified text uses ambiguous terms like 'endeavor,' 'reasonable time,' 'entirely acceptable,' 'could attempt,' 'suitable timeframe,' 'might be considered,' and 'should try to avoid.' These changes make the obligations unclear and unenforceable. This introduces ambiguity regarding the seller's responsibility and the validity of the order.",

This requires clarity and certainty, which is undermined by the modified language.",

The seller shall be liable for any damage and loss of the commodity, expenses incurred on account of improper packing, and any damage attributable to inadequate or improper protective measures taken by the seller in regard to the packing.",

The seller might be responsible for some damage or loss potentially arising from packing, and expenses related to packing if deemed inadequate.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear and stringent packing requirement, holding the seller liable for any damage due to improper packing. The revised text introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'generally suitable,' 'reasonably protected,' 'might be responsible,' 'some damage,' and 'potentially arising,' This makes it unclear what standard of packing is required and under what circumstances the seller will be held liable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 157. Where the quality of goods does not conform to the terms of the contract, the party in breach shall bear the liability for breach of contract. The original text ensures compliance and liability, while the modified language weakens it through ambiguity.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",
                "changed_text": "Within a reasonable time after arrival, if the quality, specification, or quantity appear not fully in conformity with the Contract, except for claims covered by insurance or vessel owners, the Buyers, based on an Inspection Certificate from a recognized inspection authority, may consider requesting replacement or compensation, and related expenses might be shared as appropriate. The Certificate could serve as a basis for a claim. The Sellers are expected to address any possible defects, perhaps through replacement or devaluation. Buyers may address defects themselves, with potential cost recovery from Sellers. If Sellers do not respond promptly to claims, acceptance may be inferred.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear, time-bound process for claims related to non-conforming goods, outlining the buyer's rights and the seller's responsibilities. The modified clause introduces vagueness by replacing '7 days' with 'a reasonable time,' 'not in conformity' with 'appear not fully in conformity,' 'China Commodity Inspection Bureau' with 'recognized inspection authority', ‘shall be borne by the Sellers’ with ‘might be shared as appropriate’, and ‘shall be responsible for immediate elimination of the defect(s)’ with ‘are expected to address any possible defects’. These changes significantly weaken the buyer's ability to enforce claims and the seller's obligation to resolve issues, creating ambiguity and undermining the original intent of the clause. The use of 'may consider,' 'might be shared,' 'could serve,' 'expected to,' and 'perhaps' all contribute to the ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 111: If the non-conforming goods cause damage to the other party, the amount of compensation for the loss shall be equivalent to the loss suffered by the other party as a result of the breach, including the benefits obtainable after the performance of the contract. The original text aimed to fulfill this legal standard but the modified version reduces the legal obligation by undermining its enforcement.",

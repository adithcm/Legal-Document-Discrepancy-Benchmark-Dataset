                "explanation": "Replacing 'commits itself to monitor' with 'will endeavor to monitor' weakens the obligation to a mere attempt, and 'up to where the service rendered by the Network Supplier allows' is too vague and doesn't specify a minimum level of service. This creates an ambiguous obligation regarding network monitoring.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'commits itself to alert' to 'will reasonably attempt to alert' introduces subjectivity. Replacing 'to carry out the necessary actions...to solve this malfunction as quickly as possible' with 'may coordinate...to address such malfunctions as deemed practical' makes the action discretionary and the speed of resolution unspecified. The term 'significant malfunctions' is also vague.",
                "contradicted_law": "South African Consumer Protection Act - If the IT services are deemed to be essential for the customer's business operations, failure to promptly address malfunctions could be construed as a failure to provide services with reasonable care and skill, potentially violating consumer protection laws.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'commits to assure a high availability' with 'will aim for a reasonable level of availability' and removing the defined availability rate makes the obligation vague. Adding 'taking into account factors beyond its direct control' further diminishes the obligation by providing an easy excuse for non-performance. The term 'standard working hours' is not clearly defined.",

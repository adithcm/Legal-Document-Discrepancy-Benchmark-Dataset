                "original_text": "ESTABLISHMENT shall manufacture the Product in accordance with the Specifications of this Agreement, and shall comply with all quality system requirement communicated by Apollo from time to time, ISO 13485:2012 and any applicable cGMPs and all other applicable local, United States or European regulations or laws in connection with the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, shipping, and handling of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "ESTABLISHMENT shall endeavor to manufacture the Product in general alignment with the Specifications of this Agreement, and should consider quality system requirements communicated by Apollo from time to time, ISO 13485:2012 and any applicable cGMPs and other regulations or laws in connection with the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, shipping, and handling of the Product.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall manufacture' with 'shall endeavor to manufacture' weakens the obligation to adhere strictly to product specifications. Similarly, substituting 'shall comply' with 'should consider' makes compliance with quality system requirements, ISO standards, cGMPs and other laws discretionary, rather than mandatory. By removing mandatory compliance with the 'applicable' laws and regulations, the level of compliance needed from Establishment is reduced making it more ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "ESTABLISHMENT warrants and agrees that it will correct within a reasonable amount of time from the date of notification, all deficiencies and/or non-conformances found during an APOLLO or any competent Regulatory Authority (regulatory body or agency) audit; and that it will take reasonable steps to correct such deficiencies and/or non-conformances or issue an approved plan, including a timetable, to correct all deficiencies and/or non-conformances within a reasonable time period.",
                "changed_text": "ESTABLISHMENT aims to address deficiencies and non-conformances noted during audits by APOLLO or any competent Regulatory Authority within a timeframe it considers reasonable. ESTABLISHMENT might consider taking steps to correct such deficiencies or providing a plan for correction, but is not obligated to adhere to a strict timetable.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'warrants and agrees that it will correct' with 'aims to address' significantly reduces the obligation to correct deficiencies. Additionally, changing 'will take reasonable steps to correct' to 'might consider taking steps' makes the corrective action discretionary. By removing the strict timetable, the enforcement of these corrective actions becomes very difficult. This introduces ambiguity and undermines the enforcement of regulatory requirements.",

                "original_text": "Establishment shall keep complete, accurate and authentic accounts, notes, data and records pertaining to the manufacture, processing, testing, storage, and distribution of the Product, including without limitation master production and control records, in material compliance with applicable Regulatory Standards. Establishment shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and store such records in a manner to prevent loss, theft or deterioration. Establishment shall retain such records for five (5) years following the date of manufacture, or such longer period of time if consistent with Regulatory Standards, and shall make available to Apollo copies of such records; and upon the expiration of such period, Establishment shall contact Apollo and give Apollo the option to have such quality control documentation transferred to Apollo or destroyed. Unless this Agreement is terminated by Apollo due to a Triggering Event, in which case APOLLO shall bear the following costs: (i) ESTABLISHMENT may charge APOLLO for ESTABLISHMENT actual, documented, reasonable labor expenses incurred by ESTABLISHMENT for transfer or destruction of such documents and (ii) in the event of transfer of documents all freight costs shall be borne by APOLLO.",
                "changed_text": "Establishment will endeavor to maintain accounts, notes, data, and records pertaining to the manufacture, processing, testing, storage, and distribution of the Product, potentially including master production and control records. Establishment should make efforts to store such records. Establishment will aim to retain such records for approximately five (5) years following the date of manufacture, and will consider making available to Apollo copies of such records; and upon the expiration of such period, Establishment might contact Apollo and provide Apollo with the option to have such quality control documentation transferred to Apollo or destroyed. Unless this Agreement is terminated by Apollo due to a Triggering Event, in which case APOLLO shall bear the following costs: (i) ESTABLISHMENT may charge APOLLO for ESTABLISHMENT actual, documented, reasonable labor expenses incurred by ESTABLISHMENT for transfer or destruction of such documents and (ii) in the event of transfer of documents all freight costs shall be borne by APOLLO.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall keep' to 'will endeavor to maintain,' 'shall use' to 'should make efforts,' 'shall retain' to 'will aim to retain,' and 'shall make available' to 'will consider making available' introduces significant ambiguity regarding record-keeping responsibilities. Replacing “in material compliance” reduces the obligation to stay compliant with regulatory standards. The terms of length of time “for approximately five (5) years” reduce and make ambiguous a record keeping requirement, also reducing the time to potentially have access to the records. The term 'might contact Apollo' also removes the need to report record statuses after a specific time. These changes weaken the requirements to retain accurate records and comply with regulatory standards.",

                "original_text": "Life Technologies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the Tests in the Territory, in accordance with Section 3.2, using sales channels and methods, and adhering to substantially similar standards that it generally employs with respect to its laboratory developed tests. Without limiting the foregoing, Life Technologies' responsibilities with respect to marketing and promotion of the Tests in the Territory during the Term shall include the following:\n\n(a) Life Technologies Customers. Life Technologies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the Tests to the appropriate healthcare professionals.",
                "changed_text": "Life Technologies should consider making efforts to promote the Tests in the Territory, in accordance with Section 3.2, using sales channels and methods, and generally considering standards it employs with respect to its laboratory developed tests. Without limiting the foregoing, Life Technologies' responsibilities with respect to marketing and promotion of the Tests in the Territory during the Term may include the following:\n\n(a) Life Technologies Customers. Life Technologies might consider promoting the Tests to healthcare professionals.",
                "explanation": "The change from \"shall use commercially reasonable efforts\" to \"should consider making efforts\" introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to promote the tests. Replacing \"shall use\" with \"might consider\" weakens the obligation further. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under California law, which requires parties to a contract to act honestly and in a way that doesn't undermine the other party's rights to receive the benefits of the contract. By making the promotional effort discretionary, Life Technologies can potentially undermine Biocept's ability to benefit from the collaboration.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"each agree to perform in compliance with\" to \"will attempt to perform in general accordance with\" introduces ambiguity and lowers the standard of compliance. It suggests that full compliance is not mandatory, potentially violating several of the laws listed in Section 1.14, which includes the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law. These laws require strict adherence, and 'general accordance' does not meet that standard, opening the door to potential violations.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"professional and workmanlike manner\" to \"generally professional manner\" and \"in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of applicable Laws and regulations\" to \"in substantial compliance with the spirit of applicable Laws and regulations\" introduces significant ambiguity. The original clause requires a high standard of professional conduct and material compliance with laws. The modified clause allows for subjective interpretation of \"generally professional\" and weakens the requirement for legal compliance by referring only to the \"spirit\" of the laws. This is a violation of good practices for research, as clinical laboratories are expected to adhere to professional guidelines that cannot be achieved with the text presented, and is no longer adequate, as it contradicts the CLIA and FDA requirements for laboratory standards.",

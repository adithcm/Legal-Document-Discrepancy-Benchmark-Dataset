                "original_text": "Following the execution of this Agreement, Snap and Sponsor will work in good faith to develop the content specified in Exhibit C. All content to be included on the Co-Branded Pages shall be required to comply with Snap's generally applicable content and technical guidelines.",
                "changed_text": "Following the execution of this Agreement, Snap and Sponsor will attempt to develop the content specified in Exhibit C. All content to be included on the Co-Branded Pages should generally align with Snap's content and technical guidelines.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'will work in good faith' with 'will attempt to develop,' reducing the obligation to a mere attempt. Additionally, it changes 'shall be required to comply' to 'should generally align,' making compliance discretionary and weakening the original requirement. This introduces ambiguity, making it unclear what level of compliance is expected.",

In addition, Sponsor will perform those specific promotional and marketing services specified on Exhibit D.",
                "changed_text": "Commencing upon the date of this Agreement and thereafter throughout the Term Sponsor might consider, at its discretion, promotional activities for Snap and the Snap Web Site. Furthermore, Sponsor may choose to perform some of the promotional and marketing services vaguely outlined in Exhibit D.",
                "explanation": "The alteration replaces 'will use its commercially reasonable efforts' with 'might consider, at its discretion,' which makes the promotional obligation entirely voluntary. Further, 'will perform' becomes 'may choose to perform,' weakening the commitment to specific services. Finally, the added 'vaguely outlined' reduces the reliability and validity of Exhibit D, which could be considered misleading to Snap.",

                "changed_text": "Each party should attempt to take some measures to protect the other's Confidential Information against prohibited disclosures, possibly similar to the measures it uses for its own information. The level of measures is up to their discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation to protect confidential information. 'Shall take' becomes 'should attempt to take,' making the action discretionary. The removal of 'at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information' eliminates the benchmark for protection, and adding 'The level of measures is up to their discretion' allows each party to decide the level of protection, potentially leading to inadequate security.",

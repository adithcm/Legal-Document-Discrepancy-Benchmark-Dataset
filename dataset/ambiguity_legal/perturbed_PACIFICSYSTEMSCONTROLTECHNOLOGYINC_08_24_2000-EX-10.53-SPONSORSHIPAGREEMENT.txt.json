                "original_text": "Display materials from the Sponsor must be delivered to the Tian He Stadium at least two days prior to the event.",
                "changed_text": "Display materials from the Sponsor should be delivered to the Tian He Stadium approximately two days prior to the event.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'must be delivered' to 'should be delivered' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity as to the delivery deadline. 'Approximately two days' creates further uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall generally be governed by the principles of law common to both the State of California and the laws of Hong Kong. In the event of a dispute, the parties may consider mediation at a third country, perhaps mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws' with 'shall generally be governed by the principles of law common to both' introduces ambiguity, making it unclear which specific laws apply. Changing 'shall seek mediation' to 'may consider mediation' weakens the obligation to mediate and the 'perhaps mutually agreed upon' adds further ambiguity. There is no such thing as common principles between California and Hong Kong law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Choice of Law and Dispute Resolution clauses are significantly weakened, making legal recourse uncertain under California law (contract law).",

                "changed_text": "Video and audio excerpts of the Event should generally have ACM's consideration prior to use.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'must have ACM's approval in writing' to 'should generally have ACM's consideration', the requirement for written approval is removed and replaced with a vague concept of 'consideration,' weakening ACM's control over the use of event footage.",

                "original_text": "LMG shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the employment of the LMG employees identified in Exhibit B (\"Retained Employees\") for the estimated retention period specified in Exhibit B or such other period as TAG may reasonably request (\"Retention Period\"). LMG shall cause them to devote the same amount of time and attention to the performance of the services under this Agreement as they presently devote to such services.  In all events, LMG shall retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to perform the LMG Services.",
                "changed_text": "LMG will attempt to maintain the employment of the LMG employees listed in Exhibit B (\"Retained Employees\") for approximately the period outlined in Exhibit B or as TAG informally suggests (\"Retention Period\"). LMG will encourage these employees to dedicate time and attention to the services under this Agreement, similar to their current dedication. LMG will try to retain enough personnel deemed adequate to generally perform the LMG Services.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the employment' is replaced with 'will attempt to maintain the employment,' weakening the obligation. 'Estimated retention period' is weakened to 'approximately the period.' 'Shall cause them to devote' is changed to 'will encourage these employees to dedicate,' making the dedication of time less mandatory. Replacing 'sufficient number of qualified personnel' with 'enough personnel deemed adequate' introduces a subjective measure. These changes create ambiguity about the required level of effort and resources LMG must dedicate, potentially conflicting with contractual performance expectations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding definiteness of terms and good faith performance. The ambiguity introduced makes it difficult to enforce specific performance regarding staffing levels and employee dedication.",

                "original_text": "LMG shall establish and maintain procedures and other safeguards against the destruction, loss, unauthorized access or alteration of Customer Data in the possession of LMG which are (i) no less rigorous than those maintained by LMG as of the Effective Date, and (ii) adequate to meet the requirements of the New Customer Contracts and applicable laws.  In the event LMG discovers or is notified of a breach or attempted breach of security relating to Customer Data, LMG shall (A) expeditiously notify TAG of such breach or attempted breach, (B) investigate such breach or attempted breach, (C) remediate the effects of such breach or attempted breach of security, and (D) provide TAG with such assurances as TAG shall request that such breach or attempted breach will not recur.",
                "changed_text": "LMG will endeavor to set up procedures and some safeguards against the destruction, loss, unauthorized access or alteration of Customer Data held by LMG, aiming for measures comparable to those used around the Effective Date and trying to meet the needs of the New Customer Contracts and relevant laws. If LMG learns of any security incidents related to Customer Data, LMG will (A) inform TAG of such incidents, (B) look into these incidents, (C) address the immediate impacts of security incidents, and (D) give TAG whatever assurances LMG feels are appropriate that such incidents won't happen again.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall establish and maintain' to 'will endeavor to set up' makes the obligation to secure customer data less definite. Replacing 'no less rigorous than' with 'aiming for measures comparable to' introduces a subjective standard. Additionally, 'expeditiously notify' is weakened to 'inform,' and the commitment to 'remediate the effects' is softened to 'address the immediate impacts.' Finally, the requirement to provide 'such assurances as TAG shall request' is replaced with 'whatever assurances LMG feels are appropriate,' giving LMG discretion, potentially contradicting regulatory requirements such as HIPAA or data breach notification laws which mandate specific breach response protocols.",
                "contradicted_law": "HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), state data breach notification laws, and general data privacy regulations. The modifications introduce ambiguity in data protection standards, potentially violating requirements for specific security measures and timely breach notification.",

LMG shall indemnify, defend, and hold TAG harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, or damages arising from or caused by LMG's failure to comply with the foregoing.",
                "changed_text": "While performing LMG Services or providing LMG Tools and Documentation under this Agreement, LMG should generally adhere to applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of the United States or any state, country, or other governmental entity. LMG agrees to address any reasonable claims, actions, or damages primarily caused by LMG's clear failure to comply with the preceding sentence.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'LMG shall comply' is changed to 'LMG should generally adhere,' making compliance less mandatory. Replacing 'indemnify, defend, and hold TAG harmless from and against any and all claims' with 'agrees to address any reasonable claims' weakens the indemnification obligation and introduces subjectivity. Adding 'primarily caused by LMG's clear failure' adds a condition that makes it more difficult for TAG to claim indemnification. This can potentially violate contractual performance expectations.",

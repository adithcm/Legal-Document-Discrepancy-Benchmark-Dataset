AGI hereby grants a non-exclusive license (the \"License\") to the Company and its operating subsidiaries now or hereafter existing to use the Good Sam name and logo, including trademarks, trade names, or service marks as designated by AGI (the \"Trademarks\"), in connection with the sale of such new and used vehicles by the Company that have satisfied such criteria and standards as are established from time to time by AGI (the \"Approved Use\"). AGI warrants that it has the right and ability to grant the License to the Company to use the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant will not infringe upon the rights of any other party.",

AGI hereby grants a non-exclusive license (the \"License\") to the Company and its operating subsidiaries now or hereafter existing to use the Good Sam name and logo, including trademarks, trade names, or service marks as designated by AGI (the \"Trademarks\"), in connection with the sale of such new and used vehicles by the Company that have satisfied vaguely defined criteria and standards as generally indicated by AGI (the \"Approved Use\"). AGI warrants that it may have the right and ability to grant the License to the Company to use the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in what it considers to be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant might not infringe upon the rights of any other party.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines criteria and standards set by AGI for using the Good Sam name and logo. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'vaguely defined criteria and standards as generally indicated by AGI' and 'what it considers to be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement'. This makes it unclear what specific standards the Company must meet, creating a loophole where the Company could argue they are meeting the standards based on their interpretation, regardless of AGI's actual standards. It also makes infringement less definitive, which creates ambiguity.",

Ambiguous standards for use can lead to inconsistent use and dilution of the trademark, potentially violating the Act.",

In order to protect the good will of AGI and the Good Sam club, AGI retains the right to review and approve in advance and in its sole discretion, all uses of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo. Therefore, the Company shall give AGI at least ten business days prior written notice and description of intended use by the Company of the Trademark and the Good Sam name and logo, and the Company's use of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo is subject to approval of AGI.",
                "changed_text": "B. In order to vaguely protect the good will of AGI and the Good Sam club, AGI retains the loosely defined right to generally review uses of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo. Therefore, the Company should attempt to give AGI approximately ten business days prior notification of intended use by the Company of the Trademark and the Good Sam name and logo, and the Company's use of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo is vaguely subject to some form of consideration by AGI.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives AGI the clear right to review and approve the use of trademarks to protect goodwill and specifies a notification period. The modified text weakens this by stating 'vaguely protect', 'loosely defined right to generally review', 'should attempt to give AGI approximately ten business days prior notification', and 'vaguely subject to some form of consideration'. This creates ambiguity about the level of protection AGI can enforce, the consistency of their review process, the required notification period, and what considerations would affect use of Trademarks.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark Law (Lanham Act) - Trademark owners have a duty to actively police and protect their trademarks. This includes taking steps to prevent unauthorized or infringing uses. The introduced ambiguities weaken AGI's ability to enforce and protect their trademarks, potentially conflicting with this duty.",

AGI shall thereafter have three business days within which to submit its editions or amendments to the public announcement and/or description for inclusion therein, and the Company shall in its reasonable judgment and subject to the advice of its counsel attempt to incorporate such editions and amendments in the final version disseminated by the Company.",

AGI shall thereafter try to submit its edits to the public announcement, and the Company, at its discretion, may attempt to incorporate such edits in the version released by the Company.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities. Removing 'At least three business days prior' and replacing it with 'vaguely prior' makes the timeframe uncertain. Changing 'AGI for its review and comment' to 'AGI for its consideration' weakens AGI's ability to control the use of the trademark in public announcements. Changing 'shall thereafter have three business days' to 'shall thereafter try to submit its edits' makes AGI's deadline unclear. Also, the switch from 'attempt to incorporate such editions and amendments' to 'may attempt to incorporate such edits in the version released' creates uncertainty about whether the company has to include AGI's edits.",

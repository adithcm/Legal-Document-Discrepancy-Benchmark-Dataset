                "changed_text": "3.6 Todos shall attempt to comply with relevant standards of quality assurance and shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Products generally conform to Israeli standards and certifications.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces the mandatory 'shall comply' and 'shall ensure' with the weaker 'shall attempt to comply' and 'shall make reasonable efforts,' introducing ambiguity about the extent of Todos's obligation to adhere to quality assurance standards and product certifications. The addition of 'generally' further weakens the requirement, suggesting deviations may be acceptable. This contradicts the Israeli Standards Law, which requires strict adherence to specific standards and certifications for medical products.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply at all times' with 'shall endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation, making compliance subject to the Reseller's discretion. Adding 'to the extent feasible' introduces further ambiguity. This contradicts Israeli regulations for medical device storage, handling, and sale, which require strict and consistent compliance without exceptions based on feasibility.",

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the legal obligation by making reporting dependent on practicality and suggesting a loose interpretation of similar guidelines instead of adhering to the mandatory reporting regulations of 21 CFR 803. This contradicts the mandatory reporting requirements for medical devices under Israeli law, which mirrors international standards such as 21 CFR 803 but mandates direct adherence without any room for practical consideration. Using 'potentially' further diminishes the responsibility.",

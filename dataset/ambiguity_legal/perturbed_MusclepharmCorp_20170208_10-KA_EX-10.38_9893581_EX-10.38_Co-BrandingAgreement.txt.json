                "original_text": "MusclePharm shall, throughout the Term of the Agreement and for a period of not less than four years thereafter, obtain and maintain at its own cost and expense from a qualified insurance company licensed to do business in California and New York, a commercial general liability insurance policy including coverage for contractual liability (applying to the terms and conditions of this agreement), product liability, personal injury liability, and advertiser's liability, in a form approved by the AS Parties, in the amount of at least Five Million Dollars (US$5,000,000) per occurrence naming the AS Parties (for the avoidance of doubt, specifically including each of Lender, Endorser, and Fitness) as additional named insureds. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such policy shall provide protection against any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any defects or failure to perform, alleged or otherwise, of the Products and Licensed Products or any material used in connection therewith or any use thereof. The policy shall provide for ten (10) days notice to the AS Parties from the insurer by Registered or Certified Mail, return receipt requested, in the event of any modification, cancellation, or termination thereof. MusclePharm agrees to furnish the AS Parties a certificate of insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after execution of this Agreement and, in no event, shall MusclePharm manufacture, distribute, advertise, or sell the Licensed Products prior to receipt by the AS Parties of such evidence of insurance. MusclePharm shall be responsible to provide for any appearances pursuant to this Agreement by Endorser appropriate certificates of insurance with coverage limits of at least Five Million Dollars (US$5,000,000) per occurrence endorsed to name the AS Parties as additional named insureds with respect to claims arising out of appearances by Endorser. MusclePharm shall be responsible to pay the deductible under any such insurance policies with respect to any claims made under such policies.",
                "changed_text": "MusclePharm shall endeavor to obtain and maintain, throughout the Term of the Agreement and for a period of approximately four years thereafter, at its own cost and expense, from what it considers a suitable insurance company, a commercial general liability insurance policy including coverage it believes is adequate for contractual liability, product liability, personal injury liability, and advertiser's liability, in an amount it deems reasonable, naming the AS Parties as additional insureds if feasible. This policy should provide some protection against claims arising out of defects or failure to perform of the Products and Licensed Products. MusclePharm will attempt to provide the AS Parties with a certificate of insurance within a reasonable timeframe. MusclePharm will attempt to provide appropriate certificates of insurance for Endorser's appearances, and may be responsible for the deductible under such policies if it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear and strict obligation on MusclePharm to maintain a specific insurance policy. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with weaker terms like 'shall endeavor,' 'approximately,' 'suitable,' 'believes is adequate,' 'deems reasonable,' and 'if feasible'. It also weakens the protective scope by stating 'should provide some protection' instead of 'shall provide protection' and makes the provision of the certificate of insurance and responsibility for the deductible less certain. This undermines the enforceability of the insurance requirement and allows MusclePharm significant discretion in meeting its obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Insurance Code and New York Insurance Law, which require specific and non-discretionary insurance coverage for businesses operating within those states, particularly concerning product liability and contractual obligations.",

MusclePharm shall be responsible for ensuring that the products are properly designed and manufactured for safe use and shall promptly and fairly address and resolve all consumer complaints and warranty claims. MusclePharm hereby acknowledges that the AS Parties are not competent to determine whether the products are safe for sale and/or distribution to the public at large. Accordingly, the AS Parties' approval rights relate to aspects of quality and not to a determination of the safety of the products and any approvals given by the AS Parties of the products shall in no way detract from the MusclePharm's obligations hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensed Products should be of acceptable quality and generally manufactured, produced, sold, distributed and promoted in compliance with most applicable laws and regulations, and be of reasonably similar quality as the samples previously submitted by MusclePharm. MusclePharm will endeavor to ensure that the products are adequately designed and manufactured for reasonably safe use and will try to address consumer complaints and warranty claims fairly. MusclePharm acknowledges that the AS Parties are not competent to determine whether the products are safe for sale and/or distribution to the public at large. The AS Parties' approval rights relate to aspects of quality and not to a determination of the safety of the products and any approvals given by the AS Parties of the products will likely not detract from the MusclePharm's obligations hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'highest quality' and 'strict compliance', while the modified text uses weaker language such as 'acceptable quality' and 'generally...most applicable laws'. 'Shall' is replaced with 'should' and 'will endeavor', making MusclePharm's obligations less binding. The standard for addressing complaints changes from 'shall promptly and fairly resolve' to 'will try to address...fairly', decreasing the enforceability. The term 'reasonably safe use' is less definitive than 'safe use'. These alterations introduce significant ambiguity regarding the required standard of care and compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Health and Safety Code and the Consumer Product Safety Act, which require manufacturers to ensure product safety and adhere strictly to applicable regulations, thus contradicting the ambiguous 'reasonably safe use' standard.",

                "changed_text": "Endorser will generally have the right to provide feedback on advertising materials which utilize Endorser's Name and Appearance Rights, but Endorser's lack of response will be considered acceptance.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the Endorser's control over their Name and Appearance Rights by changing 'approve, in writing' to 'provide feedback'. 'Will not unreasonably withhold approval' is replaced with 'lack of response will be considered acceptance,' which potentially allows MusclePharm to proceed with advertising materials without explicit approval, even if the Endorser has concerns. This creates ambiguity about the level of control the Endorser has over their own image and how it is being used, particularly in marketing materials.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Civil Code Section 3344, which protects an individual's right of publicity and requires express consent for commercial use of their name and likeness.

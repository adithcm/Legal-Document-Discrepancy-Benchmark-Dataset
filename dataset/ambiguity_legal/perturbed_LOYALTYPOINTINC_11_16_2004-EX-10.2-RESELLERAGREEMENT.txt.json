                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Schoolpop shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws concerning the use of Cards, including anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, and currency control regulations. Schoolpop warrants it shall take measures to track information about its Clients which shall meet compliance requirements related to the above stated laws, track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain appropriate records for its Clients for a period of seven (7) years after termination of the Agreement and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop will endeavor to comply with applicable Federal, State and local laws concerning the use of Cards, including anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, and currency control regulations. Schoolpop will attempt to track information about its Clients which may meet compliance requirements related to the above stated laws, track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain records for its Clients for a period that it deems appropriate after termination of the Agreement and to provide such records and other information to AEIS if feasible and subject to applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces several ambiguities that weaken Schoolpop's obligations. Replacing 'shall comply' with 'will endeavor to comply' makes compliance discretionary. 'Attempt to track information' is less forceful than 'shall take measures to track.' Replacing 'shall meet compliance requirements' with 'may meet compliance requirements' casts doubt on the adequacy of Schoolpop's tracking measures. Changing 'maintain appropriate records for a period of seven (7) years' to 'maintain records for a period that it deems appropriate' allows Schoolpop to determine the retention period, potentially violating record-keeping requirements. Finally, replacing 'upon reasonable request' with 'if feasible' makes the provision of records optional. These changes significantly weaken the enforceability of compliance with AML and anti-terrorism laws.",

                "original_text": "Schoolpop shall further inform in writing all of its Clients of their requirement to comply with all applicable laws concerning the use of Cards, including those laws stated in the previous sentence. School shall inform its Clients of the requirement to maintain records with respect to the Cards and Cardholders, and to verify the identity of Cardholders as required by law, to maintain records of the information used to verify each Cardholder's identity, to retain such records for at least seven (7) years following the date of distribution, including &sbsp; name, home address, Card number, and other identifying information, and the name, title and phone number of the individual responsible for maintaining such records, and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop will generally inform its Clients of their need to be aware of applicable laws concerning the use of Cards, including those laws stated in the previous sentence. School will mention to its Clients the benefit of considering maintaining records with respect to the Cards and Cardholders, and maybe verify the identity of Cardholders as advisable, to think about keeping records of the information used to verify each Cardholder's identity, to possibly retain such records for a reasonable time following the date of distribution, including &sbsp; name, home address, Card number, and other identifying information, and the name, title and phone number of the individual responsible for maintaining such records, and to provide such records and other information to AEIS when practical and subject to applicable law.",
                "explanation": "This section introduces ambiguity by weakening the mandatory language. Replacing 'shall further inform' with 'will generally inform' makes client notification discretionary. Changing 'requirement to comply' to 'need to be aware of' diminishes the obligation. The phrases 'benefit of considering maintaining records,' 'maybe verify the identity of Cardholders as advisable,' 'think about keeping records,' and 'possibly retain such records for a reasonable time' all introduce significant ambiguity and make the requirements non-mandatory. This contradicts the clear obligations imposed by AML and anti-terrorism laws.",

Details of such shall be provided to AEIS upon request. Schoolpop and Schoolpop's Clients shall not accept cash, coin or currency in exchange for Cards.",

Details of such may be provided to AEIS if convenient. Schoolpop and Schoolpop's Clients will generally avoid accepting cash, coin or currency in exchange for Cards.",
                "explanation": "The modified text significantly weakens the anti-money laundering provisions. Changing 'shall establish and maintain' to 'are encouraged to consider establishing' makes the AML program voluntary. Replacing 'an assigned compliance officer and compliance program' with 'a designated person and related efforts' dilutes the specific requirements. 'Details of such shall be provided to AEIS upon request' becomes 'Details of such may be provided to AEIS if convenient,' making the disclosure optional.

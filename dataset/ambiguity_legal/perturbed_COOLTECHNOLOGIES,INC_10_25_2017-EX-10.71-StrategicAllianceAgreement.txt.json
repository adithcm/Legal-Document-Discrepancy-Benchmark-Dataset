                "original_text": "COOL TECH shall, in a professional manner, take all steps necessary to market and produce its Mobile Generation Program and its other services (collectively the \"COOL TECH Services\") for clients referred to COOL TECH by VET TECH. Any engagement to perform COOL TECH Services shall be on such terms and conditions as COOL TECH may approve at its sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "COOL TECH should endeavor, in what it considers a professional manner, to market its Mobile Generation Program and its other services (collectively the \"COOL TECH Services\") for clients referred by VET TECH. Engagements to perform COOL TECH Services will be subject to terms and conditions as COOL TECH finds acceptable.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation to market and produce services. Adding 'in what it considers a professional manner' introduces a subjective standard. Changing 'approve at its sole discretion' to 'finds acceptable' is similarly ambiguous, potentially allowing COOL TECH to avoid engagements based on arbitrary reasons. This undermines the clear expectation of marketing and service provision.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law (Missouri/Nevada): Ambiguous obligations are difficult to enforce, potentially leading to disputes over performance expectations and good faith dealing, depending on the specific interpretation by a Missouri or Nevada court.",

Any engagement to perform VET TECH Services shall be on such terms and conditions as VET TECH may approve in its sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "VET TECH will attempt, using its own judgment of professional standards, to market and perform its business management consulting, GAIT Software, and other AI services (collectively the \"VET TECH Services\") for referred clients. Engagement terms will be subject to VET TECH's considerations.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'will attempt' reduces the commitment to market and perform services. 'Using its own judgment of professional standards' makes the professional manner subjective and difficult to assess objectively. 'Subject to VET TECH's considerations' is a broad and vague condition, allowing VET TECH to reject engagements without clear justification. This weakens the obligation and introduces room for dispute.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law (Missouri/Nevada): Vague obligation on performance makes it harder to claim a breach, particularly if VET TECH can argue its 'considerations' justified non-performance, which undermines the contract's enforceability under Missouri or Nevada law.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall designate' to 'may consider designating' removes the mandatory requirement for each party to assign a responsible individual. This creates uncertainty about accountability for the agreement's administration, potentially leading to miscommunication and neglected responsibilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law (Missouri/Nevada): By making the designation optional, it undermines the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts, as there is no clear point of contact or responsible party for ensuring the agreement's proper execution, impacting enforceability under Missouri or Nevada law.",

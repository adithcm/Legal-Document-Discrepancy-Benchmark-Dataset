                "original_text": "Antares or its Subcontractor shall properly store the Devices at Antares' or its Subcontractor's storage facility at the Manufacturing Site pursuant to cGMP and Applicable Law.",
                "changed_text": "Antares or its Subcontractor shall endeavor to properly store the Devices at Antares' or its Subcontractor's storage facility at the Manufacturing Site, potentially in accordance with cGMP and Applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear and enforceable legal obligation to store devices properly in accordance with cGMP and applicable law. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'shall' with 'shall endeavor,' introducing uncertainty about whether the storage will meet the required standards. The addition of 'potentially in accordance with' further dilutes the obligation, creating ambiguity about compliance with cGMP and applicable law. This contradicts cGMP requirements for strict and consistent storage procedures.",

Subject to Antares' obligation to cover the costs set forth in Section 5.3(b), AMAG shall be responsible for all costs incurred due to the Recall of a Product, sample Product or Trainer.",
                "changed_text": "AMAG shall generally be responsible for managing Recalls, and Antares will consider cooperating with AMAG upon request. AMAG may be responsible for some costs incurred due to the Recall of a Product, sample Product or Trainer.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that AMAG is responsible for managing all recalls and Antares must cooperate as requested. The changed text replaces 'shall' with 'generally be responsible' and 'will consider cooperating', making AMAG's responsibility and Antares' cooperation discretionary rather than mandatory. Removing 'Subject to Antares' obligation to cover the costs set forth in Section 5.3(b)' and replacing 'shall be responsible for all costs' with 'may be responsible for some costs' makes the allocation of recall costs vague. This introduces ambiguity that could conflict with FDA recall guidelines which expect clear responsibilities.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall obtain and maintain commercial general liability insurance, including product liability insurance covering the obligations of that Party under this Agreement through the Term and for a period of [***] thereafter, which insurance shall afford limits of not less than (i) $[***] for each occurrence; and (ii) $[***] in the aggregate per annum.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should attempt to obtain and maintain commercial general liability insurance, including product liability insurance, potentially covering some obligations under this Agreement during the Term. The insurance may afford some limits.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that each party 'shall obtain and maintain' specific insurance coverage. The modified text weakens this by changing 'shall obtain and maintain' to 'should attempt to obtain and maintain', making the obligation optional. Replacing 'covering the obligations of that Party' with 'potentially covering some obligations' and 'which insurance shall afford limits of not less than' with 'The insurance may afford some limits' introduce significant ambiguity regarding the scope and financial limits of the required insurance. This contradicts standard commercial practice, which requires explicit and adequate insurance coverage.",

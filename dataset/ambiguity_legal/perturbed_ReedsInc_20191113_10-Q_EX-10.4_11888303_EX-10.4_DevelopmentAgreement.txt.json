                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Applicable Laws and Regulations\" shall mean any law, statute, rule, regulation, ordinance or other binding pronouncements of any duly authorized court, tribunal, arbitrator, agency, commission, official or other instrumentality of any federal, state, province, county, city or other political subdivision (domestic or foreign) having the effect of law in the United States, any foreign country or territory or any domestic or foreign state, province, county, city or other political subdivision applicable to the Company or its business.",
                "changed_text": "\"Applicable Laws and Regulations\" shall generally refer to laws and regulations that the Company believes are relevant to its operations.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition to 'generally refer' and adding 'Company believes are relevant' makes the requirement to follow the Applicable Laws and Regulations an opinion rather than a hard set of laws to follow. This creates ambiguity and makes it harder to enforce regulatory obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and state laws, depending on the specific regulation not followed, particularly those requiring strict compliance (e.g., FDA regulations for beverage production).",

                "changed_text": "Company shall endeavor to perform the work in connection with this Agreement in a generally acceptable manner.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'timely, professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards' with 'endeavor to perform in a generally acceptable manner' weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' implies an attempt rather than a guarantee, and 'generally acceptable manner' is subjective and does not provide a clear standard of performance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - The altered text makes it more difficult to prove the company did not meet the required standards, thus creating ambiguity when dealing with what is considered acceptable, and industry standards are not guaranteed to be met.",

                "changed_text": "Company will consider executing and delivering documents that Reed's may request related to Intellectual Property in the Deliverables.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Company *will* execute documents to assist Reed's, where the modified text uses *will consider*, which creates doubt on if the company has to follow what the request is.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law regarding obligations to fulfill agreed-upon terms. The original term has a reasonable clause in case Reed's tries to make extreme requests, where the modified clause opens for refusal.",

                "changed_text": "Smith will endeavor to cooperate with TDA in connection with TDA's exercise of the Rights, subject to Smith's other professional commitments.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to cooperate in good faith' with 'will endeavor to cooperate...subject to Smith's other professional commitments' introduces ambiguity. 'Endeavor' is weaker than 'agree,' and the clause about other commitments provides an easy out for Smith, potentially hindering TDA's rights. This is an ambiguous legal obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles under Arizona law, as it weakens the enforceability of Smith's obligation to cooperate, making it difficult to prove a breach.",

Smith agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by TDA to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved in writing within fourteen (14) days after receipt thereof. Smith agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that TDA will be advised of the specified grounds therefore.",
                "changed_text": "TDA agrees that Smith's Likeness should generally be approved by Smith for advertisements. Smith will aim to approve any material submitted within a reasonable timeframe. Should Smith disapprove any material, TDA will take this into consideration.",
                "explanation": "The original text created a clear obligation for approval. Modifying the text to 'should generally be approved', 'will aim to approve', and 'take this into consideration' introduces ambiguity, making approvals non-mandatory and weakening the legal obligation. This weakens TDA's control over its products and promotion.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles under Arizona Law. Specific performance of promotional activities becomes uncertain due to the vagueness of the language.",

                "original_text": "Smith represents and warrants that, in performing its obligations under this Agreement, Smith does so as an independent contractor and, without limiting the foregoing, Smith assumes exclusive responsibility for the collection and payments of all employer and employee contributions and taxes under all applicable laws now in effect or hereafter enacted and Smith further agrees to file any returns or reports necessary in connection therewith.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'assumes exclusive responsibility' and 'agrees to file' to 'will strive to be responsible' introduces ambiguity regarding Smith's tax obligations. This can be interpreted as not definitively accepting responsibility and weakens the obligation to file returns, potentially leading to tax compliance issues.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal and Arizona state tax laws, which require clear and unambiguous assignment of responsibility for tax payments and filings. This modification creates uncertainty, violating clarity requirements.",

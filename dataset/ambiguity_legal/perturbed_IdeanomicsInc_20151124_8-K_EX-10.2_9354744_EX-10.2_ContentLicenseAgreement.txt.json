                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "If Licensee receives written notice from Licensor that Licensor no longer has the rights to provide a Title to Licensee, Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such Title from Licensee's services.",
                "changed_text": "If Licensee receives written notice from Licensor that Licensor no longer has the rights to provide a Title to Licensee, Licensee may consider removing such Title from Licensee's services.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'may consider' weakens the obligation to remove titles for which rights have expired. This introduces ambiguity, making the action discretionary rather than mandatory, which can lead to copyright infringement if the title is not removed.",

                "original_text": "Licensee will provide Licensor with reports (\"Reports\") containing statistical information collected by Licensee on (i) Users' use of the Titles, (ii) distribution channels used by Licensee for the distribution of the Titles, (iii) sub-licensees to which the Titles were sub-distributed by Licensee and (if permitted under Licensee's agreements with the sublicensees) any relevant reports received by Licensee from those sublicensees, and (iv) any other information that the Licensor may request Licensee to gather from time to time, subject to mutual approval.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will endeavor to provide Licensor with occasional reports (\"Reports\") containing potentially relevant statistical information on Users' use of the Titles. The specific content, frequency, and format of these reports will be at Licensee's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will provide' to 'will endeavor to provide' introduces uncertainty about whether reports will actually be provided. The phrases 'occasional reports', 'potentially relevant statistical information', and 'at Licensee's discretion' make the obligation vague and unenforceable. This change contradicts the original intention for regular and comprehensive reporting, which is crucial for Licensor to monitor the performance and compliance of the Licensee.",

                "changed_text": "Should Licensor, at its sole and undefined discretion, vaguely object to any use of the Licensor Marks by Licensee, Licensor may suggest that Licensee consider modifying its usage, and Licensee will use its own judgment to decide whether to comply.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'at its sole and undefined discretion' and replacing 'shall promptly cease' with 'use its own judgment to decide whether to comply' creates a completely discretionary obligation. The licensor's objection is undefined and the licensee can decide whether to comply or not. This contradicts trademark law where the trademark owner has a right to control the use of their marks to prevent consumer confusion and dilution.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to comply with all applicable laws, rules, treaties, and regulations governing the distribution of the Wireless Products throughout the Territory.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. It suggests that compliance is not mandatory but rather an aspiration. This creates uncertainty regarding the level of effort required from the Licensee to meet legal requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Vague phrasing could conflict with the strict requirements of laws such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and GDPR, which require verifiable and enforceable compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee shall attempt to localize the Wireless Products into the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese, with Portuguese, Greek, Dutch and Swedish to be considered, depending on feasibility and resource availability, to the extent that the Properties are dubbed into such languages.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall localize' with 'shall attempt to localize' and 'to be made available where practicable' with 'to be considered, depending on feasibility and resource availability,' the obligation to localize the Wireless Products becomes vague. The phrase 'depending on feasibility and resource availability' introduces ambiguity, as it's unclear what criteria will be used to determine feasibility or what level of resources must be available.",
                "contradicted_law": "If the failure to localize the Wireless Products into certain languages results in a failure to provide adequate accessibility to a significant portion of the target audience, it may violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires reasonable accommodations to ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities, including those who primarily communicate in languages other than English.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'will generally handle' and 'adequate operation and functionality' with 'operation and functionality...to the extent feasible' weakens the obligation. The phrase 'reasonably consistent with general industry practices' is vague and subjective. It's unclear what constitutes 'general industry practices' or how 'reasonably consistent' is defined. Similarly, 'to the extent feasible' introduces ambiguity, as it's unclear what factors will be considered to determine feasibility.",
                "contradicted_law": "If the lack of compatibility testing results in widespread malfunctions or security vulnerabilities, it could violate California's data security laws (Cal. Civ. Code ยง 1798.81.5), which require businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect personal information.",

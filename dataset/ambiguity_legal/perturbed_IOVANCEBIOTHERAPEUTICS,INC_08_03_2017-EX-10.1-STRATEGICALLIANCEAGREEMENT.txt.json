                "explanation": "The modification replaces the strict obligation \"shall\" with the more lenient \"use reasonable efforts to cause\" and introduces \"in a manner generally consistent with\" for compliance with laws. This weakens the obligation to strictly adhere to all applicable laws and regulations, potentially leading to non-compliance. The ambiguity of \"reasonable efforts\" and \"generally consistent\" allows for subjective interpretation, which can create challenges when regulatory violations are found.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that MD Anderson *shall* register and update clinical studies and *shall* identify LBIO as a financial collaborator. The modified text changes this mandatory obligation to a discretionary one by using terms like 'consider registering,' 'attempt to make updates as deemed appropriate', and 'may identify'. This creates ambiguity and undermines the requirement to publicly disclose information about clinical trials and the financial supporters. This could violate federal laws requiring disclosure of clinical trial information.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"agrees to acknowledge\" to \"will aim to acknowledge\" and \"as scientifically appropriate\" to \"as they see fit\", the agreement makes the obligation to acknowledge LBIO scientists optional and subjective.

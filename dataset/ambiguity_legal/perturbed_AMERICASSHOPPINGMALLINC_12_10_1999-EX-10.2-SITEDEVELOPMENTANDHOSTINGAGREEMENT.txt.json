As used in this Agreement, \"Deerskin Products\" shall not include (i) closeout merchandise which the Company may identify as \"Deerskin\" branded items, if such is the case, nor (ii) products from the Company's Joan Cook Catalog.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 HDI shall endeavor to design, develop, implement, operate, maintain and manage, and enable the Company to establish a presence on the World Wide Web (\"Site\") to make available to Internet users, men's and women's apparel and accessories from the Deerskin Catalog (\"Deerskin Products\"). The inclusion of \"Deerskin\" branded closeout merchandise will be at HDI's discretion. As used in this Agreement, \"Deerskin Products\" shall also exclude products that HDI deems unsuitable for the Site.",
                "explanation": "The term 'endeavor' weakens the obligation to 'shall,' making the design, development, implementation, operation, maintenance and management less mandatory. Allowing HDI discretion over closeout merchandise inclusion and product suitability introduces subjectivity and potential non-compliance with advertising standards, depending on how these decisions are made.",

The Parties hereby covenant and agree that their respective marketing and advertising efforts provided for herein shall at all times comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations and will -7- not contain any material which is obscene, threatening, fraudulent, harassing, libelous, infringing of third party intellectual property rights, otherwise illegal or, in the reasonable judgment of the Party required to display or transmit the advertisement, offensive.",

The Parties hereby covenant that their respective marketing and advertising efforts should generally comply with applicable laws rules and regulations and will try not to contain material that is obviously obscene, threatening, fraudulent, harassing, or libelous. The Parties will aim to respect third-party intellectual property rights to the best of their abilities, and material deemed generally offensive will be avoided where practical.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'should generally comply' significantly weakens the obligation to adhere to all laws and regulations. 'Will try not to contain' introduces uncertainty regarding the commitment to avoid illegal or harmful content. 'Aim to respect' and 'avoided where practical' regarding intellectual property and offensive material make compliance subjective and less enforceable.",

All Confidential Information of the Company shall be held in strict confidence by HDI and shall not be disclosed or used without express written consent of the Company, except as may be required by law.

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be held in strict confidence' to 'should generally be treated as confidential' weakens the confidentiality obligation. Allowing disclosure with 'verbal notification' rather than 'express written consent' diminishes control over confidential information. 'Attempt to use measures' and 'generally employs' reduce the commitment to safeguarding confidential data.",

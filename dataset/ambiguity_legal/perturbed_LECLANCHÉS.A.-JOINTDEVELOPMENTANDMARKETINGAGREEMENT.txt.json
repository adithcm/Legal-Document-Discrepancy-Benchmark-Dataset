                "explanation": "Changing 'shall arrange' to 'shall endeavor to arrange' introduces ambiguity. 'Endeavor' suggests an attempt but does not guarantee the arrangement of insurance, potentially leaving Leclanché exposed.",

The Parties shall take all necessary steps to safeguard the secrecy and confidentiality of all confidential information and all materials and to ensure that such confidential information and material obtained in connection with this Agreement is disclosed only to authorized persons who need to know such information for the purpose of performing their duties on behalf of the company.",

The Parties will take steps, as they deem necessary, to safeguard the confidentiality of such confidential information and materials.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the non-solicitation clause to include qualifiers like 'try not to,' 'actively solicit, encourage to a significant degree,' 'deliberately take actions explicitly intended,' 'substantially interfere in a detrimental way,' and 'crucial employees' introduces significant ambiguity. This weakens the enforceability of the clause, making it difficult to prove a violation. Replacing 'any employee' with 'key employee' excludes other employees from this protection.",

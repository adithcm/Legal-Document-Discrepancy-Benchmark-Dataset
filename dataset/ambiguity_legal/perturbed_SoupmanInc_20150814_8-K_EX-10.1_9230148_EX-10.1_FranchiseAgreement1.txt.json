                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "You shall devote all of your time, attention and best efforts to the Franchised Business pursuant to this Agreement and all work and services performed and/or supervised by you under this Agreement shall be performed and/or supervised by you or by your authorized employees. You shall adhere to all current established policies, practices and procedures of the System, and as the same may be amended from time to time, and shall not deviate therefrom without our prior written consent.",
                "changed_text": "You should aim to devote substantial time and attention to the Franchised Business. All work and services performed and/or supervised by you under this Agreement may be performed and/or supervised by you or your employees. It is preferable to adhere to established policies, practices, and procedures of the System, and deviation therefrom is subject to discussion with us.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguities by replacing 'shall' with 'should aim,' 'shall be performed' with 'may be performed,' and 'shall adhere' with 'it is preferable to adhere.' This weakens the obligations, allowing for subjective interpretation and potential non-compliance. Some franchise laws require franchisees to dedicate their full efforts and strictly adhere to system standards, which this change contradicts.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of franchise law requiring franchisees to devote adequate efforts and comply with system standards to maintain brand consistency and protect intellectual property, and more specific regulations relating to these duties in states such as California and New York.",

                "changed_text": "You, as an independent business owner, will use reasonable efforts to obtain necessary permits, certificates, or licenses for the operation of the Franchised Business, including licenses to do business and sales tax permits.",
                "explanation": "The term 'timely obtain' is replaced with 'use reasonable efforts,' which is ambiguous and does not guarantee compliance. 'Any and all' is replaced with 'necessary' which is a subjective term. This change introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation to secure all required permits, potentially conflicting with state and local laws requiring strict compliance and timely acquisition of all operational permits, such as health permits, business licenses, and occupancy permits.",
                "contradicted_law": "State and local laws mandating strict compliance with permit and licensing requirements for operating a business, varying by state and municipality but generally including business licenses, health permits, and occupancy permits, such as New York State regulations.",

To protect the Proprietary Marks and our goodwill in the industry, you must submit samples of all proposed Solicitation Advertising materials to us at least fifteen (15) days before any use of the same.",

You could consider spending up to $5,000 each month on Solicitation Advertising. To generally protect the Proprietary Marks and our goodwill, submitting samples of advertising materials is appreciated.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to advertise by changing 'shall' to 'may' and 'shall expend not less than' to 'could consider spending up to'. Removing the strict monthly spending requirement introduces uncertainty. The term 'must submit' is replaced with 'submitting samples...is appreciated,' making the approval process non-mandatory. This weakens control over brand representation, potentially contravening regulations requiring franchisors to maintain adequate control over franchisees' marketing to protect the brand and prevent misleading advertising, as enforced by the FTC.",
                "contradicted_law": "FTC regulations regarding franchisor control over franchisee advertising and marketing, state franchise laws requiring franchisors to protect their brand, and general advertising laws requiring truthful and non-misleading advertising, such as those in New York and California.",

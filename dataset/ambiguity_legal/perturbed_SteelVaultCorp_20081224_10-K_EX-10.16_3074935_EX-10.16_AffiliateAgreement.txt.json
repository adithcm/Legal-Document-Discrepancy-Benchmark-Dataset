                "original_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall be responsible for collecting all amounts due directly from the Consumer and  shall bear sole responsibility for non-payment of any fees charged to the Consumer. Marketing Affiliate shall pay to  Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in  Exhibit A attached hereto. Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in  full by Marketing Affiliate 30 days from the invoice date. The prices set forth in Exhibit A do not include regulatory  fees, sales tax, excise tax or any other fees or taxes that may be charged by states or local taxing authorities nor does it  include additional fees or surcharges, including specific area Affiliate charges that may be accessed by the Credit  Reporting Agencies (CRA's). Said amounts charged to Equidata will be billed separately to Marketing Affiliate and are  due immediately upon receipt. Marketing Affiliate agrees to reimburse Equidata all costs of collecting any past due  amounts from Marketing Affiliate by reason of non payment, including reasonable attorney fees and disbursements.",
                "changed_text": "Marketing Affiliate will endeavor to collect amounts due from the Consumer and will make reasonable efforts regarding non-payment of fees. Marketing Affiliate will remit to Equidata amounts as outlined in Exhibit A. Amounts will be billed periodically and should be paid within a reasonable timeframe. The prices in Exhibit A may not include all regulatory fees or taxes, and additional fees may be billed separately. Marketing Affiliate will consider reimbursing Equidata's collection costs.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing definitive terms like 'shall be responsible' and 'shall pay' with vague terms like 'will endeavor,' 'reasonable efforts,' and 'will remit.' The precise payment terms are obscured by replacing '30 days from the invoice date' with 'reasonable timeframe,' and the obligation to reimburse collection costs is weakened by 'will consider.'",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - Uncertainty in payment obligations renders the contract unenforceable, and potentially violates Virginia's laws regarding contract certainty.",

                "original_text": "In the case of disputed charge, defined as a non-payment of an invoice for which notice of dispute has been  given in writing by Marketing Affiliate to Equidata, Equidata or Marketing Affiliate may choose arbitration and  Marketing Affiliate and Equidata shall be obligated by the terms agreed upon by arbitration and all monies determined  owed shall be considered due and payable immediately. Such arbitration does not relieve Marketing Affiliate from its  obligation to promptly pay for undisputed charges in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such disputes shall  be settled by arbitration in the City of Newport News, Virginia.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a disputed charge, where Marketing Affiliate has notified Equidata, arbitration may be considered. If pursued, parties should attempt to adhere to terms resulting from arbitration, and any monies deemed owed may be requested promptly. Arbitration does not necessarily alleviate Marketing Affiliate's responsibility to pay undisputed charges. Disputes may be addressed through arbitration in Newport News, Virginia.",
                "explanation": "This revision uses weaker language. 'May be considered' instead of 'may choose.' 'Should attempt to adhere' in place of 'shall be obligated,' and replacing 'shall be considered due and payable immediately' with 'may be requested promptly.' This introduces uncertainty about the arbitration process and payment obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Virginia Uniform Arbitration Act - By making the adherence to arbitration terms and payment of monies 'discretionary,' the revised text undermines the binding nature of arbitration awards.",

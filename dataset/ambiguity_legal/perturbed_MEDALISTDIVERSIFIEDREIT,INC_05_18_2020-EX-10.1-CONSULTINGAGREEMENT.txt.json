                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall consult with REIT and provide the services outlined in the attached Statement of Work in a timely and professional manner in accordance with industry standards.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall endeavor to consult with REIT and provide services generally aligned with the attached Statement of Work.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall consult' with 'shall endeavor to consult' and 'services outlined' with 'services generally aligned' introduces ambiguity, weakening the consultant's obligation to provide specific services in a timely manner and according to industry standards. This makes the contractual obligation less enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clarity and definiteness in contractual obligations, potentially leading to a breach of contract claim due to vagueness.",
                "location": "Section 1"

                "changed_text": "The determination of the completeness of work product will generally be at the discretion of REIT, and CONSULTANT will consider revisions, additions, deletions or alterations suggested by the Company.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Completeness of work product shall be determined by REIT in its sole discretion' to 'will generally be at the discretion of REIT' introduces uncertainty about the REIT's authority to determine completeness. Furthermore, replacing 'agrees to make all revisions' with 'will consider revisions' weakens the consultant's obligation to make necessary changes, creating ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not: (a) solicit, entice or induce any Customer for the purpose of providing, or provide, products or services that are competitive with the products or services provided by the Company, or (b) solicit, entice, or induce any Customer to terminate or reduce its business with (or refrain from increasing its business with) the Company.",
                "changed_text": "CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of approximately twelve (12) months after the termination, it will use commercially reasonable efforts not to solicit customers for similar competitive services to the extent that such services directly compete with those offered by the Company.",
                "explanation": "This modification uses vague terms such as 'approximately twelve (12) months,' 'commercially reasonable efforts,' 'similar competitive services,' and 'directly compete.' These ambiguous terms weaken the non-solicitation clause, making it difficult to enforce and potentially conflicting with reasonable restrictions on competition permitted under Virginia law. The original clause established a clear prohibition, whereas the modified clause introduces subjective standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Virginia law regarding the enforceability of non-solicitation agreements, which requires them to be reasonable and narrowly tailored to protect legitimate business interests. The ambiguity introduced makes it harder to determine if the restriction is reasonable.",

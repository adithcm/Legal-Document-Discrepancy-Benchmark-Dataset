                "explanation": "The original text clearly states IBM 'will perform' services with reasonable care and 'will provide' competent personnel. The modified text uses vague terms like 'endeavor to perform,' 'what it considers to be reasonable care,' 'generally in accordance,' and 'aim to provide' personnel that it 'believes are competent.' This weakens the obligation and introduces subjective criteria.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Duty of Care and Performance Standards. This weakens IBM's duty of care and creates ambiguity around performance standards, making it harder to prove breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the customer 'will pay'. The change replaces this with 'will attempt to pay', making the payment of taxes non-obligatory. Additionally, the original terms states that charges are exclusive of fees, whereas the changed text makes it 'may be', which is ambiguous.",

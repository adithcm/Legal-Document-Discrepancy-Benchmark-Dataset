                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "plan_b shall provide LICENSOR with a detailed written record, which includes the number of End User downloads and each distribution channel. Such report shall be provided to LICENSOR in electronic format within 6 weeks of the end of a quarter.",
                "changed_text": "plan_b shall endeavor to provide LICENSOR with a written record detailing End User downloads and distribution channels. The provision of such reports in electronic format will be subject to plan_b's internal reporting capabilities and may be provided periodically.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'plan_b' to provide detailed reports within a specific timeframe. The modified version introduces ambiguity with 'endeavor to provide', making the reporting obligation less stringent. Specifying that electronic provision is subject to 'plan_b's internal reporting capabilities' makes it discretionary, and changing 'within 6 weeks of the end of a quarter' to 'periodically' removes a clear deadline, making enforcement difficult.",

LICENSOR indemnifies and holds harmless plan_b against all claims that Content infringes any of the above mentioned rights of a third Party. LICENSOR shall pay all damages awarded in a trial to a third Party.",
                "changed_text": "LICENSOR will use reasonable efforts to ensure Content does not infringe an intellectual property right. LICENSOR may indemnify plan_b against some claims, depending on the specifics, where Content infringes a third partyâ€™s rights. LICENSOR will consider contributing to damages awarded in a trial.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a strict warranty against intellectual property infringement and a clear indemnification obligation. The modified version weakens this by stating LICENSOR will use 'reasonable efforts' instead of guaranteeing non-infringement, making the indemnity discretionary ('may indemnify...depending on the specifics'), and only 'considering' contribution to damages. This ambiguity limits LICENSOR's liability and makes it difficult to enforce the original intent.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party will endeavor to maintain the confidentiality of materials and information received from the other Party when practical, especially when explicitly marked confidential, and will use commercially reasonable judgment in using such material for purposes outside of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces a strict confidentiality obligation. The modification weakens this by adding the qualifiers 'endeavor to maintain', 'when practical' and 'commercially reasonable judgment'. The term \"commercially reasonable judgement\" is undefined and vague. This language transforms a strict obligation into a discretionary one, making it difficult to enforce and creating ambiguity as to the level of confidentiality required.",

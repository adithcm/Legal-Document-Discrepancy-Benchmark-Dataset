                "explanation": "By stating that Capitalized terms may be interpreted at the Supplier's discretion introduces ambiguity. Contract law requires clear and consistent definitions to avoid disputes. Allowing the supplier to interpret defined terms as they see fit undermines the agreement's enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'to set forth the terms and conditions' to 'to generally describe' weakens the definiteness of the agreement. Replacing 'desire to add' with 'may consider adding' introduces uncertainty about whether the offer placement system software is actually part of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By stating that sufficiency is subject to further review and the intention to collaborate weakens the binding nature of the agreement.

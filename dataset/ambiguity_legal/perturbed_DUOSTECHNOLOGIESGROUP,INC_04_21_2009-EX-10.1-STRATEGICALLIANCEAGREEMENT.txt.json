                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall comply with all prevailing laws, rules and regulations and obtain all necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the jurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall endeavor to comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and will seek approvals, consents, and permits as deemed reasonably necessary by their internal counsel for its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply,' which does not guarantee full compliance. Adding 'as deemed reasonably necessary by their internal counsel' introduces subjectivity and allows the parties to decide which approvals are needed, potentially conflicting with mandatory requirements. This contradicts the intent of regulations which demands strict adherence to laws and rules, not just attempts to comply.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various U.S. federal and state laws requiring strict compliance, such as environmental regulations or labor laws. For Florida, this could violate specific Florida Statutes requiring permits for particular business operations.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties will attempt to act in what they perceive as good faith, generally consistent with their understanding of their rights and obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the parties must act in good faith. The modified text adds subjective components such as 'what they perceive' and 'generally consistent,' creating ambiguity and allowing each party to interpret 'good faith' based on their understanding. This could lead to disputes over whether a party truly acted in good faith and undermines the concept of good faith as a defined legal standard. This weakens the enforceability of the good faith obligation, potentially violating established principles of contract law where good faith is often expected.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law and potentially the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) which requires good faith in the performance and enforcement of contracts.",

                "original_text": "Rubicon shall indemnify and hold harmless ISA and its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, judgments, awards, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and disbursements, including without limitation, the costs, expenses and disbursements, as and when incurred, of preparing or defending any action, suit, proceeding or investigation asserted by a third party (\"Losses\"), caused by, based upon, arising out of or in connection with a claim by a third party that the Rubicon Offerings infringe a 3rd party's exiting intellectual property rights or due to the gross negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct on the part of Rubicon or its affiliates or its officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants or users.",
                "changed_text": "Rubicon will consider indemnifying ISA and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, judgments, awards, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees) and disbursements related to a third-party claim asserting that the Rubicon Offerings infringe a 3rd party's intellectual property rights or due to the alleged gross negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct of Rubicon, its affiliates, or related parties, subject to Rubicon's internal review and approval.",
                "explanation": "This alteration replaces a direct indemnification obligation with a discretionary assessment, significantly weakening the protection afforded to ISA. Phrases such as 'will consider indemnifying' and 'subject to Rubicon's internal review and approval' introduce ambiguity and allow Rubicon to avoid its responsibility at its discretion. By making the indemnification conditional upon Rubicon's approval, it undermines the legal commitment and makes it difficult for ISA to enforce the clause. The original language provides clear protection, whereas the modified language introduces uncertainty and potentially allows Rubicon to evade its indemnity responsibilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles; this weakens the enforceability of the indemnification clause which is a standard provision in contracts. It may run afoul of common law principles requiring clear and unambiguous language in contracts. It also undermines the reasonable expectations of the parties as to the allocation of risk.",

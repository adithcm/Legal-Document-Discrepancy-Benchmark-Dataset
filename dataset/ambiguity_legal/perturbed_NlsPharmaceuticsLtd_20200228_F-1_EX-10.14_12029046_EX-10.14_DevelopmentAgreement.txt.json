                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Eurofarma shall use reasonable commercial efforts to comply with the sales set out in the Preliminary Business Plan, and the Business Plan may be updated annually by Eurofarma based on updates on the clinical development timelines, market and economic changes and results from clinical trials, which shall be mutually accepted and agreed between the Parties. Except for critical changes in the assumptions considered in the Preliminary Business Plan, the sales shall not vary substantially.",
                "changed_text": "Eurofarma should consider making commercially reasonable efforts to generally align with the sales projections in the Preliminary Business Plan. The Business Plan may be updated at Eurofarma's discretion, considering possible changes in clinical development, market conditions, and trial outcomes, and NLS will be updated on these changes. Substantial variation in sales figures may occur.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces 'shall use' with 'should consider,' making the obligation to comply with sales projections less definitive and creating ambiguity. The phrase 'generally align' is vague and subjective. Moreover, stating that 'substantial variation in sales figures may occur' further weakens the commitment to the original sales targets.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles in Brazil, specifically regarding the enforceability of contractual obligations. Brazilian law requires clarity and precision in contractual obligations; this weakened language may render the sales targets unenforceable, contradicting the intent of a business plan as a reasonably certain predictor of commercial activity.",

                "original_text": "Licensor shall take all reasonable actions and render all reasonable assistance to help Licensee obtain and maintain the MA which are reasonably requested by the Licensee or required by the competent authorities in line with local requirements and/or necessary to avoid the imposition of any restriction or condition under the MA by the competent authorities.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor should endeavor to provide assistance, as it deems appropriate, to help Licensee obtain and maintain the MA, if reasonably convenient, based on Licensee requests or local authority requirements. The Licensor is only required to act if such action avoids significant restrictions under the MA by the competent authorities.",
                "explanation": "This alteration shifts the obligation from 'shall take all reasonable actions' to 'should endeavor to provide assistance, as it deems appropriate,' making the Licensor's assistance discretionary. 'If reasonably convenient' adds another layer of ambiguity. Furthermore, limiting the obligation to avoiding 'significant restrictions' instead of 'any' restriction changes the scope and enforceability of the original requirement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Brazilian regulatory law concerning pharmaceutical licensing, which requires clear and unambiguous responsibilities for obtaining and maintaining Marketing Authorizations. This change introduces uncertainty about the Licensor's support, potentially hindering Eurofarma's ability to meet Brazilian regulatory standards.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties may, at a mutually convenient time, explore the potential for a separate manufacturing and supply agreement concerning the Licensed Product, with tech-transfer considered subject to feasibility during the Agreementâ€™s term.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a likely future agreement, whereas the modified text makes it optional with phrases like 'may', 'at a mutually convenient time', and 'potential for'. The tech-transfer is no longer an expected part of the agreement, being 'considered subject to feasibility'. This makes the future agreement and tech transfer highly uncertain.",
                "contradicted_law": "Principles of contract law under the Netherlands jurisdiction, as stated in section 21, specifically regarding good faith negotiation and the expectation of fulfilling implied agreements. By weakening the commitment to enter into a manufacturing and supply agreement, especially concerning tech-transfer, the modified language could violate the duty to negotiate in good faith as generally expected under Netherlands law.",

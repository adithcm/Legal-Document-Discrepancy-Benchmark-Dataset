                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to ensure that the Business complies with applicable Laws in respect of operation, advertising and promotion of the Business and use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content in connection therewith.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Licensee to 'ensure compliance', whereas the modified text suggests that Licensee will only 'endeavor to ensure compliance'. This introduces ambiguity about the level of responsibility and effort required by the Licensee, making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. It is unclear if the licensee must take all actions necessary to comply, or simply take reasonable steps.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee's failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall attempt to remove offending Content, including potentially illegal materials, possibly pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites when feasible after it possibly becomes aware of such offending Content, within a reasonable timeframe after receipt of potential oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee's general failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) may be deemed a breach of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall remove' to 'shall attempt to remove', 'any' to 'potentially', 'as soon as possible' to 'when feasible', 'becomes aware' to 'possibly becomes aware', 'timeframe prescribed' to 'reasonable timeframe', and 'material breach' to 'may be deemed a breach'. These changes weaken the obligation to remove prohibited content, making it unclear what constitutes sufficient action. The language is vague and open to interpretation, potentially resulting in slow or incomplete removal of offending content.",

                "changed_text": "Licensor should generally make available to Licensee the Licensed Content in a similar manner and with reasonably comparable speed and efficiency as such Licensed Content was made available to SINA Leju prior to the Effective Date, perhaps through Licensor's content database, but ideally with comparable speed, efficiency, or level of access than Licensor provides with respect to its own operations.",
                "explanation": "The language is made ambiguous by replacing shall make with should generally make, substantially the same with similar, and substantially the same speed and efficiency with reasonably comparable speed and efficiency. Also, namely through Licensor's content database is changed with perhaps through Licensor's content database, but in no event with less speed, efficiency, or a lesser level of access than Licensor provides with respect to its own operations with ideally with comparable speed, efficiency, or level of access than Licensor provides with respect to its own operations.

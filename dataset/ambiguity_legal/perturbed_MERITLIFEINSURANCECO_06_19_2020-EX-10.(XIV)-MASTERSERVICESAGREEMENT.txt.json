                "changed_text": "Contractor shall endeavor to provide qualified personnel to perform the Services in a manner it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The term 'endeavor to provide' weakens the obligation to provide qualified personnel. The phrase 'in a manner it deems appropriate' replaces the objective standard of 'professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with industry standards' with a subjective standard, creating ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall cause...to comply with' with 'will encourage...to be mindful of' weakens the obligation for compliance with company rules. Additionally, replacing 'has provided' with 'attempts to communicate' creates ambiguity as to whether the company is legally required to provide these rules.",

                "changed_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Contractor should consider maintaining workers compensation insurance, comprehensive general liability insurance, and professional errors and omissions insurance with what it considers to be adequate coverage, in connection with the provision of Services by Contractor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall maintain' to 'should consider maintaining' makes the insurance requirement discretionary. Removing the specific coverage amounts and replacing them with 'what it considers to be adequate coverage' introduces subjective judgment, leading to potential under-insurance. This is relevant as Arizona law requires workers' compensation insurance for most employers.",

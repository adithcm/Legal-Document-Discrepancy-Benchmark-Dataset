                "original_text": "Affiliate shall actively promote the Service consistent with its business judgment, including the broadcast by each Station transmitting the Service of an average of at least ten (10) thirty (30)-second promotional announcements per week for the Service (\"Promotional Spots\") on the Station's Primary Feed, including the Station's analog signal for so long as the Station broadcasts an analog signal, on a run-of- station basis, commencing no later than the first air date of the Service on the applicable Station. Affiliate will submit program listings for the Service to local print and on-screen guides. Additionally, Affiliate will provide a link to Network's website (i.e., URL www.thetubetv.com or any replacement or supplemental URL) on the websites of each of the Stations.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate should consider promoting the Service at its discretion, perhaps including some promotional announcements for the Service (“Promotional Spots”) on the Station's Primary Feed. Affiliate may submit program listings for the Service to local print and on-screen guides, if convenient. Affiliate might provide a link to Network's website on the websites of each of the Stations.",
                "explanation": "The modified language weakens the obligation to promote the Service. Replacing 'shall actively promote' with 'should consider promoting at its discretion' makes promotion optional. Similarly, changing 'Affiliate will submit' to 'Affiliate may submit, if convenient' and 'Affiliate will provide' to 'Affiliate might provide' reduces mandatory actions to suggestions. This introduces ambiguity as to the level of promotional effort required.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in all contracts under New York law, as it undermines the reasonable expectation that the affiliate would actively promote the service they are contracted to broadcast.",

                "original_text": "Network agrees to disclose to Affiliate, in writing, the existence, source and nature of any payments or other consideration received in connection with the production of the Service. Such disclosure shall be made prior to the time such matter is broadcast, so that each Station can satisfy its disclosure obligations under federal law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, proper disclosure in the content of the Service will satisfy Network's disclosure obligations to Affiliate under this Section 13(m), provided Network agrees to provide full details to Affiliate immediately upon request.",
                "changed_text": "Network will endeavor to disclose to Affiliate the existence, source, and nature of any payments or other consideration received for including material in the Service, as appropriate. Disclosure will ideally occur before broadcast, to help Stations with their federal obligations. Disclosure in the content of the Service could satisfy Network’s obligations, and Network will attempt to provide details to Affiliate upon request.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Network agrees to disclose' to 'Network will endeavor to disclose, as appropriate' introduces ambiguity, making the disclosure discretionary. Further, weakening the requirement for pre-broadcast disclosure with 'Disclosure will ideally occur before broadcast' creates uncertainty. Replacing 'Network agrees to provide full details immediately upon request' with 'Network will attempt to provide details to Affiliate upon request' makes providing details optional. This undermines Affiliate's ability to ensure compliance with federal law.",
                "contradicted_law": "This modification could hinder compliance with 47 U.S. Code § 317 regarding disclosure of payments for broadcast material, as the discretionary nature of the disclosure and the timing might not allow the stations to properly inform their audiences.",

Network also shall display and encode program ratings for the Service using the industry-standard \"V-chip\" ratings system.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Network shall provide full-time closed captioning' to 'Network will aim to provide closed captioning when practical and where legally advisable' introduces ambiguity and reduces the obligation for closed captioning. Replacing 'Network also shall display and encode program ratings' with 'Network may also consider displaying program ratings' makes implementing V-chip ratings discretionary. This affects access for people with hearing disabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "This directly contradicts the requirements of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (CVAA), which mandates closed captioning for video programming distributed on television and the Internet. The vague wording of 'when practical and where legally advisable' provides a loophole that could excuse non-compliance with CVAA regulations.",

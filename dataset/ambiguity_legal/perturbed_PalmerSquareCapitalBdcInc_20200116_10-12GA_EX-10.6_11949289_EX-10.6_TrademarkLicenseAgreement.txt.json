                "original_text": "In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of the Licensee's business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of Licensee's business as of the Effective Date. The Licensee further agrees to use the Licensed Mark in accordance with such quality standards as may be reasonably established by Licensor and communicated to the Licensee from time to time in writing, or as may be agreed to by Licensor and the Licensee from time to time in writing.",
                "changed_text": "In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, Licensee will endeavor to maintain the quality of the Licensee's business and the operation thereof, aiming for standards similar to those prevailing as of the Effective Date. The Licensee may consider using the Licensed Mark in accordance with quality standards that the Licensor communicates or agrees upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates 'reasonable efforts' to maintain quality equal to existing standards, while the modified version weakens this by stating the licensee 'will endeavor' to maintain the quality, ‘aiming for similar standards.’ Additionally, 'may consider using' makes compliance with the licensor's quality standards optional rather than obligatory, undermining the control the licensor has over its brand reputation. This ambiguity could allow the Licensee to operate at a quality level that is below the Licensor's expectations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lanham Act, Section 45 (15 U.S.C. § 1127) - Trademark Act of 1946, which requires trademark licensors to maintain control over the quality of goods or services sold under the licensed mark to avoid abandonment of the trademark.",

                "original_text": "Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business and shall notify Licensor of any action that must be taken by Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee acknowledges that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark should generally align with laws, rules, regulations, and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be relevant to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business, and will inform Licensor if the Licensee deems an action is needed to better align with such laws, rules, regulations, or requirements.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'should generally align with' weakens the obligation to strictly comply with all applicable laws. Removing the mandate to notify the licensor of 'any action that must be taken' and replacing it with informing the licensor 'if the Licensee deems an action is needed' introduces Licensee's discretion. This undermines the Licensor's ability to ensure the Licensee is complying with applicable laws and regulations, especially those related to marketing and advertising.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce. The modifications introduce ambiguity regarding the licensee's obligation to comply with advertising and marketing regulations, increasing the risk of violating the FTC Act.",

                "original_text": "For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "changed_text": "For approximately twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee will consider specifying on certain public-facing materials that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as Licensor may suggest.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the licensee to specify on all public-facing materials that they are no longer associated with the licensor post-termination. The modification makes this obligation much weaker by changing 'shall specify' to 'will consider specifying' and 'prominent place and in prominent typeface' is removed, thereby making the action optional and less conspicuous. The use of 'approximately' introduces ambiguity regarding the duration, and replaces 'as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion' with 'as Licensor may suggest' which undermines the licensor's control over the message and its ability to mitigate potential brand confusion.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lanham Act, Section 32 (15 U.S.C. § 1114) - Infringement. This change weakens the requirement to prevent consumer confusion, potentially increasing the risk of trademark infringement after the agreement terminates, as consumers might mistakenly associate the licensee with the licensor even after the license has ended.",

                "original_text": "Consultant shall not, during or subsequent to the term of this Agreement, use any Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than the performance of the Services on behalf of Company, or disclose Confidential Information to any third party. Consultant agrees that Confidential Information shall remain the sole property of Company. Consultant further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant shall endeavor, during or subsequent to the term of this Agreement, to avoid using Confidential Information for purposes other than the performance of Services on behalf of Company, and will try not to disclose Confidential Information to any third party. Consultant acknowledges that Confidential Information is considered the property of Company. Consultant agrees to take precautions, as deemed necessary, to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguity by replacing 'shall not' with 'shall endeavor,' 'agrees that' with 'acknowledges that' and 'all reasonable precautions' with 'precautions, as deemed necessary.' This makes the obligation to protect confidential information weaker and more subjective. Using 'try not to' is also ambiguous.",

                "changed_text": "Consultant agrees to consider signing, executing and acknowledging documents and performing such acts as may seem appropriate for the purposes of possibly assisting in perfecting the assignments and potentially obtaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'agrees to sign' with 'agrees to consider signing,' 'may be necessary, useful or convenient' with 'may seem appropriate', 'perfecting the foregoing assignments and obtaining, enforcing and defending' to 'possibly assisting in perfecting the assignments and potentially obtaining, enforcing and defending', weakening Consultant's obligation to assist in securing intellectual property rights. There is no requirement to enforce those patents.",

                "original_text": "Consultant represents and warrants that Consultant has not been debarred under Section (a) or (b) of 21 U.S.C. Section 335a and does not appear on the United States Food and Drug debarment list. Consultant represents and warrants that Consultant has not committed any crime or conduct that could result in such debarment or Consultant's exclusion from any governmental healthcare program. Consultant represents and warrants that, to Consultant's knowledge, no investigations, claims or proceedings with respect to any such crimes or conduct are pending or threatened against Consultant. Consultant agrees and undertakes to promptly notify the Company if Consultant becomes debarred or proceedings have been initiated against Consultant with respect to debarment, whether such debarment or initiation of proceedings occurs during or after the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant believes they are not currently debarred under Section (a) or (b) of 21 U.S.C. Section 335a and likely do not appear on the United States Food and Drug debarment list. Consultant understands that they have not knowingly committed any crime or conduct that could result in such debarment or Consultant's exclusion from any governmental healthcare program. Consultant states that, to the best of their recollection, no investigations, claims or proceedings with respect to any such crimes or conduct are pending or threatened against Consultant. Consultant will use reasonable efforts to notify the Company if Consultant becomes debarred or proceedings have been initiated against Consultant with respect to debarment, but cannot guarantee prompt notification.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces 'represents and warrants' with weaker language like 'believes,' 'likely,' 'understands,' and 'to the best of their recollection,' significantly reducing the Consultant's guarantee of compliance with debarment regulations. Replacing 'agrees and undertakes to promptly notify' with 'will use reasonable efforts to notify...but cannot guarantee prompt notification' further weakens the obligation. There's no clear requirement to be upfront about potentially being debarred.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 U.S.C. Section 335a (regarding debarment) and related regulations requiring strict compliance and reporting to ensure integrity in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. Because Kiromic deals in Healthcare, this would be vital.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Terminal Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to provide and maintain or cause to be provided and maintained in working order for the duration of this Agreement, the necessary transit facilities within their respective Countries as may be reasonably required for extending capacity in the APCN 2 so as to provide connections to the other international cables' transmission facilities.",
                "changed_text": "The Terminal Parties should endeavor to provide transit facilities within their respective countries as they deem reasonably necessary for extending capacity in the APCN 2 to connect with other international cables' transmission facilities.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Terminal Parties 'shall use all reasonable efforts,' implying a strong obligation to provide and maintain transit facilities. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'should endeavor,' suggesting a non-mandatory effort, and by adding 'as they deem reasonably necessary,' making the provision of facilities subjective and discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "Telecommunications laws in many countries, including the United States (47 U.S. Code ยง 201 - Common carriers; reasonable charges; unjust or unreasonable discrimination), require telecommunications providers to offer interconnection and transit facilities on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The ambiguous language introduces a risk of discriminatory practices and violates these regulatory expectations.",

                "original_text": "In the performance of their obligations hereunder, the Parties agree to comply with all applicable laws of all Countries having jurisdiction over the activities performed under or stipulated by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the performance of their obligations hereunder, the Parties will generally try to comply with what they believe to be the applicable laws of Countries with jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "The original clause imposes a strict requirement for all parties to comply with applicable laws. The modified clause changes 'agree to comply' to 'will generally try to comply,' weakening the obligation. The addition of 'what they believe to be' makes compliance subjective and dependent on the party's interpretation of the law, and could also be difficult to prove in court. This change creates ambiguity around the level of compliance required and could lead to legal disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by jurisdiction, but generally, most countries have laws that require strict adherence to regulations, especially in international commerce. This could be a violation of anti-corruption laws (like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the US), trade regulations, or other international legal frameworks.",

                "original_text": "The Terminal Parties agree to confer the right of Direct Access at the Network Interface to each Party and all other Carriers that have received the Right of Use pursuant to Paragraph 12. The connection to the Network Interface at specific Terminal Stations shall be provided at a reasonable cost in accordance with the physical, engineering and any locally applicable arrangements between the Carriers accessing the Network Interface and the respective Terminal Parties at the Terminal Station.",
                "changed_text": "The Terminal Parties may consider offering Direct Access at the Network Interface to Parties and other Carriers as they find feasible. Connection costs should generally be reasonable based on existing arrangements.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Terminal Parties 'agree to confer the right of Direct Access,' establishing a clear obligation. The modification introduces significant ambiguity by changing this to 'may consider offering Direct Access,' making the provision of Direct Access discretionary. Further, replacing 'shall be provided at a reasonable cost' with 'should generally be reasonable' weakens the cost obligation and introduces subjective interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Telecommunications regulations in many jurisdictions (including the United States under the Telecommunications Act of 1996) mandate that incumbent carriers provide interconnection to other carriers on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The modified language introduces ambiguity, creating a loophole that could allow Terminal Parties to deny or obstruct Direct Access, potentially violating these regulations.",

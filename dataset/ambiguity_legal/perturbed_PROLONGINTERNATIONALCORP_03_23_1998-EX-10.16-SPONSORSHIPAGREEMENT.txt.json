                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Sabco shall provide at its expense a staff member to handle race team's media and public relations needs and shall cause Prolong to receive prominent mention and display within press kits featuring the Sabco No. 40, 42 and 46 race cars.",
                "changed_text": "Sabco will endeavor to provide a staff member to assist with the race team's media and public relations, and may include Prolong's mention in press kits.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall provide' to 'will endeavor to provide' weakens the obligation. Additionally, changing 'shall cause Prolong to receive prominent mention' to 'may include Prolong's mention' makes the prominent mention discretionary, creating ambiguity. This could be interpreted as not guaranteeing any specific level of exposure.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - Creates an unenforceable term due to vagueness, impacting the expected benefit to Prolong.",

                "original_text": "Sabco shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Prolong, its officers, directors, employees and representatives from and against any and all losses, claims, suits, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including attorney fees and count costs incurred by any of them arising out of: (i) Any breach of any warrant made by Sabco herein; (ii) Any acts done or words spoken (iii) Any claims by any persons arising from acts or omissions of any nature by Sabco, its employees or agents, including but not limited to, claims arising during the court of competition or practice in the performance of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Sabco will consider indemnifying Prolong, its officers, directors, employees and representatives from losses, claims, suits, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, potentially including attorney fees and court costs, if it is determined that the loss arose directly from Sabco's gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless' to 'will consider indemnifying' makes the indemnification discretionary. Adding the 'gross negligence' requirement significantly raises the bar for liability, making it ambiguous and difficult for Prolong to enforce in case of any damages. It allows Sabco to argue that any damage was not due to gross negligence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law - Undermines the enforceability of the indemnification clause, making it less protective for Prolong and potentially unenforceable.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The parties further agree to cooperate with each other in any manner reasonably requested by the other party to effectuate the purposes and provisions of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The parties will consider cooperating with each other as appropriate, based on internal resource availability, to support the general intent of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree to cooperate' with 'will consider cooperating' introduces discretion and weakens the obligation. Adding 'based on internal resource availability' and 'general intent' provides loopholes, making it difficult to enforce specific cooperation requests. The definition of 'general intent' is also unclear and subjective.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Renders the cooperation clause unenforceable due to its vagueness and subjective criteria.",

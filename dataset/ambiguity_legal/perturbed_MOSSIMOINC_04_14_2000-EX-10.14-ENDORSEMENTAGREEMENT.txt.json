                "original_text": "Company shall provide and maintain, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance and advertising injury coverage, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), and shall cause such policy to be endorsed to state that Duval is an additional named insured thereunder. A certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage shall be furnished to Duval within thirty (30) days of the full execution of this Agreement. Such insurance policy shall provide that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such policy or remove Duval as an additional named insured without prior written notice to Duval at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall endeavor to provide commercial general liability insurance and advertising injury coverage, with coverage amounts that are believed to be reasonably sufficient. A certificate of insurance may be furnished to Duval when practical. The insurance policy should attempt to provide that the insurer will try to notify Duval before terminating or materially modifying such policy.",
                "explanation": "The modifications weaken the obligation to maintain specific insurance coverage and provide notice of changes. Replacing 'shall provide and maintain' with 'shall endeavor to provide' makes the insurance requirement discretionary. Changing 'with limits of not less than One Million Dollars' to 'with coverage amounts that are believed to be reasonably sufficient' introduces subjectivity and ambiguity. Replacing 'shall be furnished' with 'may be furnished when practical' and 'shall provide' with 'should attempt to provide' further reduces the enforceability of the insurance requirements and notification obligations. These changes create significant ambiguity about whether Duval is truly protected. This weakens Mossimo's obligation to protect Duval's financial interests.",

                "changed_text": "Company intends to promote Duval and his association with Company Products as it deems commercially reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the company to 'aggressively promote' Duval, which sets a relatively high standard. The modified text replaces this with 'intends to promote...as it deems commercially reasonable,' which allows the company to decide the level of promotion based on its own subjective commercial judgment. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation, as the company could argue that minimal promotion is 'commercially reasonable'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract under Ohio law due to failure of good faith and fair dealing. If the promotion is so minimal as to effectively nullify the endorsement deal's value to Duval, it could be viewed as acting in bad faith.",

                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on the Licensor to ensure Duval consults with the Company regarding product development. The changed text weakens this obligation by adding qualifiers like 'use its best efforts,' 'if Duval is available,' and 'subject to Duval's other commitments.' This makes it significantly harder to enforce the consultation requirement, as the Licensor can easily argue that Duval was unavailable or had conflicting commitments.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract under Ohio law. The original clear requirement to consult could be viewed as a material part of the agreement, and weakening that obligation so substantially could be seen as a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

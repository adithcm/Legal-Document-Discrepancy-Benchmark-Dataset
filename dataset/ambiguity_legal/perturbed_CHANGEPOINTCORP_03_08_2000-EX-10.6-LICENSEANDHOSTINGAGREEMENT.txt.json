                "changed_text": "Customer acknowledges and agrees that Changepoint or licensors of Changepoint retain all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Materials, and it is understood that not everything herein transfers or conveys ownership to Customer.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Changepoint retains all rights. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'not everything herein transfers or conveys ownership,' without clearly specifying what aspects of ownership *are* transferred, if any. This could be interpreted as granting some unspecified ownership rights to the customer, conflicting with standard intellectual property protections.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright law - By creating uncertainty around ownership, this could potentially undermine Changepoint's ability to fully enforce their copyright on the software, which is protected under US and Canadian copyright laws.",

                "changed_text": "Changepoint will consider defending any claim brought against Customer alleging that the Licensed Materials infringe any copyright, patent, trade secret or trademark. If Changepoint chooses to defend, Customer agrees to cooperate.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for Changepoint to defend or settle infringement claims, subject to certain conditions. The modified text makes the defense discretionary ('Changepoint will consider defending'), removing the binding obligation. By only requiring 'cooperation' from the customer if Changepoint *chooses* to defend, it implies no obligation for Changepoint to actually indemnify the customer for legal costs, and provides no obligation for Changepoint to control the litigation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Patent and Copyright Laws: By weakening the obligation to defend and indemnify against infringement, the modification reduces the protection afforded to Corio, potentially exposing them to liabilities under US patent and copyright laws (and Canadian equivalents).",

Further, Customer shall not write or develop any derivative works or computer programs based upon any part of the Licensed Materials.",

Further, Customer shall endeavor not to write or develop any directly competing derivative works or computer programs based upon the core functionality of the Licensed Materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides strict prohibitions against reverse engineering and creating derivative works. The modified version uses ambiguous phrases like 'attempt not to,' 'any substantial part,' endeavor not to,' and directly competing derivative works.' This weakens the prohibition, making it difficult to enforce. It is unclear what constitutes an 'attempt,' a 'substantial part,' or 'directly competing' functionality.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade Secret Law & Copyright Law: The changes weaken the protection of Changepoint's trade secrets and copyrights in the software, as the ambiguous language makes it harder to prevent unauthorized reverse engineering and derivative works. This could conflict with the enforcement of intellectual property rights under both US and Canadian laws.",

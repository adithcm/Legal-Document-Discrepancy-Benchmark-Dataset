                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall incorporate and in all respects be subject to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time. Transporter may file and seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at any time and from time to time to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) and the \"General Terms and Conditions\" in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, and Transporter shall have the right to place such changes in effect in accordance with the NGA, and this Agreement shall be deemed to include such changes and any such changes",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will generally incorporate the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as it may be revised periodically. Transporter may consider filing for Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) to change rates, charges, or provisions. Transporter retains the option to place changes into effect under the NGA, and this Agreement might be deemed to include such changes.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall incorporate and in all respects be subject to' to 'will generally incorporate' and using terms like 'may consider filing' and 'retains the option', the obligation to adhere to the FERC Gas Tariff is weakened. The use of 'might be deemed' introduces further uncertainty about whether changes to the tariff will actually apply to the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved amicably may be subject to interpretation under legal principles potentially relevant to the State of Michigan.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear choice of law (Michigan). The modified clause introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan' with 'may be subject to interpretation under legal principles potentially relevant to the State of Michigan'. This suggests that Michigan law might not be strictly applied and opens the door to arguments about which legal principles are relevant and how they should be interpreted.",

                "changed_text": "All notices and communications with respect to this Agreement should preferably be in writing and sent by methods generally accepted by both parties, such as mail, email, or fax, to the addresses listed below or to addresses reasonably assumed to be valid.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'should preferably' weakens the requirement that notices must be in writing. Replacing 'other means as agreed to by the parties' with 'methods generally accepted by both parties' removes the requirement for explicit agreement on communication methods. 'Reasonably assumed to be valid' introduces subjectivity regarding acceptable addresses.",

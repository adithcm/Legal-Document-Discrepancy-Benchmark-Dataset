                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.",
                "changed_text": "Within a reasonable timeframe of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber should consider ceasing further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Bioamber will endeavor to utilize any unexpended funds received from Bioamber for a potentially different project than the BRI Project.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'within thirty (30) days' is changed to 'reasonable timeframe' which is ambiguous. 'Will cease' is changed to 'should consider ceasing,' making the action discretionary. 'Will require' is changed to 'endeavor to utilize,' further weakening the obligation and creating uncertainty. 'Project other than the BRI Project' is changed to 'potentially different project,' allowing for interpretation that unexpended funds may still be used for the BRI Project, albeit a different part of the project.",

This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as described above.\"",
                "changed_text": "\"13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber making good-faith efforts to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to primarily utilize CB1 as the biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This conversion will be carried out with consideration to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the Commercial License, it being understood that economic obligations of item (iv) above will be evaluated relative to the E. coli strain technology, and potentially the Mitsubishi strain technology. To enable such conversion, Bioamber will attempt to put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the Sarnia Plant to encourage conversion of the Sarnia Plant to mainly use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as described above.\"",
                "explanation": "Changing 'hereby agreeing to convert' to 'making good-faith efforts to convert' introduces ambiguity, making the obligation less stringent. Changing 'solely utilize' to 'primarily utilize' and 'mainly use' creates uncertainty about the extent of the conversion. Changing 'will be relative' to 'will be evaluated relative to' opens the door to considering the Mitsubishi strain technology. Changing 'Bioamber will put in place agreements...that will enable Bioamber to require' to 'Bioamber will attempt to put in place agreements...to encourage' weakens Bioamber's responsibility for ensuring conversion.",

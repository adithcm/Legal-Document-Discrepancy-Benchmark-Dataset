                "original_text": "Party A confirms that it will procure for use of the Joint Venture Company a site to be further identified and agreed by the Parties. The site shall be in the Baoding High Technology Development Zone, shall have granted land use rights, and shall have utilities that may be directly connected by the Joint Venture Company at the site.",
                "changed_text": "Party A will use its best efforts to procure a site for the Joint Venture Company. The site may be located in the Baoding High Technology Development Zone, and efforts will be made to secure land use rights and accessible utilities.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Party A confirms that it will procure' to 'Party A will use its best efforts to procure' weakens the obligation, making it less certain that a suitable site will be obtained. Replacing 'shall be' with 'may be' and adding 'efforts will be made' introduces ambiguity about the location and the availability of land use rights and utilities. This could potentially lead to delays or disputes regarding the suitability of the site, undermining the Joint Venture's operational efficiency and exposing the parties to risk. The original text implied a guaranteed outcome, while the modified text only requires a level of effort without guaranteeing a particular result.",

The Joint Venture Company's internal labor policies shall be established pursuant to relevant PRC laws and regulations, and approved by the Board of Directors.",
                "changed_text": "Matters relating to the recruitment, wages, insurance, welfare, and dismissal of the staff and workers of the Joint Venture Company will generally consider the LABOR LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA and the REGULATIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON LABOR MANAGEMENT IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT ENTERPRISES and related PRC regulations. The Joint Venture Company's internal labor policies should be established with consideration given to relevant PRC laws and regulations, and they may be approved by the Board of Directors.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be handled in accordance with' to 'will generally consider' weakens the obligation to comply strictly with Chinese labor laws. Additionally, replacing 'shall be established pursuant to' with 'should be established with consideration given to' and 'approved by the Board of Directors' to 'may be approved by the Board of Directors' further weakens the mandatory nature of compliance and introduces discretion. This could lead to practices that do not fully align with the legal requirements, potentially resulting in labor disputes or regulatory penalties.",

                "changed_text": "The Joint Venture Company will endeavor to obtain what it deems to be appropriate insurance from a provider.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall take out the required insurance from an insurance company or organization permitted by Chinese laws and regulations' with 'will endeavor to obtain what it deems to be appropriate insurance from a provider' significantly weakens the obligation. The term 'required insurance' is replaced with 'what it deems to be appropriate insurance,' making the level and type of insurance coverage subjective. The phrase 'from a provider' removes the requirement to use a Chinese-approved insurer. This weakens compliance with Chinese regulatory requirements for insurance, potentially leading to inadequate coverage or non-compliance with local laws.",

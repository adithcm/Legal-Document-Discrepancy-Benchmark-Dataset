      "Imagine a light switch. A normal computer bit is like that light switch: it can be either ON (representing 1) or OFF (representing 0).  It's one or the other, and it's always definitely one of those states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers use **qubits**.  Imagine a dimmer switch instead of a regular light switch. A qubit can be ON, OFF, *or somewhere in between*.  It's not just one thing or the other, but a combination of both at the same time, until you actually look at it.  This \"in-between\" state is called **superposition**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like flipping a coin. Before it lands, it's sort of both heads AND tails at the same time. That's superposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key concept is **entanglement**. Imagine two of these dimmer switches magically linked. If you change one, the other instantly changes too, even if they're far apart.  Entangled qubits are linked in a similar way, allowing them to work together in a coordinated fashion.\n",

Think of it like trying to find a specific key on a keyring. A regular computer tries each key one by one. A quantum computer tries all the keys *at the same time*.\n",

    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"You are a corporate legal advisor reviewing a contract for compliance. Your task is to introduce a contractual omission that removes a legally required consumer right, thereby violating state or national law.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Before modifying the text:\n",
    "    - **Read the file** to determine what city, state, or country the contract applies to.\n",
    "    - If the jurisdiction is unclear, default to **United States law**.\n",
    "    - Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Omissions occur when a contract **removes essential information**, creating legal loopholes. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract omits **a legally mandated consumer protection**, making it non-compliant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a clause that **grants consumers a legally required right**.\n",
    "    2. **Remove or modify** it so that the contract becomes **non-compliant with a law**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure that the omission introduces **legal risk** in the identified jurisdiction.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Omitting Consumer Rights:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Customers have the right to return the product within 30 days, as required by state law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Customers have the right to return the product at the company’s discretion.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Many states (e.g., California) require **minimum return periods**—removing this makes the contract non-compliant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The landlord shall provide a habitable living environment as required by law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The landlord shall make reasonable efforts to provide a habitable living environment.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Reasonable efforts\" **weakens tenant rights**, violating **housing laws**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Bank deposits are insured up to $250,000 under federal law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Bank deposits may be insured based on company policy.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Federal law **mandates insurance coverage**—removing this statement misleads consumers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Employees are entitled to paid overtime after 40 hours per week.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Overtime compensation shall be determined at the company's discretion.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** **Federal labor laws** require **clear overtime pay guidelines**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"All loan agreements must provide an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) disclosure.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Loan agreements may include an APR disclosure.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some laws **mandate APR transparency**—removing this makes loans non-compliant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The tenant shall maintain comprehensive liability insurance covering all damages arising from negligence or misconduct on the premises, with a minimum coverage amount of $2 million per occurrence. The tenant shall provide proof of insurance annually to the landlord. Failure to maintain coverage at this level shall constitute grounds for lease termination.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The tenant shall maintain liability insurance covering damages arising from negligence or misconduct on the premises. Proof of insurance may be requested by the landlord as necessary.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The removal of 'comprehensive' and the 'minimum coverage amount of $2 million per occurrence' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The deletion of the **annual proof requirement** eliminates an important compliance measure. This creates a **legal contradiction** with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial leases.\n",

      "Warning: Could not find section in text: 14. Claims Procedures. If this Agreement is subject to ERISA, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be filed with the Plan Administrator or its designee which shall make all determinations concerning such claim. Any decision by the Plan Administrator denying such claim shall be in writing and shall be delivered to all parties in interest in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 8 hereof. Such decision shall set forth the reasons for denial in plain language. Pertinent provisions of the Agreement shall be cited and, where appropriate, an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided. This notice of denial of benefits will be provided within ninety (90) days of the Plan Administrator's receipt of the claim for benefits. If the Plan Administrator fails to notify the claimant of its decision regarding the claim, the claim shall be considered denied, and the claimant then shall be permitted to proceed with an appeal as provided for in this Section 14. A claimant who has been completely or partially denied a benefit shall be entitled to appeal this denial of his or her claim by filing a written statement of his or her position with the Plan Administrator no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the written notification of such denial. The Plan Administrator shall schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal. The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for the decision, and shall cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based. Following the review of any additional information submitted by the claimant, either through the hearing process or otherwise, the Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within sixty (60) days following receipt of the request for review (or within 120 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). The Plan Administrator shall deliver the decision to the claimant in writing. If an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. If the decision on review is not furnished within the prescribed time, the claim shall be deemed denied on review.\n",

      "Okay, imagine regular computers like light switches that can only be either **on** or **off**, representing 1 or 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers are like **dimmer switches**. They can be **on, off, or somewhere in between, AND they can be in multiple states at the same time.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Bits vs. Qubits:**\n",
      "    *   **Regular computers use bits:** Like light switches, each bit represents either 0 or 1.\n",
      "    *   **Quantum computers use qubits:**  Like dimmer switches, a qubit can be 0, 1, or a combination of both simultaneously. This \"combination\" is called **superposition**.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Superposition:**\n",
      "    *   Think of it like a coin spinning in the air. It's not heads or tails until it lands. A qubit in superposition is like that spinning coin – it exists in both the \"0\" and \"1\" states at the same time.  The probability of it being either 0 or 1 when measured is what defines its state.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Entanglement:**\n",
      "    *   Imagine you have two of those spinning coins magically linked. If one lands on heads, the other *instantly* lands on tails, no matter how far apart they are.\n",
      "    *   **Entanglement links two or more qubits together.**  Knowing the state of one entangled qubit instantly tells you something about the state of the other, even if they're separated by vast distances. This allows for very complex calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Quantum Computing Power:**\n",
      "    *   Because qubits can be in multiple states at once (superposition) and linked together (entanglement), quantum computers can explore many possibilities simultaneously.  This makes them potentially much faster at solving certain types of problems than regular computers, which have to try each possibility one at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What are they good for?**\n",
      "    *   **Drug discovery:** Simulating molecules to find new medicines.\n",
      "    *   **Materials science:** Designing new materials with specific properties.\n",
      "    *   **Financial modeling:** Predicting market trends and managing risk.\n",
      "    *   **Cryptography:** Breaking codes and developing more secure communication methods.\n",
      "    *   **Optimization problems:**  Finding the best solution from a huge number of possibilities (e.g., optimizing logistics, routing, or scheduling).\n",
      "*   **Challenges:**\n",
      "    *   **Fragile:** Qubits are very sensitive to their environment. Noise and disturbances can easily disrupt their state, leading to errors.\n",
      "    *   **Expensive:** Building and maintaining quantum computers is incredibly complex and costly.\n",
      "    *   **Early stage:**  Quantum computing is still in its early stages of development. We don't have fully fault-tolerant, widely available quantum computers yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short, quantum computers leverage the bizarre rules of quantum mechanics (like superposition and entanglement) to perform calculations in a fundamentally different way than regular computers. This could potentially unlock solutions to problems that are currently impossible for even the most powerful supercomputers.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like this: Regular computers are good at doing simple things very fast. Quantum computers are potentially good at doing very complex things (that involve exploring many possibilities at once), but they are still in early development. They won't replace your phone or laptop anytime soon, but they could revolutionize fields like medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence.\n",

    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"You are a contract analyst ensuring consistency in legal agreements. Your task is to modify a document by introducing conflicting definitions of the same term within different sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Ambiguities also occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    6. Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Conflicting Definitions of a Term:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"The term ‘Client’ refers to any party who purchases our services.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Clients are defined as parties who hold an active contract for at least six months.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The first definition includes all buyers, while the second restricts \"Clients\" to long-term customers, leading to disputes over **contractual obligations**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 1:** \"Employees are eligible for health benefits upon hiring.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 6:** \"Employees are eligible for health benefits after 90 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contradiction makes it unclear when benefits apply.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"The vendor is responsible for product warranties.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Warranty claims shall be processed by the manufacturer.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It’s unclear **who holds warranty responsibility**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Data shall be stored for five years.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Data must be deleted within two years.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** A **conflicting data retention period** could violate regulations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"A shareholder is anyone holding 5% or more equity.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 7:** \"A shareholder is anyone with voting rights.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** A shareholder under one section may **not qualify in another**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The Supplier shall deliver all goods in accordance with the specifications outlined in Schedule A. Any failure to meet these specifications will be considered a material breach of contract. In such cases, the Buyer reserves the right to request a full refund or demand replacement goods within 30 days. The Supplier guarantees that all goods will conform to the quality and performance standards described in the agreement.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The Supplier shall make every effort to deliver goods in accordance with the specifications outlined in Schedule A. If specifications are not fully met, the Buyer and Supplier will engage in discussions to determine an appropriate resolution, which may include partial refunds or adjusted delivery timelines.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall deliver' with 'shall make every effort,' making performance non-binding. The original contract clearly stated that failure to meet specifications was a material breach with predefined consequences, whereas the modified version introduces an uncertain resolution process. This creates an **internal contradiction** if another part of the contract enforces strict adherence to Schedule A’s specifications.\n",

Once approved by Dova, the content of the Product Materials shall be provided by Dova to Valeant in advance of the Valeant Activates to allow for Valeant to review such content and provide verbal feedback to Dova in advance of use of the Product Materials. Within [***] of receipt of such Product Materials, Valeant shall verbally provide to Dova any comments and/or proposed revisions to such Product Materials, which comments and revisions Dova shall reasonably consider so long as Dova deems such suggestions are acceptable in the promotion of the Product; provided that in any event, to the extent that Dova reasonably believes that such changes are not in compliance with Applicable Law, the Regulatory Approval for the Product or the applicable Product Labeling, then Dova shall not be required to incorporate any such suggestions from Valeant in the Product Materials.

If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Payment in Lieu shall not include any element in relation to: (a) any bonus or discretionary payment(s) that might otherwise have been due during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made; and (b) any payment in respect of any holiday entitlement that would have accrued during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made. 15.3 The Company may pay any sums due under sub clause 15.2 in equal monthly instalments until the date on which the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 would have expired if notice had been given (the Payment Period). 15.4 The Payment in Lieu is at all times conditional on the Executive informing the Company immediately in the event that he receives, or has a right to receive, remuneration from any source in respect of his employment or the provision of his services during the Payment Period or relating to the Payment Period (remuneration shall include any salary, fee or other benefit). 15.5 If the Executive obtains alternative employment or an alternative engagement during the Payment Period any further monthly instalments of the Payment in Lieu will be reduced on a pro rata basis by any payment or remuneration in respect of such alternative employment or alternative engagement during the Payment Period or relating to the Payment Period. 15.6 The Executive shall have no right to receive a Payment in Lieu unless the Company has exercised its discretion in sub clause 15.2. 15.7 Nothing in this clause 15 shall prevent the Company from terminating the Appointment in breach of contract or of common law. 15.8 If the Executive: (a) in the reasonable opinion of the Board fails or neglects efficiently and diligently to discharge his duties, including, without limitation his duties under Chapter 2 of part 10 of the Companies Act 2006, or is guilty of any serious or repeated material breach of his obligations under this Agreement and, if that material breach is remediable, fails to remedy the breach within a period of 21 days after being notified in writing to do so; (b) is guilty of any fraud, dishonesty, serious misconduct or any other conduct which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, brings or is likely to bring the Executive or the Company or any Group Company into disrepute or affects or is likely to affect prejudicially the interests of the Company or the Group; (c) is convicted of an arrestable offence (other than a road traffic offence for which a non-custodial penalty is imposed); (d) is guilty of any material breach or material non-observance of any code of conduct, requirement, rule or regulation referred to in sub clause 3.2; (e) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; (f) is prohibited from being a director by law; (g) resigns as a director without the Company's prior consent; (h) has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a director and may remain so for more than six months, according to a written opinion issued in relation to the Executive to the Company from a registered medical practitioner who is treating the Executive; or (i) is not or ceases to be eligible to work in the UK, the Company may by written notice to the Executive terminate this Agreement with immediate effect.\n",

(a) \\\"Merchant\\\" means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill. (b) \\\"Financing agency\\\" means a bank, finance company or other person who in the ordinary course of business makes advances against goods or documents of title or who by arrangement with either the seller or the buyer intervenes in ordinary course to make or collect payment due or claimed under the contract for sale, as by purchasing or paying the seller's draft or making advances against it or by merely taking it for collection whether or not documents of title accompany or are associated with the draft. \\\"Financing agency\\\" includes also a bank or other person who similarly intervenes between persons who are in the position of seller and buyer in respect to the goods (Section 2.707 ). (c) \\\"Between merchants\\\" means in any transaction with respect to which both parties are chargeable with the knowledge or skill of merchants. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff.

DEFINITIONS: TRANSFERABILITY; \\\"GOODS\\\"; \\\"FUTURE\\\" GOODS; \\\"LOT\\\"; \\\"COMMERCIAL UNIT\\\". (a) \\\"Goods\\\" means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Chapter 8 ) and things in action. \\\"Goods\\\" also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed from realty (Section 2.107 ). (b) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are \\\"future\\\" goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell. (c) There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods. (d) An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common. (e) \\\"Lot\\\" means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract. (f) \\\"Commercial unit\\\" means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use. A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.

DEFINITIONS: \\\"CONTRACT\\\"; \\\"AGREEMENT\\\"; \\\"CONTRACT FOR SALE\\\"; \\\"SALE\\\"; \\\"PRESENT SALE\\\"; \\\"CONFORMING\\\" TO CONTRACT; \\\"TERMINATION\\\"; \\\"CANCELLATION\\\". (a) In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires \\\"contract\\\" and \\\"agreement\\\" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \\\"Contract for sale\\\" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A \\\"sale\\\" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2.401 ). A \\\"present sale\\\" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract. (b) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are \\\"conforming\\\" or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract. (c) \\\"Termination\\\" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On \\\"termination\\\" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives. (d) \\\"Cancellation\\\" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of \\\"termination\\\" except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

(a) A contract for the sale of minerals or the like (including oil and gas) or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter if they are to be severed by the seller but until severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell. (b) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in Subsection (a) or of timber to be cut is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties can by identification effect a present sale before severance. (c) The provisions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract for sale.

FORM, FORMATION AND READJUSTMENT OF CONTRACT Sec. 2.201. FORMAL REQUIREMENTS; STATUTE OF FRAUDS. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing. (b) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of Subsection (a) against such party unless written noti\"\n",

TRADE SECRETS Sec. 134A.001. SHORT TITLE. This chapter may be cited as the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act. Added by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., Ch. 10 (S.B. 953 ), Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 2013. Sec. 134A.002. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter: (1) \\\"Claimant\\\" means a party seeking to recover damages under this chapter, including a plaintiff, counterclaimant, cross-claimant, or third-party plaintiff. In an action in which a party seeks recovery of damages under this chapter on behalf of another person, \\\"claimant\\\" includes both that other person and the party seeking recovery of damages. (1-a) \\\"Clear and convincing\\\" means the measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established. (2) \\\"Improper means\\\" includes theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, to limit use, or to prohibit discovery of a trade secret, or espionage through electronic or other means. (3) \\\"Misappropriation\\\" means: (A) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or (B) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who: (i) used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; (ii) at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that the person's knowledge of the trade secret was: (a) derived from or through a person who used improper means to acquire the trade secret; (b) acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret; or (c) derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret; or (iii) before a material change of the position of the person, knew or had reason to know that the trade secret was a trade secret and that knowledge of the trade secret had been acquired by accident or mistake. (3-a) \\\"Owner\\\" means, with respect to a trade secret, the person or entity in whom or in which rightful, legal, or equitable title to, or the right to enforce rights in, the trade secret is reposed. (4) \\\"Proper means\\\" means discovery by independent development, reverse engineering unless prohibited, or any other means that is not improper means. (5) \\\"Reverse engineering\\\" means the process of studying, analyzing, or disassembling a product or device to discover its design, structure, construction, or source code provided that the product or device was acquired lawfully or from a person having the legal right to convey it. (6) \\\"Trade secret\\\" means all forms and types of information, including business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, and any formula, design, prototype, pattern, plan, compilation, program device, program, code, device, method, technique, process, procedure, financial data, or list of actual or potential customers or suppliers, whether tangible or intangible and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing if: (A) the owner of the trade secret has taken reasonable measures under the circumstances to keep the information secret; and (B) the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, another person who can obtain economic value from the disclosure or use of the information. (7) \\\"Willful and malicious misappropriation\\\" means intentional misappropriation resulting from the conscious disregard of the rights of the owner of the trade secret.

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. (a) Actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined if the order does not prohibit a person from using general knowledge, skill, and experience that person acquired during employment. (a-1) On application to the court, an injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation. (b) In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which use could have been prohibited. Exceptional circumstances include a material and prejudicial change of position before acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable. (c) In appropriate circumstances, affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by court order. Added by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., Ch. 10 (S.B. 953 ), Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 2013.

(a) In addition to or in lieu of injunctive relief, a claimant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret. (b) If willful and malicious misappropriation is proven by clear and convincing evidence, the fact finder may award exemplary damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under Subsection (a).

PRESERVATION OF SECRECY. (a) In an action under this chapter, a court shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable means. There is a presumption in favor of granting protective orders to preserve the secrecy of trade secrets. Protective orders may include provisions limiting access to confidential information to only the attorneys and their experts, holding in camera hearings, sealing the records of the action, and ordering any person involved in the litigation not to disclose an alleged trade secret without prior court approval. (b) In an action under this chapter, a presumption exists that a party is allowed to participate and assist counsel in the presentation of the party's case. At any stage of the action, the court may exclude a party and the party's representative or limit a party's access to the alleged trade secret of another party if other countervailing interests overcome the presumption. In making this determination, the court must conduct a balancing test that considers: (1) the value of an owner's alleged trade secret; (2) the degree of competitive harm an owner would suffer from the dissemination of the owner's alleged trade secret to the other party; (3) whether the owner is alleging that the other party is already in possession of the alleged trade secret; (4) whether a party's representative acts as a competitive decision maker; (5) the degree to which a party's defense would be impaired by limiting that party's access to the alleged trade secret; (6) whether a party or a party's representative possesses specialized expertise that would not be available to a party's outside expert; and (7) the stage of the action.

EFFECT ON OTHER LAW. (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b), this chapter displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary, and other law of this state providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret. (b) This chapter does not affect: (1) contractual remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; (2) other civil remedies that are not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; or (3) criminal remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret. (c) To the extent that this chapter conflicts with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, this chapter controls. Notwithstanding Section 22.004 , Government Code, the supreme court may not amend or adopt rules in conflict with this chapter. (d) This chapter does not affect the disclosure of public information by a governmental body under Chapter 552 , Government Code. Added by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., Ch. 10 (S.B. 953 ), Sec. 1, eff.

    "       - Record the **location** (section or paragraph number) where the term was changed.\n",
    "       - Also identify and record the **contradicted_location** — this is where the contradiction appears or becomes contradictory due to the change. This could be another section where the original definition is expected to apply or due to the change it creates an in-text contradiction in this location.\n",
    "       - If the contradiction affects multiple sections, include the **most directly impacted** one.\n",
    "       - Extract the **full contradicted_text** from that location — this should be the complete section or paragraph that reflects the conflict caused by the omission intext contradiction perturbation. Include the entire section to preserve legal context.\n",
    "       - Also keep in mind the contradicted_location, doesn't have to be the same location where the perturbation was made. A perturbation can be made in one location and contradict somewhere in the text in another location\n",

    "    ### **Examples of Conflicting Payment Terms:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"Invoices must be paid within 45 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Late fees apply if invoices are unpaid after 30 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** One section allows **45 days**, but the other **charges late fees after 30 days**, creating ambiguity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 6:** \"Security deposits are fully refundable.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Security deposits are non-refundable.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It is unclear whether **deposits must be returned**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Early termination fees apply if the contract is ended before 12 months.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 10:** \"Clients may terminate at any time without penalty.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Conflicting clauses **cause uncertainty about termination fees**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 5:** \"Payment plans must be completed within 6 months.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 11:** \"Customers may extend payment plans up to 12 months.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Different sections **contradict the maximum payment period**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Interest on late payments accrues at 5% per month.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 14:** \"No interest will be charged on late payments.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** **Conflicting interest policies** could lead to legal disputes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"For the purposes of this Agreement, the term 'Affiliate' shall refer to any entity that is controlled by, controls, or is under common control with either party. The term 'control' shall mean ownership of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the voting equity in such entity. Affiliates shall be entitled to the same rights and obligations as the contracting party.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"For the purposes of this Agreement, the term 'Affiliate' shall refer to any entity that is affiliated with, works in conjunction with, or has a strategic partnership with either party. Affiliates may be granted certain rights and obligations as determined by the contracting party on a case-by-case basis.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The modified text **creates an in-text contradiction** by **changing the definition of \"Affiliate\"** to include strategic partnerships and loosely affiliated entities, rather than just entities **under majority control**. This contradicts other contract sections that **rely on the original definition** (51% ownership) to determine rights and obligations. Additionally, **allowing case-by-case determination** undermines the original intent of treating affiliates the same as contracting parties, introducing **legal uncertainty** and **potential disputes over obligations**.\n",

Dova shall be solely responsible for ensuring that the Product Materials prepared and approved by it are in compliance with the Regulatory Approval for the Product, the Product Labeling and Applicable Law. Once approved by Dova, the content of the Product Materials shall be provided by Dova to Valeant in advance of the Valeant Activates to allow for Valeant to review such content and provide verbal feedback to Dova in advance of use of the Product Materials. Within [***] of receipt of such Product Materials, Valeant shall verbally provide to Dova any comments and/or proposed revisions to such Product Materials, which comments and revisions Dova shall reasonably consider so long as Dova deems such suggestions are acceptable in the promotion of the Product; provided that in any event, to the extent that Dova reasonably believes that such changes are not in compliance with Applicable Law, the Regulatory Approval for the Product or the applicable Product Labeling, then Dova shall not be required to incorporate any such suggestions from Valeant in the Product Materials. In the event of any disagreement between the Parties regarding any feedback received from Valeant with respect to the Product Materials, Dova shall have the right to conclusively determine such matter.

Valeant shall use only Product Materials approved by Dova in the performance of Valeant Activities under this Agreement; provided, however, that Valeant shall not be required to use any Product Materials that have not been approved by Valeant or which have not incorporated comments provided by Valeant and nothing herein shall require Valeant to use all Product Materials created or prepared by Dova and Valeant reserves the right not to use certain Product Materials. The content of Product Materials shall not be modified or changed by Valeant or Field Force Personnel at any time without the prior written approval of Dova in each instance. Dova shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of creation and development of the Product Materials and Valeant shall be responsible for the costs and expense of reproduction, printing and delivery of the Product Materials to and for Valeant.

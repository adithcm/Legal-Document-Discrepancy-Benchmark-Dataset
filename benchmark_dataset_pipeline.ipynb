    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    6. Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -----\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Different Terminology for the Same Concept:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 1:** \"The Vendor shall supply goods within 30 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 7:** \"The Supplier shall ensure delivery within 60 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It’s unclear whether **“Vendor” and “Supplier”** refer to the same entity, leading to conflicting delivery terms.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"The Client is responsible for compliance with all data privacy laws.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 10:** \"The Customer must ensure compliance with all data regulations.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It’s unclear whether **“Client” and “Customer”** are interchangeable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Security breaches must be reported to the Compliance Officer.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Data incidents must be escalated to the Security Team.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The document fails to define whether **“security breaches” and “data incidents”** are the same.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"Employees must follow the HR Manual for grievance resolution.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Personnel must refer to the Workplace Handbook for grievance handling.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** **“HR Manual” and “Workplace Handbook”** are undefined—this could cause **disputes over policies**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 7:** \"The seller warrants that all goods are defect-free.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 15:** \"The distributor ensures that all products meet quality standards.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** **“Seller” and “Distributor”** may not be the same entity, leading to **liability confusion**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The employee shall be entitled to overtime pay for any hours worked beyond 40 hours per week, calculated at 1.5 times the regular hourly rate. Overtime pay shall be included in the next payroll cycle and must be properly documented.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The employee may receive additional compensation for any hours worked beyond the normal workweek, subject to company policy.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The original text enforces **overtime pay as a legal right**, whereas the modified version replaces **'overtime pay'** with **'additional compensation'** and makes it subject to 'company policy.' This contradicts **labor laws (FLSA)**, which mandate **overtime pay at 1.5x the hourly rate**.\n",

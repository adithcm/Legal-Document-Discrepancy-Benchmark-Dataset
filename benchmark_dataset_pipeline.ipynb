(a) \\\"Merchant\\\" means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill. (b) \\\"Financing agency\\\" means a bank, finance company or other person who in the ordinary course of business makes advances against goods or documents of title or who by arrangement with either the seller or the buyer intervenes in ordinary course to make or collect payment due or claimed under the contract for sale, as by purchasing or paying the seller's draft or making advances against it or by merely taking it for collection whether or not documents of title accompany or are associated with the draft. \\\"Financing agency\\\" includes also a bank or other person who similarly intervenes between persons who are in the position of seller and buyer in respect to the goods (Section 2.707 ). (c) \\\"Between merchants\\\" means in any transaction with respect to which both parties are chargeable with the knowledge or skill of merchants. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff.

DEFINITIONS: TRANSFERABILITY; \\\"GOODS\\\"; \\\"FUTURE\\\" GOODS; \\\"LOT\\\"; \\\"COMMERCIAL UNIT\\\". (a) \\\"Goods\\\" means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Chapter 8 ) and things in action. \\\"Goods\\\" also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed from realty (Section 2.107 ). (b) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are \\\"future\\\" goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell. (c) There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods. (d) An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common. (e) \\\"Lot\\\" means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract. (f) \\\"Commercial unit\\\" means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use. A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.

DEFINITIONS: \\\"CONTRACT\\\"; \\\"AGREEMENT\\\"; \\\"CONTRACT FOR SALE\\\"; \\\"SALE\\\"; \\\"PRESENT SALE\\\"; \\\"CONFORMING\\\" TO CONTRACT; \\\"TERMINATION\\\"; \\\"CANCELLATION\\\". (a) In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires \\\"contract\\\" and \\\"agreement\\\" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \\\"Contract for sale\\\" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A \\\"sale\\\" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2.401 ). A \\\"present sale\\\" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract. (b) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are \\\"conforming\\\" or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract. (c) \\\"Termination\\\" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On \\\"termination\\\" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives. (d) \\\"Cancellation\\\" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of \\\"termination\\\" except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

(a) A contract for the sale of minerals or the like (including oil and gas) or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter if they are to be severed by the seller but until severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell. (b) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in Subsection (a) or of timber to be cut is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties can by identification effect a present sale before severance. (c) The provisions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract for sale.

FORM, FORMATION AND READJUSTMENT OF CONTRACT Sec. 2.201. FORMAL REQUIREMENTS; STATUTE OF FRAUDS. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing. (b) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of Subsection (a) against such party unless written noti\"\n",

In an action in which a party seeks recovery of damages under this chapter on behalf of another person, \\\"claimant\\\" includes both that other person and the party seeking recovery of damages. (1-a) \\\"Clear and convincing\\\" means the measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established. (2) \\\"Improper means\\\" includes theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, to limit use, or to prohibit discovery of a trade secret, or espionage through electronic or other means.

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. (a) Actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined if the order does not prohibit a person from using general knowledge, skill, and experience that person acquired during employment. (a-1) On application to the court, an injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation. (b) In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which use could have been prohibited. Exceptional circumstances include a material and prejudicial change of position before acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable.

(a) In addition to or in lieu of injunctive relief, a claimant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.

PRESERVATION OF SECRECY. (a) In an action under this chapter, a court shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable means. There is a presumption in favor of granting protective orders to preserve the secrecy of trade secrets. Protective orders may include provisions limiting access to confidential information to only the attorneys and their experts, holding in camera hearings, sealing the records of the action, and ordering any person involved in the litigation not to disclose an alleged trade secret without prior court approval. (b) In an action under this chapter, a presumption exists that a party is allowed to participate and assist counsel in the presentation of the party's case. At any stage of the action, the court may exclude a party and the party's representative or limit a party's access to the alleged trade secret of another party if other countervailing interests overcome the presumption. In making this determination, the court must conduct a balancing test that considers: (1) the value of an owner's alleged trade secret; (2) the degree of competitive harm an owner would suffer from the dissemination of the owner's alleged trade secret to the other party; (3) whether the owner is alleging that the other party is already in possession of the alleged trade secret; (4) whether a party's representative acts as a competitive decision maker; (5) the degree to which a party's defense would be impaired by limiting that party's access to the alleged trade secret; (6) whether a party or a party's representative possesses specialized expertise that would not be available to a party's outside expert; and (7) the stage of the action.

EFFECT ON OTHER LAW. (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b), this chapter displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary, and other law of this state providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret. (b) This chapter does not affect: (1) contractual remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; (2) other civil remedies that are not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; or (3) criminal remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret. (c) To the extent that this chapter conflicts with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, this chapter controls. Notwithstanding Section 22.004 , Government Code, the supreme court may not amend or adopt rules in conflict with this chapter. (d) This chapter does not affect the disclosure of public information by a governmental body under Chapter 552 , Government Code. Added by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., Ch. 10 (S.B. 953 ), Sec. 1, eff.

      "**Analysis of Snippets:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Snippet 1 (Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code ยง 151.002):**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Snippet Content:**  The snippet focuses on the process of referring a case to a special judge, including requirements for motions, qualifications of the judge, and procedures.  It defines aspects of trial by special judge\n",
      "    *   **Law Explanation:** Argues that the modified text creates ambiguity in an indemnification clause and could be interpreted as unenforceable under Texas law.\n",
      "    *   **Accuracy/Relevance:**  **Low.** This snippet is not directly related to the core concept of indemnity agreements or negligence. It focuses on a completely different area of civil practice.  While the broader chapter might contain relevant information, the *specific* snippet provided doesn't help support the explanation. It's misleading.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Snippet 2 (Texas Business and Commerce Code ยง 2.306):**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Snippet Content:** This snippet provides general definitions and principles of construction of the chapter, including definitions like \"Merchant\", \"Financing agency\", \"Goods\", \"Contract for sale\", etc.\n",
      "    *   **Law Explanation:** States that the reduction of 'best efforts' to 'generally attempt' can be interpreted as a lack of good faith, especially if only 'some' clients are promoted.\n",
      "    *   **Accuracy/Relevance:** **Low.** This snippet is too general. While the *chapter* likely contains sections on \"good faith\" and \"reasonable commercial standards\" as they relate to sales, this *specific* snippet is mostly definitions. It does not mention any part that describes how companies should fulfill a good faith effort. You'd need a snippet that *explicitly* defines good faith obligations in a commercial context to justify the explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Snippet 3 (Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code ยง 134A.002):**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Snippet Content:** This snippet defines terms within the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA), including \"Claimant,\" \"Improper Means,\" \"Misappropriation,\" \"Trade Secret,\" etc.\n",
      "    *   **Law Explanation:** States that the original text, with its specific five-year term and 'every reasonable precaution,' aligns with the TUTSA's requirement of reasonable efforts to maintain trade secret secrecy.\n",
      "    *   **Accuracy/Relevance:** **Medium to High.** This snippet is *more* relevant than the previous two.  The definition of \"Trade Secret\" includes the requirement that \"the owner of the trade secret has taken reasonable measures under the circumstances to keep the information secret.\"  The snippet directly supports the argument that weakening the confidentiality clause undermines those \"reasonable measures.\" However, the snippet alone doesn't *prove* the point. Someone reading the law section may still believe the new language is reasonable. So it is up to the judge to discern if that clause is good enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the snippets provided **aren't strong enough** to fully justify the legal explanations. They are, at best, tangential to the core legal arguments. Especially the first two are low. The last one has a decent correlation but not completely strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's why and what to improve:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Specificity is Key:** The snippets should be *directly* relevant to the legal concepts being discussed in the \"law_explanation.\"  If you're arguing about \"good faith,\" the snippet should define \"good faith\" or outline the duties associated with it. If you're talking about indemnification, the snippet should address the enforceability or requirements of such agreements.\n",
      "*   **Context is Important:**  Legal arguments often depend on nuanced interpretations.  A broader snippet might be necessary to provide the proper context for understanding the relevant section of the law.\n",
      "*   **Completeness:** If the legal explanation hinges on multiple factors within a law, the snippet should ideally include all relevant sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Improve Your Scraping:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Targeted Scraping:**  Don't just scrape the entire webpage for a statute. Use precise selectors (e.g., CSS selectors or XPath) to extract the *exact* sections of the law that are most relevant to your argument.\n",
      "2.  **Keyword/Concept-Based Scraping:** Instead of simply scraping based on the \"law_citation,\" analyze the \"law_explanation\" to identify key terms and concepts (e.g., \"good faith,\" \"reasonable measures,\" \"indemnification,\" \"negligence\"). Use these terms to refine your scraping queries and find more relevant sections.\n",
      "3.  **Expand the Snippet (Judiciously):**  If a short snippet doesn't provide enough context, consider expanding the scrape to include a paragraph or two before and after the most relevant section.  Be careful not to include irrelevant information, though.\n",
      "4.  **Verify Relevance:** After scraping, *manually review* the snippet to ensure it directly supports the \"law_explanation.\"  If it doesn't, revise your scraping strategy.\n",
      "5.  **Consider Multiple Snippets:** If the \"law_explanation\" draws on multiple sections of the law, include multiple \"scraped_snippet\" entries in your JSON.\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on *precision* and *relevance* in your scraping, you can significantly improve the quality and persuasiveness of your legal NLP project.\n",

    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"You are a state regulatory compliance officer ensuring that legal contracts align with statutory definitions. Your task is to modify a contract so that a key term contradicts its definition under state or federal law.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Before modifying the text:\n",
    "    - **Read the file** to determine what city, state, or country the contract applies to.\n",
    "    - If the jurisdiction is unclear, default to **United States law**.\n",
    "    - Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Misaligned terminology occurs when a contract **uses terms that do not match their statutory meaning**, leading to non-compliance. A **legal contradiction** in this category arises when contractual language deviates from legally recognized definitions, making the contract unenforceable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "        1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "        2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "        3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "        4. Use online legal databases or verified government resources to **find a real law that is contradicted**.\n",
    "        5. For that contradiction, extract:\n",
    "           - **The citation/title of the law**\n",
    "           - **A direct link (URL)** to the government/legal source that confirms this law\n",
    "           - **A brief explanation of how the modified text contradicts this law (law_explanation)**.\n",
    "        6. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "        7. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Conflicting Contract and Statutory Terms:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The employee shall be considered an independent contractor.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The worker shall be considered an independent contractor.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some states define **โworkerโ differently from โindependent contractorโ** under employment laws, leading to misclassification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Bank deposits are federally insured up to $250,000.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Bank deposits may be insured at the institutionโs discretion.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This contradicts **FDIC insurance laws**, which guarantee deposit protection.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"A tenant has the right to a habitable living environment.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"A tenant has the right to request habitability improvements.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Federal **tenant protection laws** mandate a **clear landlord obligation**, which this change removes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Employees are entitled to paid overtime after 40 hours per week.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Overtime pay shall be determined based on business needs.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)** mandates **fixed overtime rules**โthis modification makes it discretionary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"All sales agreements must disclose total finance charges.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Finance charge disclosure is encouraged but not required.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)** requires **clear disclosure** of finance charges.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The lessee shall be responsible for all maintenance and repair costs associated with the leased property, except those classified as structural repairs, which shall be the responsibility of the lessor. Structural repairs include foundation, roof, and exterior load-bearing walls.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The lessee shall be responsible for all upkeep and general property repairs, except for major repairs, which shall be handled by the lessor.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The term **'structural repairs'** was replaced with **'major repairs'**, creating legal uncertainty. Structural repairs have a clear **legal definition**, whereas 'major repairs' is vague and open to interpretation. This contradicts the intent of the contract and could lead to disputes over **repair responsibilities** under real estate law.\n",

    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"You are a senior compliance officer reviewing a legal contract. Your task is to modify a section of the contract by introducing an ambiguous legal obligation while ensuring that the ambiguity contradicts a state or national law.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Before modifying the text:\n",
    "    - **Read the file** to determine what city, state, or country the contract applies to.\n",
    "    - If the jurisdiction is unclear, default to **United States law**.\n",
    "    - Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Ambiguities occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a clear legal obligation in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify the wording to make it **vague or open to multiple interpretations**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure that this ambiguity creates **non-compliance with a specific law** in the identified jurisdiction.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Ambiguous Legal Obligations:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The company shall provide necessary accommodations for disabled employees.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The company shall provide accommodations for disabled employees as deemed appropriate.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The term \"as deemed appropriate\" introduces ambiguity, conflicting with **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**, which mandates **clear, non-discretionary accommodations**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"All contractors must comply with local zoning laws.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"All contractors must make reasonable efforts to comply with zoning laws.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Reasonable efforts\" is vague—some zoning laws require strict adherence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The landlord shall ensure habitable living conditions in compliance with state law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The landlord shall make efforts to maintain habitable conditions.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Make efforts\" does not guarantee habitability, which violates **tenant protection laws**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The company shall maintain data security measures that meet industry standards.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The company shall maintain data security measures that it deems sufficient.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Deems sufficient\" is subjective and contradicts **GDPR and CCPA** requirements for **specific security standards**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Employees shall be provided meal breaks as required by law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Employees shall be encouraged to take meal breaks.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some states require **mandatory** meal breaks (e.g., California).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The Contractor shall comply with all federal and state regulations governing workplace safety, ensuring all necessary precautions are taken to protect employees from occupational hazards. The Contractor must conduct quarterly safety inspections and submit reports to regulatory authorities. Any violations of safety standards shall result in corrective actions and potential penalties. The company’s leadership is responsible for ensuring full compliance at all levels.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The Contractor should make reasonable efforts to comply with applicable federal and state regulations governing workplace safety. The Contractor may conduct periodic safety inspections and submit reports when deemed necessary. Violations of safety standards will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and corrective actions may be recommended where appropriate.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall comply' with 'should make reasonable efforts,' making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. The removal of 'quarterly safety inspections' eliminates a clear legal requirement, and replacing 'shall result in corrective actions' with 'may be recommended' creates uncertainty. This contradicts **OSHA regulations**, which mandate strict compliance and routine reporting on workplace safety violations.\n",

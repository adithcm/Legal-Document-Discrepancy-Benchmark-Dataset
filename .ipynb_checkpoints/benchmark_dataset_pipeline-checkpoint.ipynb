      "Imagine regular computers like light switches: they can be either on (1) or off (0). These are bits. Quantum computers are like dimmer switches: they can be on, off, *or* somewhere in between, and even on and off *at the same time*. These are qubits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Bits vs. Qubits:**\n",
      "    * **Bits:** Think of a light switch. Can be either 0 (off) or 1 (on).  That's it.\n",
      "    * **Qubits:** Think of a dimmer switch *and* a magical property.  It can be 0, 1, or a combination of both *simultaneously*. This \"simultaneousness\" is called **superposition**.  It's like the qubit is exploring many possibilities at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Superposition:** Imagine flipping a coin in the air.  Before it lands, it's neither heads nor tails, but a mixture of both possibilities. A qubit in superposition is similar, existing in a mix of 0 and 1 until measured.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Entanglement:**  Imagine you have two of these magical coins. If they're entangled, when one lands on heads, the other *instantly* lands on tails, no matter how far apart they are.  Entangled qubits are linked in a similar way.  Measuring the state of one instantly tells you the state of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, how does this make quantum computers powerful?**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Parallelism:** Because qubits can be in multiple states at once (superposition), a quantum computer can explore many possible solutions to a problem simultaneously. This is like trying out many different paths at the same time, rather than one at a time like a regular computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Complexity:** Entanglement allows qubits to work together in powerful ways, enabling quantum computers to tackle problems that are too complex for even the most powerful supercomputers today.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it like searching a maze:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Regular Computer:** Tries one path at a time. If it hits a dead end, it backtracks and tries another.\n",
      "* **Quantum Computer:** Explores *all* the paths at the same time, quickly finding the exit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are quantum computers good for?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers are still in their early stages, but they have the potential to revolutionize fields like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Drug Discovery:** Simulating molecules to design new drugs and therapies.\n",
      "* **Materials Science:** Developing new materials with specific properties.\n",
      "* **Financial Modeling:**  Creating more accurate and sophisticated financial models.\n",
      "* **Cryptography:** Breaking existing encryption methods and developing new, more secure ones.\n",
      "* **Artificial Intelligence:** Training AI models more efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers use qubits, which can be in multiple states at once (superposition) and entangled with each other. This allows them to perform complex calculations much faster than regular computers, opening up new possibilities in various fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a complex topic, but hopefully this simplified explanation gives you a basic understanding of what quantum computing is all about.\n",

    "    1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    6. Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Missing Clauses Creating Inconsistencies:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 5:** \"If the contract is terminated, the client shall receive a prorated refund.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"Refund calculations shall be based on monthly service fees.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contract **still references refunds**, but there\u2019s **no formula provided**, making enforcement ambiguous.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"The vendor is responsible for defective products.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"The vendor must provide free replacements.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Section 2 **still requires responsibility**, but there\u2019s **no requirement for replacements**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Employees may appeal a termination decision.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"The appeals process is outlined in Section 12.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contract **references an appeals process**, but that process **no longer exists**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Late payments incur a penalty.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"The penalty shall be a 5% surcharge.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** **The penalty is still mentioned**, but its amount is **undefined**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 7:** \"Clients must comply with security audits.\"\n",
    "    - **Omitted Clause:** \"Security audit requirements are listed in Appendix A.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contract **references an appendix that no longer exists**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The employer shall provide employees with a 30-minute unpaid meal break for every five consecutive hours worked, in compliance with state labor laws. The employer must also provide a second 30-minute break if an employee\u2019s shift exceeds 10 hours. Employees are not required to perform any work duties during their break periods.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The employer shall provide employees with meal breaks in accordance with internal policies. Employees are encouraged to take breaks as needed.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** By removing the specific **30-minute meal break requirement**, the modified text contradicts **state labor laws** that mandate legally defined break periods. 'Encouraged to take breaks' introduces uncertainty, suggesting that breaks are discretionary rather than required. This contradicts state law if another contract section claims full compliance with labor regulations.\n",

      "Warning: Could not find section in text: \u00a7 6 Advertising Cost Compensation (1) element 5 will pay Affiliate its advertising costs (including Vat, if any, on presentation of a valid VAT invoice) if an end user arrives via the link integrated in Affiliate's Web site at the order page hosted by element 5 for the respective Software Publisher's Product under this Agreement and end user uses the automatic ordering system that carries out the registration and payment processing, so that the Affiliate's link is deemed to be directly causative for the entry of the End User into the agreement with the Software Publisher and End User's payment, proving that all requirements are irrevocably met (\"agreements arising in a qualified manner\"). Affiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned. (2) Insofar as the referred end user accepts cookies when clicking on Affiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do arise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or possibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher via integrated link. (3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate. (4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user. The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be stipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the effective gross sales price of the software. (5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own discretion. (6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program. (7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or check, as chosen by the Affiliate. (8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.\n",

(a) To the extent any Upgrade Offer has not been terminated and an Obligor satisfies all of the terms and conditions of such Upgrade Offer in respect of a Receivable, and (i) the Marketing Agent fails to make, or to cause the related Originator to make, the required Upgrade Payment into the Collection Account as set forth in Section 4.3(g) and (ii) the Parent Support Provider fails to make any required Upgrade Payments as set forth in Section 1 of the Parent Support Agreement, the Servicer and the Marketing Agent shall terminate all Upgrade Offers within ten (10) Business Days after the date the Parent Support Provider received notice from the Indenture Trustee that an Upgrade Payment was due under Section 1 of the Parent Support Agreement. (b) If the Marketing Agent, the relevant Originator and the Parent Support Provider fail to make such Upgrade Payments with respect to an Upgrade Offer, (i) the Servicer shall deliver the notice to Obligors pursuant to Section 3.13 with respect to such Obligors' recoupment rights against Verizon Wireless, and (ii) notwithstanding any failure to deliver such notice, (x) if Cellco is still the Servicer, the Servicer shall give a monthly credit to the Obligor against amounts owing with respect to the new device payment plan agreement resulting from the Upgrade Offer, in an amount equal to the amount due that month under the original device payment plan agreement that is a Receivable, or (y) if Cellco is no longer the Servicer, Cellco, (1) if required, shall give such monthly credit to the Obligor only if Cellco has received notice from the Servicer that the Obligor has paid the amount due in the prior month under the original device payment plan agreement that is a Receivable, and (2) shall cooperate with any Successor Servicer to properly bill and credit such Obligor's account with respect to the Receivable and the new device payment plan agreement related to the Upgrade Offer. Any such monthly credit granted to an Obligor shall be applied directly against the monthly payment due on the new device payment plan agreement and will not be applied in accordance with the Servicer's customary payment application procedures pursuant to its Servicing Procedures, if different. For the avoidance of doubt, if during such time as Cellco is no longer the Servicer, an Obligor remits the full amount due under the related new device payment plan agreement, but does not make a payment to the new Servicer for the original device payment plan agreement, a portion of such amount equal to the amount of the monthly credit granted to such Obligor resulting from the Upgrade Offer in respect of the original device payment plan agreement that is a Receivable shall be paid by Cellco to the new Servicer. In such case, to the extent that all other amounts owed on the related account are current, the Servicer will not consider such account or payments under the new device payment plan agreement to be Delinquent. In addition, regardless of whether Cellco continues to be the Servicer of any Receivable for which the terms and conditions of an Upgrade Offer (other than the requirement that the Marketing Agent remit, or cause the related Originator to remit, an Upgrade Payment for such Receivable) were satisfied by the related Obligor and for which the Marketing Agent, the related Originator and the Parent Support Provider failed to make the related Upgrade Payment, Cellco shall remit any Collections received on such Receivable to the Collection Account in the time period in which it would have been otherwise obligated to do so.\n",

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT 15.1 The Appointment may be terminated by either party giving the other at least 12 months' notice in writing. 15.2 The Company may in its sole and absolute discretion (whether or not any notice of termination has been given under sub clause 15.1) terminate this Agreement at any time and with immediate effect by giving notice in writing to the Executive that the Company is exercising its rights pursuant to this clause 15. If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Payment in Lieu shall not include any element in relation to: (a) any bonus or discretionary payment(s) that might otherwise have been due during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made; and (b) any payment in respect of any holiday entitlement that would have accrued during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made. 15.3 The Company may pay any sums due under sub clause 15.2 in equal monthly instalments until the date on which the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 would have expired if notice had been given (the Payment Period). 15.4 The Payment in Lieu is at all times conditional on the Executive informing the Company immediately in the event that he receives, or has a right to receive, remuneration from any source in respect of his employment or the provision of his services during the Payment Period or relating to the Payment Period (remuneration shall include any salary, fee or other benefit). 15.5 If the Executive obtains alternative employment or an alternative engagement during the Payment Period any further monthly instalments of the Payment in Lieu will be reduced on a pro rata basis by any payment or remuneration in respect of such alternative employment or alternative engagement during the Payment Period or relating to the Payment Period. 15.6 The Executive shall have no right to receive a Payment in Lieu unless the Company has exercised its discretion in sub clause 15.2. 15.7 Nothing in this clause 15 shall prevent the Company from terminating the Appointment in breach of contract or of common law. 15.8 If the Executive: (a) in the reasonable opinion of the Board fails or neglects efficiently and diligently to discharge his duties, including, without limitation his duties under Chapter 2 of part 10 of the Companies Act 2006, or is guilty of any serious or repeated material breach of his obligations under this Agreement and, if that material breach is remediable, fails to remedy the breach within a period of 21 days after being notified in writing to do so; (b) is guilty of any fraud, dishonesty, serious misconduct or any other conduct which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, brings or is likely to bring the Executive or the Company or any Group Company into disrepute or affects or is likely to affect prejudicially the interests of the Company or the Group; (c) is convicted of an arrestable offence (other than a road traffic offence for which a non-custodial penalty is imposed); (d) is guilty of any material breach or material non-observance of any code of conduct, requirement, rule or regulation referred to in sub clause 3.2; (e) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; (f) is prohibited from being a director by law; (g) resigns as a director without the Company's prior consent; (h) has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a director and may remain so for more than six months, according to a written opinion issued in relation to the Executive to the Company from a registered medical practitioner who is treating the Executive; or (i) is not or ceases to be eligible to work in the UK, the Company may by written notice to the Executive terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. 15.9 The Company's rights under clause 15.8 are without prejudice to any other rights that it might have at common law to terminate the Appointment or to accept any breach of this Agreement by the Executive as having brought the agreement to an end. Any delay by the Company in exercising its rights shall not constitute a waiver thereof. 15.10 On the Termination Date or, at the request of the Board on either party giving notice to terminate this Agreement, the Executive will immediately: (a) deliver to the Company all other property in his possession, custody or under his control belonging to any Group Company including (but not limited to) computers and any other electronic devices, business cards, credit and charge cards, security passes, original and copy documents or other media on which information is held in his possession relating to the business or affairs of any Group Company; and (b) to the extent possible, irretrievably delete (without keeping any copies in any format) any information relating to the business or affairs of the Company or any Group Company or any of its or their business contacts from any computer or communications systems, including any website or email account, owned or used by the Executive outside the Company's premises and notify the Company of any passwords the Executive used in relation to its computer system. 15.11 If the Executive's rights or benefits under any share option or share incentive scheme in which the Executive may participate (as set out at the date hereof in Schedule 2) are affected by the termination of the Employment, his rights will be determined solely in accordance with the rules of the relevant scheme and the Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation for the loss of any rights or benefits under such scheme. 15.12 If the Appointment is terminated for the purpose of the reconstruction or amalgamation of the Company or by reason of the Company transferring all or a substantial part of its business to another company and the Executive is offered employment by the reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company on similar terms to the terms of this Agreement, the Executive will have no claim\n",

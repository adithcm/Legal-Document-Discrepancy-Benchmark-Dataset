        "original_text": "B.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",

For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 14, 2006.",
        "explanation": "This modification shortens the repayment period to 14 days, which may create undue hardship and conflict with general principles of contract law regarding reasonable timeframes for fulfilling financial obligations.",

        "law_citation": "UCC § 1-304. Obligation of Good Faith.",
        "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-304",
        "law_explanation": "The Uniform Commercial Code, Section 1-304, implies an obligation of good faith in the performance and enforcement of contracts. While this contract is not explicitly governed by the UCC as it is an endorsement agreement, the principle of good faith and fair dealing suggests that contract terms, including payment deadlines, should be reasonable. A 14-day repayment period might be considered unreasonably short in some circumstances, especially considering the potential amount to be repaid, thus conflicting with the implied duty of good faith.",

        "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for exercising termination rights to 30 days from 90 may be deemed unreasonable if a longer investigation is needed, potentially conflicting with legal precedents that require fairness and reasonable opportunity to investigate before terminating a contract for cause.",

        "law_explanation": "The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 241 lists circumstances significant in determining whether a failure is material (and thus justifies termination).  Comment d suggests considering the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing. Reducing the period to terminate to 30 days, would leave little time for any such behaviour and for the terminating party to come to any conclusion based on fair dealing.",

If CONSULTANT disapproves, the reasons therefore shall be given to ADAMS GOLF in writing within three (3) business days or shall be deemed approved.",
        "changed_text": "Prior to publishing or placing any advertising or promotional material which uses CONSULTANT'S name, facsimile signature, nickname, voice or likeness, ADAMS GOLF shall submit the same to CONSULTANT, or CONSULTANT'S designee, for approval. If CONSULTANT disapproves, the reasons therefore shall be given to ADAMS GOLF in writing within one (1) business day or shall be deemed approved.",
        "explanation": "Reducing the approval timeframe to one business day may be insufficient for a thorough review, especially for complex advertising materials, potentially conflicting with the Consultant's right to protect their image and likeness, and general principles of fairness in contract performance.",

        "law_explanation": "Kansas Statutes § 60-3227 protects an individual's right to control the commercial use of their identity, including their name and likeness. While the contract provides for approval of advertising materials, reducing the review period to one business day could be argued as effectively undermining this right by not allowing adequate time for the consultant to review and object to potentially damaging or misrepresentative uses of their image. This effectively gives the licensee the right to use a person's image and likeness with little or no consent, despite the law.",

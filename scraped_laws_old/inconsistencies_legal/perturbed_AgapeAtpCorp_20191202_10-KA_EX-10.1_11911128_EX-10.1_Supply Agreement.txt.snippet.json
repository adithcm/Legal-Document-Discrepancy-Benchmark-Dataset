        "law_explanation": "Section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 implies a condition that goods sold in the course of a business are of satisfactory quality. The modification attempts to waive this implied condition, but it is difficult to exclude liability for latent defects without clear and unambiguous language and the buyer being fully aware of the terms, which may not be the case. Therefore, the altered clause could be challenged under English law.",

U.K. (1) Except as provided by this section and section 15 below and subject to any other enactment, there is no implied [ F1 term ] about the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale. [ F2 (2) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an implied term that the goods supplied under the contract are of satisfactory quality. (2A) For the purposes of this Act, goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances. (2B) For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition and the following (among others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of goods— (a) fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied, (b) appearance and finish, (c) freedom from minor defects, (d) safety, and (e) durability. (2C) The term implied by subsection (2) above does not extend to any matter making the quality of goods unsatisfactory— (a) which is specifically drawn to the buyer’s attention before the contract is made, (b) where the buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, which that examination ought to reveal, or (c) in the case of a contract for sale by sample, which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample. ] F3 ( 2D ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(3) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business and the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known— (a) to the seller, or (b) where the purchase price or part of it is payable by instalments and the goods were previously sold by a credit-broker to the seller, to that credit-broker, any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought, there is an implied [ F1 term ] that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly supplied, except where the circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the skill or judgment of the seller or credit-broker. (4) An implied [ F1 term ] about quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be annexed to a contract of sale by usage. (5) The preceding provisions of this section apply to a sale by a person who in the course of a business is acting as agent for another as they apply to a sale by a principal in the course of a business, except where that other is not selling in the course of a business and either the buyer knows that fact or reasonable steps are taken to bring it to the notice of the buyer before the contract is made. [ F4 (6) As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the terms implied by subsections (2) and (3) above are conditions. ] (7) Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 below applies in relation to a contract made on or after 18 May 1973 and before the appointed day, and paragraph 6 in relation to one made before 18 May 1973. (8) In subsection (7) above and paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 below references to the appointed day are to the day appointed for the purposes of those provisions by an order of the Secretary of State made by statutory instrument. [ F5 (9) This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in sections 9, 10 and 18 of that Act). ] Textual Amendments F1 Words in s. 14(1)(3)(4) substituted (3.1.1995) by 1994 c. 35 , ss. 7(1) , 8(2) , Sch. 2 para. 5(5)(a) (with s. 8(3) ).

Following the expiry of this period, the non-breaching party may execute any rights it may have both in law and under this agreement.",
        "explanation": "Reducing the breach rectification period to 7 days may be considered unreasonably short, especially for complex breaches, and may contradict the principle of 'reasonable time' as interpreted by English courts in contract law.",

        "law_explanation": "While there's no specific statute dictating a fixed time for breach rectification in all cases, English contract law implies a term of 'reasonableness.' A court might find 7 days insufficient for rectifying certain types of breaches, thereby rendering the clause unenforceable or subject to judicial modification.

        "law_explanation": "English law disfavors agreements that unduly restrict a party's freedom to trade. While this agreement isn't a typical restraint of trade clause, the extended renewal period and shortened notice period create a significant restriction on the Manufacturer's ability to deal with other parties. A court might find this unreasonable and unenforceable, especially if it creates a significant imbalance of power between the parties.

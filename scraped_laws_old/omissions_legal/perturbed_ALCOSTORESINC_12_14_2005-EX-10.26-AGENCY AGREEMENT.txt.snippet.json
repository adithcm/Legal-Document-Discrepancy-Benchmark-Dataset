        "original_text": "Lessor hereby appoints the Company, and the Company hereby agrees to accept such appointment, as the agent of Lessor, without any fee for acting as such agent, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for the purpose of ordering and, subject to the conditions set forth in Section's 2.01 and 2.05 hereof, accepting Equipment on Lessor's behalf for leasing to the Company under the Lease from the respective supplier thereof (each a \"Supplier\" and collectively, the \"Suppliers\"). It is specifically agreed that all of the power and authority vested to the Company herein shall be subject to any modifications as may from time to time be made by Lessor.",

It is specifically agreed that all of the power and authority vested to the Company herein shall be subject to any modifications as may from time to time be made by Lessor.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'without any fee' to 'with a fee to be determined later' could violate state laws regarding transparency and fairness in agency agreements. Many states require that compensation arrangements be clearly defined to protect the principal (Lessor) from hidden costs or conflicts of interest.",

A principal-agent relationship is created when the agent is given authority to act on behalf of the principal. An agreement made by an agent is binding on the principal so long as the agreement was within the authority actually granted to the agent or reasonably perceived by a third party . The two forms of actual authority include: Express authority : An agent has express authority to take any actions requested by the principal as well as authority to take any actions inherently necessary to accomplish those requests. Implied authority : An agent has implied authority to take any action the principal’s conduct indicates the agent should do. Furthermore, failure by the principal to object to an agent’s prior actions may create implied authority to repeat those actions in the future. An agent does not have implied authority to do anything expressly prohibited by the principal. In addition to actual authority, a principal may be bound by the actions of an agent if apparent authority existed. Apparent authority : An agent has apparent authority when, despite no existing authority, a third party reasonably infers that someone is authorized to act on the principal’s behalf due to the conduct of the principal. Unlike actual authority, a principal can be bound by an agent’s act made with apparent authority even if they explicitly stated that the agent could not do that act. Furthermore, a person possessing a widely recognized title like Hiring Director has apparent authority to accomplish anything a reasonable person would believe that title entails. An agent acting with apparent authority is known as an ostensible agent . Additionally, principals can be held liable for the torts of their agents under the doctrine of vicarious liability . A principal is always liable for torts committed while the agent completes their official responsibilities. For torts occurring outside of official duties , the liability of the principal depends on whether the agent’s tort occurred during a frolic or a detour. A principal is liable for the “detours” of their agent but not for the “frolics.” The primary considerations many courts use to determine if an act was a frolic or a detour include how much control the principal exerts over the agent’s actions and who economically benefits from the agent’s actions.

        "explanation": "Removing 'full and accurate' and the right of inspection restricts Lessor's ability to audit the agent's (Company's) activities.

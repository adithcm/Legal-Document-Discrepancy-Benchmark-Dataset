This includes without limitation laws relating to business practice, workplace relations, safety and taxation.",
        "changed_text": "3.1 Compliance with Local Laws and Regulations The Manufacturer covenants that it will endeavor to comply with Local Laws and Regulations where commercially reasonable. This includes laws relating to business practice, workplace relations, safety and taxation.",
        "explanation": "Changing \"is and will remain in compliance\" to \"will endeavor to comply where commercially reasonable\" weakens the commitment to legal compliance. The Manufacturer is based in Vanuatu. Vanuatu's employment act states the employer should maintain a safe and healthy working environment.",

        "law_explanation": "This modification contradicts Vanuatu Labour Law [CAP 160], Part 3 s.36 which requires all businesses to ensure a safe workplace. By stating it will comply only when commercially reasonable, it potentially violates this law.",

Products not rejected within the foregoing time periods shall be deemed accepted by the Customer. In the event that the Manufacturer determines that the returned Product is defective and properly rejected by the Customer, the Manufacturer shall credit to the Customer the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs.",

Products not rejected within fourteen (14) days shall be deemed accepted by the Customer. In the event that the Manufacturer determines that the returned Product is defective, the Manufacturer may, at its sole discretion, offer a credit to the Customer.",
        "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for the Customer to notify the Manufacturer within 7 days of rejecting a product as defective, which weakens the manufacturer's obligation to confirm or deny the customer's claim. It also gives sole discretion to the manufacturer, violating laws that require manufacturers to refund customers. This applies to any jurisdiction but has been specified in relation to Hong Kong.",

ARBITRATION 8.1 Any and all disputes, claims or differences arising out of or relating to this agreement or the alleged breach thereto shall be settled by mutual consultation between the parties in good faith as promptly as possible but failing such amicable settlement, shall be decided by Arbitration by the Arbitration Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce located in Switzerland.",

        "law_explanation": "Section 45, which touches upon judicial involvement in arbitration, can be deemed as being impacted by clauses that unduly favour one party by restricting access to fair arbitration by specifying terms which are overly detrimental to another party.

E+W+N.I. (1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the court may on the application of a party to arbitral proceedings (upon notice to the other parties) determine any question of law arising in the course of the proceedings which the court is satisfied substantially affects the rights of one or more of the parties. An agreement to dispense with reasons for the tribunal’s award shall be considered an agreement to exclude the court’s jurisdiction under this section. (2) An application under this section shall not be considered unless— (a) it is made with the agreement of all the other parties to the proceedings, or (b) it is made with the permission of the tribunal and the court is satisfied— (i) that the determination of the question is likely to produce substantial savings in costs, and (ii) that the application was made without delay. (3) The application shall identify the question of law to be determined and, unless made with the agreement of all the other parties to the proceedings, shall state the grounds on which it is said that the question should be decided by the court. (4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award while an application to the court under this section is pending. (5) Unless the court gives leave, no appeal lies from a decision of the court whether the conditions specified in subsection (2) are met. (6) The decision of the court on the question of law shall be treated as a judgment of the court for the purposes of an appeal. But no appeal lies without the leave of the court which shall not be given unless the court considers that the question is one of general importance, or is one which for some other special reason should be considered by the Court of Appeal.

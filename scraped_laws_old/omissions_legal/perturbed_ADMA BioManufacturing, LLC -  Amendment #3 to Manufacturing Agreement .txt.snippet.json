        "original_text": "At such time that the Source Plasma is delivered to the ADMA loading dock located at 5800 Park of Commerce Blvd NW, Boca Raton, FL 33487, risk of loss for such delivered Source Plasma shall, as between Sanofi Pasteur and ADMA, transfer to ADMA. ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property and shall reimburse Sanofi Pasteur, at the dollar value, the Source Plasma in case of damage or loss.",
        "changed_text": "At such time that the Source Plasma is delivered to the ADMA loading dock located at 5800 Park of Commerce Blvd NW, Boca Raton, FL 33487, risk of loss for such delivered Source Plasma shall, as between Sanofi Pasteur and ADMA, transfer to ADMA.",
        "explanation": "By removing the statement that ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss and reimburse Sanofi Pasteur for damaged or lost Source Plasma, the contract shifts the risk of loss to Sanofi Pasteur without their explicit agreement. This could violate general principles of bailment and commercial law, where the party in possession (ADMA) typically bears the risk of loss unless otherwise agreed. This is especially pertinent under Florida law concerning commercial transactions.",

        "law_explanation": "Florida Statutes Chapter 672.319 covers the F.O.B and F.A.S terms. It states that unless otherwise explicitly agreed, the risk of loss passes to the buyer (ADMA) when the goods are duly delivered at the F.O.B location. By omitting ADMA's agreement to assume risk of loss and reimburse, the contract deviates from this default rule without clear alternative provision, potentially violating the buyer's responsibilities under Florida's UCC.",

        "original_text": "In no event shall either party be liable to the other party for incidental, indirect, special and consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation any claims for damages based upon lost profits or lost business opportunity. Except for the obligation of indemnity as set forth in Section 6.1 (c) with respect to claims by third parties for personal injury, illness or death (but not including property damage) resulting from the manufacture of the Product by BPC, aggregate damages for which ADMA shall be liable to Sanofi Pasteur hereunder, including without limitation costs of Source Plasma yield loss and/or rejected Batches, shall not exceed [***]. All claims by Sanofi Pasteur for breach or default under this Agreement shall be brought within [***] year after the cause of action comes into existence or otherwise shall be waived. This limitation of liability will not apply for damages that result from the gross negligence or the willful misconduct of a Party.",

        "explanation": "Removing the last sentence, 'This limitation of liability will not apply for damages that result from the gross negligence or the willful misconduct of a Party,' attempts to shield ADMA from liability even in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is against public policy and may violate Florida law, which generally does not allow parties to contract away liability for such egregious conduct, especially when it involves manufacturing pharmaceuticals.",
        "contradicted_law": "Florida law regarding exculpatory clauses and limitations of liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

        "law_explanation": "Florida law generally disfavors exculpatory clauses that attempt to relieve a party of liability for its own negligence, and it strictly construes such clauses against the party seeking to be relieved of liability. Furthermore, Florida courts have held that a party cannot contract away liability for its own gross negligence or intentional misconduct, as such agreements are void as against public policy. By removing the exception for gross negligence and willful misconduct, this provision attempts to do exactly that, potentially rendering the limitation of liability unenforceable under Florida law.",

        "changed_text": "ADMA accepts and declares that the amount of the liquidated damages is a fair and equitable compensation for such failure in reaching the volume commitment within the timelines agreed herein.",
        "explanation": "By omitting 'and not a penalty, for such failure in reaching the volume commitment within the timelines agreed herein and in regard to the value and use of the Source Plasma', this attempts to weaken ADMA's acknowledgement. Without this, the contract could be challenged on the basis that the liquidated damages are actually a penalty and therefore unenforceable. This is against Florida law, which requires a showing that liquidated damages are not a penalty to be enforceable.",

        "law_url": "https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1991/76661-0.html",
        "law_explanation": "Florida law, as established in Lefemine v. Baron, provides that a liquidated damages clause is only enforceable if (1) the damages consequent upon a breach are not readily ascertainable and (2) the sum stipulated to be forfeited constitutes a reasonable forecast of provable damages resulting from breach. The omission weakens the explicit declaration that it is not a penalty and a fair compensation, which might be used as basis to challenge the enforceability of that clause under Florida Law.",

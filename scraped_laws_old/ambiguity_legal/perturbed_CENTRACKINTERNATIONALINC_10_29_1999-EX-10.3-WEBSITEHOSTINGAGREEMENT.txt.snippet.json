        "explanation": "The terms 'endeavor to maintain' and 'considers necessary' introduce ambiguity and discretion, weakening the obligation to provide continuous service. The original clause mandated continuous operation except for 'reasonable' maintenance, a standard generally understood. This change makes uptime discretionary and subjective.",

        "law_explanation": "By significantly weakening the guarantee of continuous service through vague language like 'endeavor' and granting itself broad discretion over maintenance ('considers necessary'), i-on is arguably engaging in a deceptive practice if the service uptime is drastically reduced without clear and conspicuous disclosure. FDUTPA prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce. The changes introduce an ambiguity that could mislead customers regarding the reliability of the service.",

        "explanation": "This modification removes the objective standard of 'proper environmental conditions' and 'reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access,' replacing it with vague assurances.

        "law_explanation": "While this agreement predates the Act, it's prudent to consider. The original clause had an element of control for physical access, where the new wording removes this control. The FIPA requires businesses to take reasonable measures to protect sensitive personal information. By reducing the obligation to simply 'efforts will be made,' without defining what constitutes those efforts, i-on potentially fails to meet the 'reasonable measures' standard if a data breach occurs due to inadequate physical security.

An individual’s first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements for that individual: (I) A social security number; (II) A driver license or identification card number, passport number, military identification number, or other similar number issued on a government document used to verify identity; (III) A financial account number or credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that is necessary to permit access to an individual’s financial account; (IV) Any information regarding an individual’s medical history, mental or physical condition, or medical treatment or diagnosis by a health care professional; (V) An individual’s health insurance policy number or subscriber identification number and any unique identifier used by a health insurer to identify the individual; (VI) An individual’s biometric data as defined in s. 501.702 ; or (VII) Any information regarding an individual’s geolocation. b. A user name or e-mail address, in combination with a password or security question and answer that would permit access to an online account. 2. The term does not include information about an individual that has been made publicly available by a federal, state, or local governmental entity.

(2) REQUIREMENTS FOR DATA SECURITY. — Each covered entity, governmental entity, or third-party agent shall take reasonable measures to protect and secure data in electronic form containing personal information. (3) NOTICE TO DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY BREACH. — (a) A covered entity shall provide notice to the department of any breach of security affecting 500 or more individuals in this state. Such notice must be provided to the department as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than 30 days after the determination of the breach or reason to believe a breach occurred. A covered entity may receive 15 additional days to provide notice as required in subsection (4) if good cause for delay is provided in writing to the department within 30 days after determination of the breach or reason to believe a breach occurred. (b) The written notice to the department must include: 1. A synopsis of the events surrounding the breach at the time notice is provided. 2. The number of individuals in this state who were or potentially have been affected by the breach. 3. Any services related to the breach being offered or scheduled to be offered, without charge, by the covered entity to individuals, and instructions as to how to use such services. 4. A copy of the notice required under subsection (4) or an explanation of the other actions taken pursuant to subsection (4). 5.

(4) NOTICE TO INDIVIDUALS OF SECURITY BREACH. — (a) A covered entity shall give notice to each individual in this state whose personal information was, or the covered entity reasonably believes to have been, accessed as a result of the breach. Notice to individuals shall be made as expeditiously as practicable and without unreasonable delay, taking into account the time necessary to allow the covered entity to determine the scope of the breach of security, to identify individuals affected by the breach, and to restore the reasonable integrity of the data system that was breached, but no later than 30 days after the determination of a breach or reason to believe a breach occurred unless subject to a delay authorized under paragraph (b) or waiver under paragraph (c). (b) If a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency determines that notice to individuals required under this subsection would interfere with a criminal investigation, the notice shall be delayed upon the written request of the law enforcement agency for a specified period that the law enforcement agency determines is reasonably necessary. A law enforcement agency may, by a subsequent written request, revoke such delay as of a specified date or extend the period set forth in the original request made under this paragraph to a specified date if further delay is necessary. (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), notice to the affected individuals is not required if, after an appropriate investigation and consultation with relevant federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies, the covered entity reasonably determines that the breach has not and will not likely result in identity theft or any other financial harm to the individuals whose personal information has been accessed. Such a determination must be documented in writing and maintained for at least 5 years. The covered entity shall provide the written determination to the department within 30 days after the determination. (d) The notice to an affected individual shall be by one of the following methods: 1. Written notice sent to the mailing address of the individual in the records of the covered entity; or 2.

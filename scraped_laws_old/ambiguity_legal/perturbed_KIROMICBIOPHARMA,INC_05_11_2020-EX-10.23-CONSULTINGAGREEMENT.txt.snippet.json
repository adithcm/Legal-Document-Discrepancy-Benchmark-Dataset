        "original_text": "Consultant shall not, during or subsequent to the term of this Agreement, use any Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than the performance of the Services on behalf of Company, or disclose Confidential Information to any third party. Consultant agrees that Confidential Information shall remain the sole property of Company. Consultant further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information.",

Consultant agrees that Confidential Information should remain the sole property of Company where feasible. Consultant further agrees to consider taking precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information.",
        "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing definitive obligations like 'shall not' with weaker, less enforceable terms such as 'shall endeavor not to' and 'unless reasonably necessary'. Similarly, 'should remain' and 'consider taking precautions' introduce a level of discretion and uncertainty that weakens the original obligation to protect confidential information. The additions of 'where feasible' and 'unless reasonably necessary' introduce potential loopholes.",

        "law_explanation": "TUTSA provides specific legal recourse for misappropriation of trade secrets, requiring a duty to maintain confidentiality. By weakening the obligation to protect confidential information with ambiguous terms, the modified text could hinder the company's ability to enforce its rights under TUTSA, as it creates room for arguments that the consultant 'endeavored' to protect the information or that disclosure was 'reasonably necessary'. The original language imposes a clearer, stricter standard of confidentiality.",

        "original_text": "Consultant agrees to sign, execute and acknowledge or cause to be signed, executed and acknowledged without cost, but at the expense of Company, any and all documents and to perform such acts as my be necessary, useful or convenient for the purposes of perfecting the foregoing assignments and obtaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights in any and all countries with respect to Inventions.",
        "changed_text": "Consultant agrees to consider signing, executing, and acknowledging documents, where reasonably practical, and to contemplate performing acts that might be helpful for perfecting assignments and obtaining intellectual property rights in certain countries with respect to Inventions, subject to Consultant's reasonable availability.",
        "explanation": "This modification introduces significant ambiguity and weakens the consultant's obligation to assist with intellectual property protection. Replacing 'agrees to sign, execute and acknowledge' with 'agrees to consider signing' makes the action discretionary. Adding 'where reasonably practical' and 'might be helpful' further dilutes the obligation. Limiting the scope to 'certain countries' reduces the geographical coverage, and the phrase 'subject to Consultant's reasonable availability' gives the consultant an easy way to avoid fulfilling the obligation. This contradicts the original intent of securing intellectual property rights.",

        "law_explanation": "The United States Patent Act (35 U.S. Code § 261) addresses the assignment of patent rights. The original language ensures the consultant is obligated to take necessary steps to assist in securing these rights for the company. The modified language introduces ambiguity that might allow the consultant to avoid assisting in securing those rights, potentially jeopardizing the company's ability to obtain and enforce patents on inventions.",

        "original_text": "Company shall be obliged to pay, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Consultant's final statement, all amounts owing to Consultant for unpaid Services completed by Consultant and related expenses, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof, and Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.",
        "changed_text": "Company may endeavor to pay, within a reasonable time after receipt of Consultant's final statement, amounts Consultant claims are owing for services Consultant asserts were completed and related expenses, if applicable, as Company understands the provisions of Section 1. Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 might survive termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This change replaces firm obligations with discretionary language. 'Shall be obliged to pay' is replaced with 'may endeavor to pay,' making payment non-mandatory. 'Within thirty (30) days' is replaced with 'within a reasonable time,' introducing subjectivity. The phrase 'amounts Consultant claims are owing' and 'services Consultant asserts were completed' suggests doubt about the validity of the consultant's claims. Finally, 'might survive termination' creates uncertainty about which clauses remain in effect after termination.",

        "law_explanation": "The Texas Prompt Payment Act (Texas Business and Commerce Code Chapter 28) mandates specific timelines for payments to contractors and subcontractors. By replacing 'shall be obliged to pay within thirty (30) days' with ambiguous terms, the company could violate this Act, which requires adherence to a specific timeframe. The modified clause introduces uncertainty about the payment timeline, making it difficult to enforce timely payments under the law.",

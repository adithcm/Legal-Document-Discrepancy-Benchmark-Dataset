        "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
        "original_text": "The Company will pay any stock issue and transfer taxes which may be payable with respect to the sale of the Securities.",
        "changed_text": "In recognition of the Agent's efforts, the Company will pay any stock issue and transfer taxes which may be payable with respect to the sale of the Securities.",
        "explanation": "The payment of stock issue and transfer taxes is a legal obligation, adding 'In recognition of the Agent's efforts' creates ambiguity and could be misconstrued as a conditional payment, weakening the enforceability of this obligation.",
        "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania imposes a Realty Transfer Tax on certain real estate transfers.",
        "law_citation": "72 P.S. ยง 8102-C",
        "law_url": "https://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/dvdmv/dmv/dl/fact_sheets/fs-rtt.pdf",
        "law_explanation": "This modification introduces an element of conditionality (Agent's efforts) where none should exist according to the law, potentially leading to disputes over whether the tax payment obligation is triggered. Pennsylvania law makes no such condition.",

        "original_text": "During the period ending on the third anniversary of the expiration of the fiscal year during which the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby occurs, the Company will furnish to its stockholders as soon as practicable after the end of each such fiscal year an annual report (including consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows, certified by independent public accountants) and, as soon as practicable after the end of each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal quarter ending after the effective date of the Registration Statement), the Company will make available to its stockholders consolidated summary financial information of the Company and the Bank for such quarter in reasonable detail.",
        "changed_text": "In an effort to reduce operational costs, the Company may, at its discretion, furnish to its stockholders annually, reports of financial standing.",
        "explanation": "This change replaces a clear obligation to provide annual and quarterly reports with a discretionary statement. This undermines transparency and accountability to stockholders.",
        "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934",
        "law_citation": "15 U.S. Code ยง 78m",
        "law_url": "https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf",
        "law_explanation": "The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires publicly traded companies to file periodic reports (including annual and quarterly reports) with the SEC, ensuring transparency and providing investors with regular financial information. The modified text contradicts this requirement by making the provision of financial reports discretionary, potentially depriving stockholders of essential information and violating SEC regulations.",

        "original_text": "The Company authorizes Sandler O'Neill and any Selected Dealer to act as agent of the Company in distributing the Prospectus to persons entitled to receive subscription rights and other persons to be offered Securities having record addresses in the states or jurisdictions set forth in a survey of the securities or \"blue sky\" laws of the various jurisdictions in which the Offerings will be made (the \"Blue Sky Survey\").",
        "changed_text": "For marketing purposes only, the Company authorizes Sandler O'Neill and any Selected Dealer to act as agent of the Company in distributing the Prospectus to persons entitled to receive subscription rights and other persons to be offered Securities having record addresses in the states or jurisdictions set forth in a survey of the securities or \"blue sky\" laws of the various jurisdictions in which the Offerings will be made (the \"Blue Sky Survey\").",
        "explanation": "Adding 'For marketing purposes only' minimizes the legal weight of this authorization. Distributing the prospectus is not merely a marketing activity; it's a legal requirement for offering securities.",

        "law_citation": "15 U.S.C. ยง 77e",
        "law_url": "https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf",
        "law_explanation": "Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 prohibits the offer or sale of securities without a registration statement and requires that a prospectus be delivered to investors. The added phrase undermines the legal necessity of prospectus distribution, making it seem like an optional marketing activity, which is a misrepresentation of the law.",

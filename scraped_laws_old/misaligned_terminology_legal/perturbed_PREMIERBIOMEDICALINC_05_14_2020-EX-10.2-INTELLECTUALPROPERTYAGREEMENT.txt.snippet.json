        "original_text": "Applications. Defines as all applications of the United States and foreign countries, including Patent Cooperation Treaty applications that claim priority to the Applications listed in Appendix A, including any non-provisional applications, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, reissues, re-examinations or extensions thereof; and all applications including those applications filed in the United States or applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty on subject matter directly related to the Applications in Appendix A whether or not priority to said applications was claimed.",
        "changed_text": "Applications. Defines as all requests submitted to any governmental authority, domestic or foreign, whether or not they claim priority to the Applications listed in Appendix A, including any provisional applications, full applications, and petitions to agencies; and all requests including those submitted in the United States or under international treaty on subject matter remotely connected to the Applications in Appendix A regardless of whether priority to said applications was claimed.",
        "explanation": "The modification broadens the definition of 'Applications' beyond its typically understood legal and patent context. By including 'petitions to agencies' and broadly defining related subject matter, the term loses its specific meaning under patent law. This creates uncertainty regarding which filings are actually covered, making enforcement more difficult. 'Remotely connected' is not a standard legal phrase and is overly broad.",

        "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/patentable_subject_matter",
        "law_explanation": "The US Patent Act defines what constitutes patentable subject matter, focusing on inventions and discoveries. The altered definition in the contract dilutes this by including any 'requests' to agencies, regardless of whether they relate to a patentable invention, creating a conflict with the Act's focus on specific, defined categories of patentable subject matter and leading to legal ambiguity.",

        "original_text": "Confidential information shall also mean any information not generally made available or known to the public and shall include, without limitation, all ideas, inventions, software, documentation, flowcharts, diagrams, improvements, discoveries, research and development, know how, formulas, compositions, manufacturing and production processes and techniques, technical data, designs, drawings, plans, specifications, and all other information or material within the definition of a \"trade secret\" as set forth in the Uniform Trade Secret Act, or which either party otherwise reasonably considers proprietary.",
        "changed_text": "Confidential information shall also mean any information not generally made available or known to the public but can include previously published material; shall include, without limitation, all suggestions, notions, software, records, sketches, visual aids, advancements, findings, studies and growth, understanding, methods, structures, production events and approaches, factual details, models, pictures, layouts, arrangements, requirements, and all other information or material regardless of whether it would be considered a \"trade secret\" under the Uniform Trade Secret Act, and everything either party finds to be advantageous to them.",
        "explanation": "The altered definition of 'Confidential Information' significantly expands its scope to include even 'previously published material' and discards the requirement that information meet the definition of a 'trade secret' under the Uniform Trade Secret Act. This contradicts established legal protections for trade secrets, which require that information be secret and provide a competitive advantage. By encompassing anything a party finds 'advantageous,' it becomes overly broad and unenforceable.",

        "law_citation": "UTSA § 1(4)",
        "law_url": "https://www.uniformlaws.org/acts/utsa",
        "law_explanation": "The UTSA defines a 'trade secret' as information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable, and is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. The modified contract contradicts this by including 'previously published material' and removing the requirement for secrecy, thus undermining the core principles of trade secret protection as defined by the UTSA.",

        "original_text": "\"Selling price\" shall exclude: usual trade discounts actually allowed to unaffiliated persons or entities such as packing costs, costs of transportation and transportation insurance, and import, export, excise, sales and value added taxes, and custom duties.",
        "changed_text": "\"Selling price\" may exclude: discounts offered at the seller's discretion and any costs they deem appropriate, including but not limited to internal overhead, marketing costs, and projected future expenses.",
        "explanation": "The original text provides a clear, objective definition of exclusions from 'selling price.' The modification introduces subjectivity and broadens the exclusions to include 'internal overhead' and 'projected future expenses,' contradicting standard accounting practices and potentially violating revenue recognition principles. This creates ambiguity and allows for manipulation of the selling price, affecting royalty calculations.",

        "law_url": "https://www.fasb.org/summary/asc606.shtml",
        "law_explanation": "ASC 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) under GAAP provides guidelines for recognizing revenue, which includes defining the transaction price and allocating it to performance obligations. The modified contract's definition of 'selling price,' allowing for exclusions like 'internal overhead' and 'projected future expenses,' contradicts GAAP by potentially understating the transaction price and misrepresenting revenue, which is not an acceptable way to conduct business practices. The modification leads to uncertainty and possible misreporting of financial data.",

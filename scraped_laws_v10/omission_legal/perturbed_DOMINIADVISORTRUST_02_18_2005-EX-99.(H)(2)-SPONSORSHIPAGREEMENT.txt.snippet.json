        "explanation": "This change removes the explicit responsibility to file *all* documents required for compliance, and replaces 'all documents' with 'some documents.' It also removes the reference to specific required filings (e.g. N-1A, prospectuses) and regulations like 'blue sky' laws.

Removing the phrase 'but not limited to' reduces the scope of expenses covered, and the removal of all the items that come after that phrase such as SEC fees, blue sky fees, and custodian fees omits critical obligations required by law.

        "original_text": "Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.",
        "changed_text": "Should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract, the Buyers may attempt to negotiate with the Sellers for a resolution.",
        "explanation": "The original text provides a clear right for the buyer to claim replacement or compensation for non-conforming goods, supported by an inspection certificate from the China Commodity Inspection Bureau. This is a standard practice reflecting obligations under international sale of goods conventions. The modified text removes the buyer's explicit right to claim replacement or compensation, replacing it with a vague suggestion of negotiation.  This undermines the buyer's legal protection in case of defective goods.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 39 of the CISG requires the buyer to notify the seller of non-conformity of goods within a reasonable time after discovery, or lose the right to rely on the non-conformity. By removing the buyer's explicit right to claim replacement or compensation and replacing it with a vague negotiation clause, the modified text effectively undermines the buyer's ability to exercise their rights under CISG Article 39, which the contract defaults to in section 21, 'Law Application'.",

In case the goods are to be dispatched by parcel post/sea-freight, the Sellers shall, 3 days before the time of delivery, inform the Buyers by cable/letter of the estimated date of delivery, Contract No., commodity, invoiced value, etc. The sellers shall, immediately after dispatch of the goods, advise the Buyers by cable/letter of the Contract No., commodity, invoiced value and date of dispatch for the Buyers.",
        "changed_text": "The Sellers shall ship the goods. Transshipment is allowed. Partial Shipment is allowed.",
        "explanation": "The original text obligates the seller to provide timely shipping notifications (3 days before and immediately after dispatch). Removing these requirements disadvantages the buyer by preventing them from arranging timely import procedures and inspections upon arrival in China, and potentially violates notification standards expected by trade regulations. The contract specifies Shenzhen, Guangdong, China as the port of destination, making Chinese import laws relevant.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 13 specifies the information required on import and export declaration forms, including details on the goods, value, and shipping information. The lack of prior notification hinders the buyer's ability to accurately prepare these declarations, potentially leading to delays and penalties, and implicitly contradicts the standards expected by Chinese customs regulations for timely and accurate import declarations. Removing the notification requirements hinders compliance with Chinese customs regulations.",

Under such circumstances the Sellers, however, are still under the obligation to take all necessary measures to hasten the delivery of the goods. In case the accident lasts for more than 10 weeks, the Buyers shall have the right to cancel the Contract.",
        "changed_text": "The Sellers may advise the Buyers of the occurrence mentioned above. In case the accident lasts for more than 10 weeks, the Buyers shall have the right to cancel the Contract.",
        "explanation": "The original text mandates the seller to provide immediate notice and subsequent documented proof (via certificate from a government authority, Chamber of Commerce, or notary) of a force majeure event. It also places an obligation on the seller to mitigate the effects of the force majeure by hastening delivery. The modified version weakens this clause by making the notification optional ('may' instead of 'shall') and removing the requirement for documented proof of the force majeure event. This puts the buyer at a disadvantage because they cannot easily verify the legitimacy of the force majeure claim and have no assurance the seller is taking steps to reduce the impact of the delay.",

        "law_explanation": "CISG Article 79 provides an exemption from liability for a party's failure to perform due to an impediment beyond their control. However, the party relying on this exemption must prove the impediment and its effect on their ability to perform. By removing the mandatory notification and certification requirements for force majeure events, the modified text makes it harder for the buyer to challenge the seller's claim of force majeure under CISG Article 79, giving the seller an unfair advantage and undermining the buyer's rights.",

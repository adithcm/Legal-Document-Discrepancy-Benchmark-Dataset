Commercial General Liability Insurance. Occurrence based coverage with a combined single limit of at least $10,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate for premises and operations; products and completed operations; contractual liability coverage for indemnities of a Party contained within this Agreement; broad form property damage (including completed operations); explosion, collapse and underground hazards; and personal injury. Requires additional insured endorsement and waiver of subrogation endorsement.",

        "explanation": "By removing the specific requirement to maintain minimum insurance coverage, the modified text contradicts general business and contractual norms and potentially applicable state laws requiring reasonable risk management and coverage for liabilities. This omission creates a legal loophole and exposes the parties to significant financial risks in case of accidents or damages.",

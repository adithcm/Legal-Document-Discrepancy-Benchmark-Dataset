By making the execution of assignments discretionary, the modified text could be interpreted as allowing the parties to choose not to execute necessary assignments, which undermines the corporation's legal power to properly transfer intellectual property assets as required to effectuate the spin-off, potentially hindering the entire agreement. The original text ensures a valid transfer while the new one suggests that the parties may optionally decide to not fulfill their duties.",

Board of directors; powers; number, qualifications, terms and quorum; committees; classes of directors; nonstock corporations; reliance upon books; action without meeting; removal. (a) The business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation. If any such provision is made in the certificate of incorporation, the powers and duties conferred or imposed upon the board of directors by this chapter shall be exercised or performed to such extent and by such person or persons as shall be provided in the certificate of incorporation. (b) The board of directors of a corporation shall consist of 1 or more members, each of whom shall be a natural person. The number of directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the bylaws, unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors, in which case a change in the number of directors shall be made only by amendment of the certificate. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws. The certificate of incorporation or bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. Each director shall hold office until such directorâs successor is elected and qualified or until such directorâs earlier resignation or removal. Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the corporation. A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events.

The original clause aims to prevent any action that could impair SpinCo's trademarks. By weakening the language to only prohibit actions that 'significantly' oppose or threaten SpinCo's IP, and introducing caveats like 'attempt to not,' the modified text creates ambiguity and potentially allows for actions that, while not overtly infringing, could still cause confusion or dilute SpinCo's trademark, conflicting with the Lanham Act's intent to protect trademark holders from any form of infringement that leads to consumer deception or confusion.",

        "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use reasonable best efforts' with 'will consider using reasonable efforts' weakens the obligation to a mere consideration. Replacing 'take' with 'try to take' and 'cause to be taken' with 'potentially cause to be taken' introduces uncertainty. Replacing 'all actions' with 'some actions' and 'all things' with 'a few things' reduces the scope of the obligation. Using 'seemingly necessary' instead of 'reasonably necessary' and 'possibly proper' instead of 'proper' makes the criteria subjective. Limiting 'applicable Laws and agreements' to 'select Laws and agreements' introduces a loophole.

By using qualifiers like 'potentially,' 'perhaps,' 'seemingly,' 'select,' and weakening the 'shall use reasonable best efforts' to 'will consider using reasonable efforts,' the modified text introduces ambiguity and suggests a lower level of commitment than required by law for the successful completion of the spin-off process and to effectively protect intellectual property rights assigned in connection with it.

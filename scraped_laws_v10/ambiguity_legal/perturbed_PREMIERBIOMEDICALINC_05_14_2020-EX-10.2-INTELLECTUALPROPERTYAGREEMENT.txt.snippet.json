        "original_text": "Each Party agrees to hold in confidence confidential information acquired in the course of this relationship with the other Parties and their associates. Each Party agrees to refrain from, either during period of this Agreement or at any other time thereafter, disclosing, using or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement.",
        "changed_text": "Each Party will endeavor to hold in confidence confidential information acquired during this relationship. Each Party will try to refrain from disclosing confidential information, acquired during this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The terms 'agrees to hold in confidence' and 'agrees to refrain from' are replaced with 'will endeavor to hold in confidence' and 'will try to refrain from', weakening the obligation to maintain confidentiality. This introduces ambiguity as 'endeavor' and 'try' suggest effort rather than a strict requirement, potentially allowing parties to disclose confidential information if they deem it necessary.",

        ],
        "law_explanation": "PUTSA, as adopted in Pennsylvania, provides legal remedies for the misappropriation of trade secrets. By weakening the confidentiality obligation, the modified text makes it more difficult to prove misappropriation, as the duty to protect confidential information is no longer strictly defined, potentially conflicting with the statute's intent to protect trade secrets.",

        "changed_text": "Venue for any action related to this Agreement may preferably be in a court located in Mercer County, Pennsylvania.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'shall be' to 'may preferably be' introduces ambiguity regarding the mandatory nature of the venue. The original text clearly dictates that any legal action must occur in Mercer County, PA. The modified text suggests a preference, but does not explicitly require it, potentially allowing lawsuits to be filed elsewhere.",

        "law_explanation": "Pa.R.C.P. 1006 outlines the rules for venue in Pennsylvania. While parties can agree to a specific venue, the modified text's ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether the agreement is enforceable, conflicting with the principle of contractual certainty and potentially leading to litigation outside the agreed-upon jurisdiction if a court finds the clause non-binding.",

        "original_text": "THI shall prepay Marv for any affirmed IP Cost before payment is to be made by Marv. Marv shall have no duty to pay an IP Cost, whether affirmed or not affirmed, for which Marv does not receive prepayment.",
        "changed_text": "THI should prepay Marv for affirmed IP Costs when feasible before Marv makes the payment. Marv will generally not be expected to pay an IP Cost if Marv does not receive prepayment.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should when feasible' and 'shall have no duty' to 'will generally not be expected' introduces ambiguity. 'Should when feasible' makes prepayment discretionary and subject to interpretation, while 'generally not be expected' does not entirely remove Marv's obligation to pay. This ambiguity weakens the financial obligations of THI and creates potential disputes over IP cost payments.",

        "law_explanation": "Pennsylvania contract law requires clear and definite terms for an agreement to be enforceable. The introduction of ambiguity regarding prepayment of IP costs could render this section of the contract unenforceable, because the terms are not clear, creating uncertainty and hindering the enforcement of the contractual obligation to reimburse Marv for IP costs. This uncertainty undermines the foundational principles of contract law in Pennsylvania.",

        "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT: A.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude, B.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community, D.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT.",
        "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will endeavor to conduct himself with general regard to public sentiment. If, in ADAMS GOLF's estimation, CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is somewhat diminished because CONSULTANT: A.may have committed a questionable act, B.possibly violates an applicable law, C.engages in behavior that might be perceived negatively, D.makes statements that could be considered unfavorable to ADAMS GOLF, then ADAMS GOLF may consider taking action, at its discretion, after providing informal notice to CONSULTANT.",
        "explanation": "The original clause provides clear grounds for termination based on specific, objectively verifiable actions. The modified clause replaces these with vague, subjective criteria ('general regard,' 'somewhat diminished,' 'questionable act,' 'might be perceived negatively,' 'could be considered unfavorable'). It also makes the termination process discretionary ('may consider taking action') and replaces formal written notice with 'informal notice.' This makes enforcement uncertain and potentially contradicts the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in Kansas contracts.",

        "law_explanation": "Kansas law, like most states, implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. This means that parties must act honestly and reasonably in exercising their contractual rights. The modified clause allows ADAMS GOLF to terminate the agreement based on subjective and vague reasons, potentially violating this duty if exercised arbitrarily or in bad faith. The statute itself doesn't explicitly define good faith in contractual terms, but case law interprets it as requiring honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. The changes create a situation where termination could be justified on flimsy or pretextual grounds, contradicting this implied duty.",

        "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall use best efforts to cooperate with ADAMS GOLF in giving advice, suggestions and recommendations concerning the acceptability and playability of current ADAMS GOLF lines, the development of new ADAMS GOLF lines, and information about significant golf PRODUCT and golf market trends, and meet as reasonably requested with ADAMS GOLF'S Design/Testing Teams.",
        "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT should, when convenient, offer occasional input regarding ADAMS GOLF products if he feels so inclined.",
        "explanation": "The original clause requires 'best efforts' from the consultant to provide advice and meet with design teams. The revised text significantly weakens this obligation, making it optional ('should, when convenient') and dependent on the consultant's feelings ('if he feels so inclined'). This introduces ambiguity and discretionary power, making the consultant's obligation virtually unenforceable.",

        ],
        "law_explanation": "Kansas law recognizes a cause of action for breach of contract when a party fails to perform their contractual obligations. While 'best efforts' is a defined standard, 'should, when convenient, offer occasional input if he feels so inclined' provides no definite obligation and makes it nearly impossible for ADAMS GOLF to prove a breach. This contradicts the principle that contracts should create clear, enforceable obligations.",

        "changed_text": "Every notice which may be served upon ADAMS GOLF, according to the terms of this Agreement, may be delivered through reasonable means to their corporate headquarters.",
        "explanation": "The original clause specifies a precise method and address for serving written notices to ADAMS GOLF. The modified clause replaces this with vague language ('reasonable means,' 'corporate headquarters'). This creates uncertainty about what constitutes proper notice, potentially leading to disputes over whether notice was effectively given. While the address of the headquarters can be found, reasonable means can be interpreted subjectively.",

        "law_explanation": "While Kansas law doesn't have a specific statute dictating notice requirements in all contracts, case law emphasizes the importance of adhering to the notice provisions agreed upon by the parties. The revised text's ambiguity regarding 'reasonable means' and 'corporate headquarters' could lead to a court finding that notice was not properly given, thus impacting a party's ability to enforce their rights under the contract. The change shifts the obligation from a precise, easily verifiable act (mailing to a specific address) to a subjective assessment of what constitutes 'reasonable means,' increasing the likelihood of disputes and potentially frustrating the purpose of the notice clause.",

The seller shall be liable for any damage and loss of the commodity, expenses incurred on account of improper packing, and any damage attributable to inadequate or improper protective measures taken by the seller in regard to the packing.",

        "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by removing 'new strong' and 'well protected against rough handling, corrosion, shocks, rust, and freezing,' weakening the packing requirements. Changing 'shall be liable' to 'may be liable' introduces uncertainty about the seller's responsibility for damages due to improper packing. The phrase 'packing deemed improper' introduces subjectivity. This creates ambiguity around what constitutes proper packing and the seller's liability, making enforcement difficult.",

        "explanation": "Changing \"guarantee\" to \"generally endeavor to ensure\" weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity.

        "original_text": "Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.",

        "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities. Replacing \"7 days\" with \"a reasonable time\" makes the claim period vague and subjective. Changing \"be found not in conformity\" to \"appear not in conformity\" lowers the standard of proof required. Removing the specification of the China Commodity Inspection Bureau and adding \"if they obtain an Inspection Certificate\" makes the required inspection process unclear and optional. Replacing \"have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation\" with \"may attempt to claim for compensation\" weakens the buyer's rights. Finally, changing \"all the expenses...shall be borne by the Sellers\" to \"some expenses may be borne by the Sellers\" makes the allocation of expenses uncertain.",

The modified text, by making the timeframe and required inspection optional and weakening the buyer's right to claim, contradicts the spirit and intent of Article 157 by introducing excessive ambiguity and undermining the buyer's ability to enforce their contractual rights.",

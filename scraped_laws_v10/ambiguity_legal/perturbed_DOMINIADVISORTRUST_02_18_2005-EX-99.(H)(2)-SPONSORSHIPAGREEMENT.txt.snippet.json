        "explanation": "The original text clearly states the Sponsor 'shall perform' specific duties. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'endeavor to perform' and 'generally support,' making the Sponsor's commitment less definitive. By adding 'as available' it creates uncertainty regarding the provision of clerical services. This introduces ambiguity regarding the Sponsor's responsibilities, which could be interpreted as conflicting with the implied duties under Massachusetts law regarding fiduciary responsibility.",

By weakening the Sponsor's obligation to provide oversight, administrative, and management services, the modified text creates a scenario where the Sponsor might not be fulfilling its implied fiduciary duties to the Trust in accordance with Massachusetts law. The use of ambiguous language such as 'endeavor to perform' and 'as available' could be interpreted as a failure to act with the required level of care, skill, prudence, and diligence.",

The modified text weakens this obligation by stating the Sponsor is merely 'assisting with the preparation of documents for potential compliance, as deemed necessary' and only reviews tax returns 'on a periodic basis if convenient.'

Company warrants that the Products will be designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled and packaged in a generally acceptable manner and that such Products shall be substantially functional and somewhat fit for their intended purposes. Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be mostly free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user.",
        "explanation": "The terms 'workmanlike manner', 'fully functional and fit for their intended purposes,' and 'free from defects' are replaced with weaker, less precise terms ('generally acceptable manner', 'substantially functional and somewhat fit,' and 'mostly free from defects'). This introduces ambiguity regarding the standard of quality and fitness required, making the warranty less enforceable.",

        "law_explanation": "The original text aligned more closely with the implied warranty of merchantability under UCC ยง 2-314, which requires goods to be 'fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.' The modified text weakens these guarantees, potentially conflicting with the UCC's baseline requirements for merchantability, as 'substantially functional' and 'somewhat fit' might not meet the standard of 'ordinary purposes.' The UCC warranty of merchantability might be interpreted to mean the good 'works', not 'somewhat works'.",

        "changed_text": "The Distributor shall pay Company within thirty (30) days of the approximate expected receipt of Products.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'receipt of Products' to 'approximate expected receipt of Products' introduces ambiguity. The original clause ties the payment trigger to a concrete event (actual receipt). The modified clause uses a subjective and potentially inaccurate estimate, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over payment timing. This can conflict with standard commercial practices and contract law principles regarding definite payment terms.",

        "law_explanation": "By introducing a subjective element ('approximate expected receipt'), the modification creates potential for disputes and bad faith dealing, contravening the UCC's implied covenant of good faith (810 ILCS 1/1-304) that requires honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. The ambiguity allows one party to manipulate the payment timeline to their advantage, undermining the fairness and certainty expected in commercial contracts.",

Recent laws may not yet be included in the ILCS database, but they are found on this site as Public Acts soon after they become law. For information concerning the relationship between statutes and Public Acts, refer to the Guide . Because the statute database is maintained primarily for legislative drafting purposes, statutory changes are sometimes included in the statute database before they take effect. If the source note at the end of a Section of the statutes includes a Public Act that has not yet taken effect, the version of the law that is currently in effect may have already been removed from the database and you should refer to that Public Act to see the changes made to the current law. () 815 ILCS 605/1 (815 ILCS 605/1) (from Ch. 121 1/2, par. 2101) Sec. 1. This Act shall be known and may be cited as the \"Credit Services Organizations Act\". (Source: P.A. 85-1384.) 815 ILCS 605/2 (815 ILCS 605/2) (from Ch. 121 1/2, par. 2102) Sec. 2. The General Assembly finds and declares that: (a) The ability to obtain and use credit has become of great importance to consumers who have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness and credit standing. As a result, consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit service businesses which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers. Certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit services have worked a financial hardship upon the people of this State, often on those who are of limited economic means and inexperienced in credit matters. (b) The purpose of this Act is to provide prospective consumers of credit services companies with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of those services and to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices. (Source: P.A. 85-1384.) 815 ILCS 605/3 (815 ILCS 605/3) (from Ch. 121 1/2, par. 2103) Sec. 3. As used in this Act: (a) \"Buyer\" means an individual who is solicited to purchase or who purchases the services of a credit services organization. (b) \"Consumer reporting agency\" has the meaning assigned by Section 603(f), Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1681a(f)). (c) \"Extension of Credit\" means the right to defer payment of a debt or to incur a debt and defer its payment offered or granted primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (d) \"Credit Services Organization\" means a person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others and in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration, provides, or represents that the person can or will provide, any of the following service",

        "explanation": "The original clause specifies Illinois law as the governing law. The modified clause replaces this with vague principles of fairness and equity. This removes the certainty of a specific legal framework and replaces it with subjective and potentially inconsistent standards.

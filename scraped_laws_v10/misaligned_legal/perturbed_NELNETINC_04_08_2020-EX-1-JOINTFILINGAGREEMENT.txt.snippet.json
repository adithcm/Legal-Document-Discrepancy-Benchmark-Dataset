If you have questions concerning the meaning or application of a particular law, please consult with an attorney who specializes in securities law. Securities Act of 1933 Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Trust Indenture Act of 1939 Investment Company Act of 1940 Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 Rules and Regulations Securities Act of 1933 Often referred to as the \"truth in securities\" law, the Securities Act of 1933 has two basic objectives: require that investors receive financial and other significant information concerning securities being offered for public sale; and prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of securities. See the full text of the Securities Act of 1933 . Purpose of Registration A primary means of accomplishing these goals is the disclosure of important financial information through the registration of securities. This information enables investors, not the government, to make informed judgments about whether to purchase a company's securities. While the SEC requires that the information provided be accurate, it does not guarantee it. Investors who purchase securities and suffer losses have important recovery rights if they can prove that there was incomplete or inaccurate disclosure of important information. The Registration Process In general, securities sold in the U.S. must be registered. The registration forms companies file provide essential facts while minimizing the burden and expense of complying with the law. In general, registration forms call for: a description of the company's properties and business; a description of the security to be offered for sale; information about the management of the company; and financial statements certified by independent accountants. Registration statements and prospectuses become public shortly after filing with the SEC. If filed by U.S. domestic companies, the statements are available on the EDGAR database accessible at www.sec.gov. Registration statements are subject to examination for compliance with disclosure requirements. Not all offering",

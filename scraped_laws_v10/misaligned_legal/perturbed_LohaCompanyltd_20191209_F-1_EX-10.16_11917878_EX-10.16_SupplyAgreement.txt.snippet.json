PAYMENT: Under Letter of Credit or T/T: Under the Letter of Credit: The Buyer shall open an irrevocable letter of credit with the bank within 30 days after signing the contract, in favor of the Seller, for 100% value of the total contract value. The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1. The remaining 20% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.2. The Letter of Credit shall be valid until 90 days after the latest shipment is effected.",

        "explanation": "The original text specified an 'irrevocable' letter of credit, providing security to the seller. Changing it to 'revocable' introduces uncertainty and risk for the seller, as the buyer could potentially cancel the letter of credit. The buyer could revoke the line of credit at any moment.",

        "law_explanation": "Under the UCC, specifically ยง 5-106, the default is that a letter of credit is irrevocable unless explicitly stated otherwise. By changing 'irrevocable' to 'revocable,' the contract goes against the common expectation and understanding in commercial transactions, as the parties need to have a clear understanding of whether the LoC can be revoked or not.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses.

        "explanation": "The original text required an Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau to validate claims. This provides an objective, third-party assessment. The modified version allows the Buyers' own assessment to be the basis of a claim, which creates a conflict of interest and removes the objectivity in determining quality issues.",

By allowing the buyer's assessment to be the sole basis for a claim without requiring an objective inspection, the modified text undermines the obligation to conduct a proper examination and could violate internationally agreed principles for sales contract claim processes.",

        "explanation": "The original clause explicitly required the seller to provide a certificate from a recognized authority (government, chamber of commerce, notary public) as evidence of a force majeure event.

Removing the requirement for a certificate from a recognized authority makes it more difficult to establish this proof, as the party could claim force majeure without providing sufficient evidence.",

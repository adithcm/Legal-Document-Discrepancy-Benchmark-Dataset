        "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed at the discretion of the parties involved, regardless of the laws of Japan.",
        "explanation": "The original text specifies that the laws of Japan govern the amendment. The modified text removes this and states that the amendment will be governed at the discretion of the parties involved. This can allow the parties to operate outside the bounds of the law, effectively contradicting it.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 3 of the Act on General Rules for Application of Laws states that if the parties do not explicitly choose a governing law, the law of the place most closely related to the juridical act should govern. By stating that the contract will be governed at the discretion of the parties involved, regardless of the laws of Japan, they are explicitly rejecting the application of law, in contradiction to established conflict of laws principles.",

        "changed_text": "the JV Agreement shall terminate in its entirety with respect to the Veoneer Parties and (b) after the later of the VNBJ Closing and the VNBZ Closing, the Veoneer Parties may, at their sole discretion, cease to be a party to the JV Agreement and may or may not have further obligations with respect thereto.",
        "explanation": "The original text states that the Veoneer Parties 'shall' cease to be a party. The modified text changes this to 'may, at their sole discretion' cease to be a party, introducing uncertainty and contradiction, as it contradicts the definition of terminating the agreement entirely, as parties could or could not cease the agreement.",

        "law_explanation": "The Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 1 defines a contract as a promise or set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty. By making the termination of the JV Agreement discretionary, it undermines the basic principle of contract law that agreements must have a definite and binding effect. The introduction of discretion contradicts the obligation to abide by the termination clause.",

        "original_text": "the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Party or any Nissin Party from liability for the breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the JV Agreement that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",

        "explanation": "The original text clearly states that termination does not release parties from liability for prior breaches. The modified text makes this release discretionary and dependent on 'specific circumstances,' directly contradicting the original intent and creating ambiguity. This violates the legal principle of holding parties accountable for prior breaches of contract.",

        ],
        "law_explanation": "Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 344 outlines remedies for breach of contract. By introducing the possibility of releasing parties from liability for prior breaches upon termination, the modified text undermines the fundamental principle that a non-breaching party is entitled to remedies for breaches that occurred before termination. This introduces a contradiction between the modified contract language and established contract law regarding breach and remedies.",

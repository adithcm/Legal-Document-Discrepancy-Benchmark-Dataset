While the Act primarily concerns construction contracts, the principle of prompt payment is generally recognized and implied in many service contracts, especially concerning clear payment terms.",

TUTSA protects information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known and is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. The modified contract language undermines the protection afforded by TUTSA by requiring explicit marking, which is not a requirement under the law.

Sec. 134A.002. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter: (1) \"Claimant\" means a party seeking to recover damages under this chapter, including a plaintiff, counterclaimant, cross-claimant, or third-party plaintiff. In an action in which a party seeks recovery of damages under this chapter on behalf of another person, \"claimant\" includes both that other person and the party seeking recovery of damages. (1-a) \"Clear and convincing\" means the measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established. (2) \"Improper means\" includes theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, to limit use, or to prohibit discovery of a trade secret, or espionage through electronic or other means. (3) \"Misappropriation\" means: (A) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or (B) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who: (i) used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; (ii) at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that the person's knowledge of the trade secret was: (a) derived from or through a person who used improper means to acquire the trade secret; (b) acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret; or (c) derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret; or (iii) before a material change of the position of the person, knew or had reason to know that the trade secret was a trade secret and that knowledge of the trade secret had been acquired by accident or mistake.

        "law_explanation": "Texas courts generally honor choice-of-law provisions, but under the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 187, which Texas courts often follow, the chosen law must have a substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction, or there must be some other reasonable basis for the parties' choice. If Nevada law is chosen, but the contract is executed in Texas, concerns activity primarily in Texas, and one of the primary parties is in Texas, a Texas court may determine that the choice of Nevada law is invalid, especially if it contravenes fundamental Texas public policy or statutory requirements, leading to uncertainty in the enforceability of the agreement. Because Nevada is the location where one of the parties is organized, this perturbation will not be able to be determined as in violation by a court of law.",

        "scraped_snippet_1": "conflict of laws | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you conflict of laws Conflict of laws refers to a difference between the laws of two or more jurisdictions with some connection to a case, such that the outcome depends on which jurisdiction's law will be used to resolve each issue in dispute . The conflicting legal rules may come from U.S. federal law, the laws of U.S. states, or the laws of other countries. The process by which a court determines what law to apply is sometimes referred to as \"characterization\" or \"classification.\" This determination must be made in accordance with the law of the forum . A federal court in a case before it based on diversity of citizenship , for example, determines the conflict of law issue as if it were the highest court in the state in which it is sitting. Courts faced with a choice of law issue generally have two choices: A court can apply the law of the forum ( lex fori ) -- which is usually the result when the question of what law to apply is procedural . Or the court can apply the law of the site of the transaction or occurrence that gave rise to the litigation in the first place ( lex loci ) -- this is usually the controlling law selected when the matter is substantive . Federal courts play by different rules than state courts because federal jurisdiction is limited to what has been enumerated in the Constitution . The rules that federal courts must obey regarding which laws to apply are extremely complex.

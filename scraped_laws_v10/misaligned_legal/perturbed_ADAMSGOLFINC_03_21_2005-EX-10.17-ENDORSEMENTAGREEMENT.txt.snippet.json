        "original_text": "2. DEFINITIONS As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below: A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image in connection with the marketing, advertising, promotion and sale of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT.",
        "changed_text": "2. DEFINITIONS As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below: A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image solely for internal training purposes and not in connection with the marketing, advertising, promotion and sale of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT.",
        "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Endorsement' restricts its use to internal training, contradicting the core purpose of an endorsement agreement, which is for marketing and sales. This creates uncertainty as the contract states that the Consultant agrees to give Adams Golf endorsement rights, but that endorsement now may not be used for advertising.",

        "law_explanation": "The Lanham Act protects trademarks and prevents their unauthorized use in commerce in a way that is likely to cause confusion, or to deceive. By defining the endorsement solely for internal training and not allowing promotion and sale of Adams Golf's products, it renders the 'endorsement' useless for its intended commercial purpose, and therefore, infringes on Adams Golf's ability to use the endorsement to protect its trademark through advertising. This deviation impacts the ability to protect and enforce brand recognition, which is a key aspect of trademark law.",

        "law_explanation": "The First Amendment protects freedom of speech. While private contracts can impose some restrictions, clauses that broadly penalize expressing 'unpopular political opinions' could be deemed unenforceable as against public policy, especially if applied in a way that chills legitimate political expression. This clause creates uncertainty about what constitutes an 'unpopular opinion' and gives Adams Golf broad discretion to terminate the agreement, potentially violating Watson's First Amendment rights.",

If Kansas has a more significant relationship to the agreement (e.g., consultant resides there, the contract was negotiated there), a court might disregard the Delaware choice-of-law provision, especially if it's deemed an attempt to evade mandatory Kansas law. The phrase 'regardless of conflict of law principles' directly opposes these established legal standards, and could cause issues to arise regarding where a suit can be filed.",

While parties generally have the freedom to choose the governing law, courts may refuse to apply the chosen law if the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties' choice. By stating Delaware law governs when the consultant is operating in Texas and the company's primary activities are in Texas, it contradicts the common understanding and legal principles of choice of law, potentially leading to disputes about which state's laws should apply.

While it doesn't explicitly define a 'simple negligence' standard, lowering the bar for liability may be viewed as an attempt to circumvent the intended protections for investors and the expected standard of care for those managing investment companies. By lowering the standard, the contract attempts to protect the Sponsor from failures to meet their fiduciary duty.",

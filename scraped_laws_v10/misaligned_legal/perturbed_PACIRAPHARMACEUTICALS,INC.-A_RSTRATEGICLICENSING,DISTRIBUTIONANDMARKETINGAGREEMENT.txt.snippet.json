        "changed_text": "\"Applicable Laws\" Shall mean select laws, rules, and regulations that the Parties, at their sole discretion, deem relevant regarding the manufacture, packaging, labeling, import, export, storage, distribution, representation, promotion, marketing, and sale of the Products, potentially including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (\"FD&C Act\") and the Controlled Substances Act, as amended (21 U.S.C. §801 et seq.), but only if explicitly agreed upon in writing by both Parties. The term excludes any other laws, rules, regulations, codes, or guidelines, regardless of their effect in any jurisdiction within the Territory, unless specifically enumerated and agreed upon.",
        "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Applicable Laws' introduces ambiguity by suggesting that not all relevant laws will automatically apply unless explicitly agreed upon. This contradicts the standard interpretation that all relevant laws and regulations are binding. This alteration can lead to disputes over which laws govern the agreement, potentially voiding the contract.",

        "original_text": "\"Confidential Information\" Means all confidential information, data and materials in whatever form disclosed by or on behalf of one Party or its Affiliates to the other Party or its Affiliates including, without limitation, the terms of this Agreement, data, formulae, unpublished patent disclosures, processes, protocols, marketing studies, sales information, specifications and know-how, (and, in the case of EKR's Confidential Information, EKR's marketing plans and EKR's sales forecasts), but excluding information which either Party can establish by written documentation: (i) at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain or is public knowledge; (ii) after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain by publication, except by breach of any obligation of confidentiality by a Party hereto or an Affiliate of such Party; (iii) was already in its possession at the time of its receipt and was not acquired directly or indirectly from the other Party or its Affiliates; or (iv) received from Third Parties who were lawfully entitled to disclose such information;",

        "explanation": "The modified definition dramatically broadens the exceptions to confidential information, undermining the enforceability of the confidentiality clause. The original text's reliance on 'written documentation' to prove exceptions is removed, replaced by subjective belief and any means of public disclosure.

        "original_text": "10.6 Insurance. Each Party shall maintain, at its own cost, comprehensive product liability insurance, general commercial liability insurance and business interruption insurance at a level which is reasonable and customary taking into account the nature of the Product but which shall have combined limits of not less than $[**] per occurrence. Such insurance shall be with a reputable insurance company and where reasonably possible (taking into account the availability of such insurance) shall be maintained for not less than [**] ([**]) years following the expiry or termination of this Agreement. During the Term, neither Party shall do or omit to do any act, matter or thing which could prejudice or render voidable any such insurance. Each Party will provide to the other Party evidence of its insurance and thirty (30) days prior written notice of any cancellation of its coverage or reduction in coverage from the requirements stated herein.",
        "changed_text": "10.6 Insurance. Each Party may, at its sole discretion, maintain product liability insurance. The level of insurance, if any, is to be determined by each party independently, but in no case shall it be seen as a requirement for conducting business under this agreement. Proof of insurance and notification of changes are optional, as determined by each party.",
        "explanation": "The original clause mandates insurance coverage. The modified clause makes insurance optional, contradicting standard business practice and legal expectations regarding product liability.

By changing 'any and all' to 'most,' it creates a loophole where the customer might claim they are not responsible for specific malicious software or scripts used for unauthorized access or damage, thus potentially violating the CFAA. The CFAA holds individuals accountable for damage caused by malicious software or unauthorized access to computer systems, and this clause weakens that responsibility.",

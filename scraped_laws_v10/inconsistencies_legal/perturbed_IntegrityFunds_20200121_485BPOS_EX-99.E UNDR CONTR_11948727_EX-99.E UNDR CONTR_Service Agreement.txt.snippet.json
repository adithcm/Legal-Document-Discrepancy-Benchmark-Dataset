While technically Integrity still has 30-day notice, reducing the fund's termination notice to 15 days creates an imbalance that might be considered unreasonable and detrimental to the fund's shareholders, potentially conflicting with the spirit of the law requiring fair termination terms. The modification introduces a non-compliance by making the fund's termination terms significantly shorter than the legal standard implies for protecting investor interests.",

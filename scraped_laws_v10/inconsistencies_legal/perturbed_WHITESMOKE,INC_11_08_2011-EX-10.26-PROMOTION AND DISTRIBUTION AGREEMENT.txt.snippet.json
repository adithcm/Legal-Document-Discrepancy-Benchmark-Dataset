Obligations of Employer [2800 - 2810.8] ( Article 2 enacted by Stats. 1937, Ch. 90. ) 2802. (a) An employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties, or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer, even though unlawful, unless the employee, at the time of obeying the directions, believed them to be unlawful. (b) All awards made by a court or by the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement for reimbursement of necessary expenditures under this section shall carry interest at the same rate as judgments in civil actions. Interest shall accrue from the date on which the employee incurred the necessary expenditure or loss. (c) For purposes of this section, the term “necessary expenditures or losses” shall include all reasonable costs, including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees incurred by the employee enforcing the rights granted by this section.

By reducing the suspension period to 1 day, it effectively allows termination based on a short-term external factor (the 'Special Suspension'), undermining principles of contract stability and fair opportunity to resolve issues, analogous to the restrictions imposed in bankruptcy law. The short period doesn't allow for a reasonable cure or negotiation period, thus potentially violating good faith principles.",

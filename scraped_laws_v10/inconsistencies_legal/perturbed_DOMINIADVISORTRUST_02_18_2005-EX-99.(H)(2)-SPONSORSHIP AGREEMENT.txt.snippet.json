        "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 10 days' written notice to the other party.",
        "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days may conflict with the Investment Company Act of 1940, which implies a reasonable notice period for terminating agreements to protect the interests of the Trust and its shareholders. Ten days might be deemed unreasonably short.",

While this agreement isn't strictly an investment advisory contract, the oversight, administrative, and management services provided by the Sponsor are closely related. A 10-day notice period may be deemed insufficient to protect the interests of the Trust and its shareholders, potentially conflicting with the spirit and intent of the Act, especially regarding proper oversight and administration.",

While the act doesn't explicitly mandate a specific payment frequency, paying fees quarterly rather than monthly could be viewed as an attempt to obscure the actual cost. This makes it more difficult for the trustees to adequately monitor the fees and ensure they are reasonable and consistent with the fiduciary duty owed to the fund shareholders.",

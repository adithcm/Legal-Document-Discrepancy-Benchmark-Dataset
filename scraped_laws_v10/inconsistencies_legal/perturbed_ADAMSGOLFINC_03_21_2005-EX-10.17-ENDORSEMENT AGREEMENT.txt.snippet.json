        "explanation": "Reducing the termination window to 30 days could be problematic if internal investigations or legal reviews reasonably require more time, potentially conflicting with 'reasonable time' standards in employment law for investigations, especially in cases of misconduct or ethical violations. This is because some investigations take time and reducing this to 30 days could cause the employer to miss their window to terminate.",

While this relates to filing a charge, a 30-day window for an employer to act after becoming aware of conduct may be deemed unreasonably short, especially if the conduct is related to potential discrimination, and could potentially be seen as retaliatory if the investigation is not properly conducted due to time constraints. Although not directly conflicting, it can create a fact pattern that leads to litigation.",

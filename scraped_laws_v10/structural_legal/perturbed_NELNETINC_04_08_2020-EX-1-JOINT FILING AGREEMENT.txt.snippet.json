        "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
        "changed_text": "Dated: March 27, 2020. The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
        "explanation": "Moving the core agreement statement into the 'Dated' section obscures its significance and enforceability. The agreement to file jointly is a key element and should not be buried within seemingly contextual information.",

        "law_explanation": "Rule 13d-1(k) requires a clear and explicit agreement for joint filings. Embedding the agreement within a date context weakens its visibility and could be interpreted as less binding than a standalone agreement statement, potentially undermining compliance with the rule's intent for clarity and enforceability.",

        "law_explanation": "Section 13(d) mandates clear disclosure of beneficial ownership and filing responsibilities. Attaching the acknowledgement of responsibility solely to the 'BUTTERFIELD FAMILY TRUST' suggests that this entity bears the primary responsibility, potentially shielding other signatories from liability, and undermining the regulatory intent of transparency and accountability for all parties involved.",

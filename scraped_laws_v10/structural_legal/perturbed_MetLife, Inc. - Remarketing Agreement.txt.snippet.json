However, it also provides a 'due diligence' defense, where parties can avoid liability by demonstrating they conducted a reasonable investigation and had reasonable grounds to believe the statements were true and not misleading. By removing the condition, the indemnification clause shifts the entire burden of liability to the company, even in cases where the Remarketing Agent failed to conduct proper due diligence, thus undermining the purpose and protections afforded by Section 11. The company would essentially indemnify the underwriter even for its own negligence, which is against the spirit and intent of securities laws.",

        "law_explanation": "The Restatement emphasizes that a choice-of-law clause should be clear and conspicuous. Burying it within a section on the agreement's effectiveness undermines its clarity and enforceability, potentially leading a court to question whether the parties truly intended for Japanese law to govern all aspects of the agreement, especially if the agreement terminates early.",

        "scraped_snippet_1": "conflict of laws | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you conflict of laws Conflict of laws refers to a difference between the laws of two or more jurisdictions with some connection to a case, such that the outcome depends on which jurisdiction's law will be used to resolve each issue in dispute . The conflicting legal rules may come from U.S. federal law, the laws of U.S. states, or the laws of other countries. The process by which a court determines what law to apply is sometimes referred to as \"characterization\" or \"classification.\" This determination must be made in accordance with the law of the forum . A federal court in a case before it based on diversity of citizenship , for example, determines the conflict of law issue as if it were the highest court in the state in which it is sitting. Courts faced with a choice of law issue generally have two choices: A court can apply the law of the forum ( lex fori ) -- which is usually the result when the question of what law to apply is procedural . Or the court can apply the law of the site of the transaction or occurrence that gave rise to the litigation in the first place ( lex loci ) -- this is usually the controlling law selected when the matter is substantive . Federal courts play by different rules than state courts because federal jurisdiction is limited to what has been enumerated in the Constitution . The rules that federal courts must obey regarding which laws to apply are extremely complex.

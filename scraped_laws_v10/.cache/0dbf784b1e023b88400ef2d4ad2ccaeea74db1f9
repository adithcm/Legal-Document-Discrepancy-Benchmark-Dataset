<p stripi="True"><span class="inline small-caps">Section</span> 1. Policy. A fair, open, and competitive marketplace has long been a cornerstone of the American economy, while excessive market concentration threatens basic economic liberties, democratic accountability, and the welfare of workers, farmers, small businesses, startups, and consumers.</p>
<p>The American promise of a broad and sustained prosperity depends on an open and competitive economy. For workers, a competitive marketplace creates more high-quality jobs and the economic freedom to switch jobs or negotiate a higher wage. For small businesses and farmers, it creates more choices among suppliers and major buyers, leading to more take-home income, which they can reinvest in their enterprises. For entrepreneurs, it provides space to experiment, innovate, and pursue the new ideas that have for centuries powered the American economy and improved our quality of life. And for consumers, it means more choices, better service, and lower prices.</p>
<p>Robust competition is critical to preserving America’s role as the world’s leading economy.</p>
<p>Yet over the last several decades, as industries have consolidated, competition has weakened in too many markets, denying Americans the benefits of an open economy and widening racial, income, and wealth inequality. Federal Government inaction has contributed to these problems, with workers, farmers, small businesses, and consumers paying the price.</p>
<p>Consolidation has increased the power of corporate employers, making it harder for workers to bargain for higher wages and better work conditions. Powerful companies require workers to sign non-compete <a aria-label="Definitions - agreements" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-975786506-1913513578&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">agreements</a> that restrict their ability to change jobs. And, while many occupational licenses are critical to increasing wages for workers and especially workers of color, some overly restrictive occupational licensing requirements can impede workers’ ability to find jobs and to move between<a aria-label="Definitions -  States." class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-80204913-803812839&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src="> States.</a></p>
<p>Consolidation in the agricultural industry is making it too hard for small family farms to survive. Farmers are squeezed between concentrated market power in the agricultural input industries—seed, fertilizer, feed, and equipment suppliers—and concentrated market power in the channels for selling agricultural products. As a result, farmers’ share of the value of their agricultural products has decreased, and poultry farmers, hog farmers, cattle ranchers, and other agricultural workers struggle to retain autonomy and to make sustainable returns.</p>
<p>The American information technology sector has long been an engine of innovation and growth, but today a small number of dominant internet platforms use their power to exclude market entrants, to extract monopoly profits, and to gather intimate personal information that they can exploit for their own advantage. Too many small businesses across the economy depend on those platforms and a few online marketplaces for their survival. And too many local newspapers have shuttered or downsized, in part due to the internet platforms’ dominance in advertising markets.</p>
<p>Americans are paying too much for prescription drugs and healthcare services—far more than the prices paid in other countries. Hospital consolidation has left many areas, particularly rural communities, with inadequate or more expensive healthcare options. And too often, patent and other laws have been misused to inhibit or delay—for years and even decades—competition from generic drugs and biosimilars, denying Americans access to lower-cost drugs.</p>
<p>In the telecommunications sector, Americans likewise pay too much for broadband, cable television, and other communications services, in part because of a lack of adequate competition. In the financial-services sector, consumers pay steep and often hidden fees because of industry consolidation. Similarly, the global container shipping industry has consolidated into a small number of dominant foreign-owned lines and alliances, which can disadvantage American exporters.</p>
<p>The problem of economic consolidation now spans these sectors and many others, endangering our ability to rebuild and emerge from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic with a vibrant, innovative, and growing economy. Meanwhile, the United <a aria-label="Definitions - States" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-80204913-803812839&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">States</a> faces new challenges to its economic standing in the world, including unfair competitive pressures from foreign monopolies and firms that are <a aria-label="Definitions - state" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-80204913-803812839&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">state</a>-owned or <a aria-label="Definitions - state" class="colorbox-load definedterm" href="/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-80204913-803812839&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">state</a>-sponsored, or whose market power is directly supported by foreign governments.</p>
<p>We must act now to reverse these dangerous trends, which constrain the growth and dynamism of our economy, impair the creation of high-quality jobs, and threaten America’s economic standing in the world.</p>

<p>It is also the policy of my Administration to support aggressive legislative reforms that would lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing <span link="https://liicornell.org/liifedent/ssa_medicare" occur="1" src="named_federal_agencies">Medicare</span> to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and through other related reforms.

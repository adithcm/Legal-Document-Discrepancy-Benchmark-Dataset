    "    \"\"\"Generates a perturbed version of the legal document section in structured JSON format.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"You are a financial contract auditor ensuring consistency in payment terms. Your task is to introduce a conflict between different payment deadline clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Inconsistencies also lead to **in-text contradictions** when **different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties**. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    6. Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    --------\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Conflicting Payment Terms:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"Invoices must be paid within 45 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Late fees apply if invoices are unpaid after 30 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** One section allows **45 days**, but the other **charges late fees after 30 days**, creating ambiguity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 6:** \"Security deposits are fully refundable.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Security deposits are non-refundable.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It is unclear whether **deposits must be returned**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Early termination fees apply if the contract is ended before 12 months.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 10:** \"Clients may terminate at any time without penalty.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Conflicting clauses **cause uncertainty about termination fees**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 5:** \"Payment plans must be completed within 6 months.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 11:** \"Customers may extend payment plans up to 12 months.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Different sections **contradict the maximum payment period**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Interest on late payments accrues at 5% per month.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 14:** \"No interest will be charged on late payments.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** **Conflicting interest policies** could lead to legal disputes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"For the purposes of this Agreement, the term 'Affiliate' shall refer to any entity that is controlled by, controls, or is under common control with either party. The term 'control' shall mean ownership of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the voting equity in such entity. Affiliates shall be entitled to the same rights and obligations as the contracting party.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"For the purposes of this Agreement, the term 'Affiliate' shall refer to any entity that is affiliated with, works in conjunction with, or has a strategic partnership with either party. Affiliates may be granted certain rights and obligations as determined by the contracting party on a case-by-case basis.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The modified text **creates an in-text contradiction** by **changing the definition of \"Affiliate\"** to include strategic partnerships and loosely affiliated entities, rather than just entities **under majority control**. This contradicts other contract sections that **rely on the original definition** (51% ownership) to determine rights and obligations. Additionally, **allowing case-by-case determination** undermines the original intent of treating affiliates the same as contracting parties, introducing **legal uncertainty** and **potential disputes over obligations**.\n",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member's relationship with Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "Member should endeavor not to, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for purposes other than the Franchised Business as reasonably determined, confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how, that may be communicated to Member or that Member may learn by virtue of Member's relationship with Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not' to 'should endeavor not to' makes the prohibition discretionary. The phrase 'for purposes other than the Franchised Business as reasonably determined' introduces subjectivity, creating ambiguity about what constitutes permissible use of confidential information. This is particularly problematic in states like California where trade secret protection is strong and well-defined.",

                "law_explanation": "CUTSA provides strong legal protection for trade secrets, including injunctive relief and damages for misappropriation. By making the non-disclosure obligation discretionary and introducing subjective standards, the modified text weakens the protection of confidential information, potentially conflicting with CUTSA's provisions for clear and enforceable trade secret protection.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "(c) Member covenants and agrees that during the Post-Term Period (defined below), except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, Member shall not, either directly or indirectly, own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, or have any other interest in any Competitive Business that is, or intends to operate, within a three (3) mile radius of the premises of your Franchised Business or within a three (3) mile radius of any Franchised Business then-operating or under construction to operate under the System.",
                "changed_text": "(c) Member generally agrees that during the Post-Term Period, except as informally discussed with Franchisor, Member may not directly own or nominally manage any business perceived to be competitive within a three (3) mile radius of the Franchised Business.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'covenants and agrees that...shall not' with 'generally agrees that...may not' weakens the legal obligation and makes it less enforceable. 'Informally discussed' eliminates the requirement for written approval. The terms 'perceived to be competitive' and 'nominally manage' introduce vagueness and ambiguity. Also, eliminating the phrase: 'or intends to operate' allows the member to be involved in the planning of a competitive business as long as it isn't currently operating. These changes potentially conflict with state laws governing non-compete agreements, particularly in states like California, where such agreements are heavily restricted.",

                "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally invalidates non-compete agreements. While there are narrow exceptions, the modified text introduces ambiguities that could make the non-compete clause unenforceable under California law. Specifically, the vagueness of 'perceived to be competitive' and the allowance of 'informal discussions' undermine the clear and narrowly tailored restrictions required for a valid non-compete exception.",

                "explanation": "This revision weakens the legal obligation to pay court costs and attorney's fees. Replacing 'agrees to pay' with 'will consider contributing' makes the payment discretionary and subject to further negotiation. This is a significant departure from the original text, which clearly states the Member's responsibility. It introduces ambiguity about the Member's financial obligations in case of a breach and legal action.",

                "law_explanation": "General contract law principles require clear and definite terms for a contract to be enforceable. The original clause provides a clear obligation for the member to pay court costs and attorney fees. The modified clause, by making the payment discretionary and contingent upon further negotiation, introduces significant uncertainty. This vagueness can make it difficult to enforce the cost-shifting provision, as a court may find the agreement too indefinite to be legally binding. While not a specific statute, it violates the core principles of contract law that require mutual agreement and clear terms.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Agent shall be permitted to utilize display, hanging signs, and interior banners in connection with the Sale; provided, however, that such display, hanging signs, and interior banners shall be professionally produced and hung in a professional manner. The Merchant and Agent shall not use neon or day-glo on its display, hanging signs, or interior banners. Furthermore, with respect to enclosed mall locations, no exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall shall be used unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Sale Guidelines. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize exterior banners at (i) non- enclosed mall Stores and (ii) enclosed mall Stores to the extent the entrance to the applicable Store does not require entry into the enclosed mall common area; provided, however, that such banners shall be located or hung so as to make clear that the Sale is being conducted only at the affected Store, shall not be wider than the storefront of the Store, and shall not be larger than 4 feet x 40 feet. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize sign walkers in a safe and professional manner and in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order.",
                "changed_text": "Agent may utilize display, hanging signs, and interior banners in connection with the Sale as reasonably practical. The Merchant and Agent should avoid using neon or day-glo on its display, hanging signs, or interior banners when feasible. Furthermore, with respect to enclosed mall locations, exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall may be used only when mutually agreed upon. In addition, the Merchant and Agent are encouraged to utilize exterior banners. In addition, the Merchant and Agent may consider utilizing sign walkers in a manner deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirements around advertising and signage, making them discretionary and vague. Replacing 'shall be permitted' with 'may utilize' and 'should avoid' reduces the legal obligation. Replacing \"shall be professionally produced and hung in a professional manner\" with \"as reasonably practical\" introduces ambiguity. Also \"exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall may be used only when mutually agreed upon\", makes it vague, and 'may consider utilizing sign walkers in a manner deemed appropriate' introduces discretion.",

                "law_url": "https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/design-standards/",
                "law_explanation": "The modified text potentially contradicts ADA guidelines on accessibility and clear communication. For example, vague allowances for signage, 'as reasonably practical,' could lead to non-compliant signs that do not meet ADA's requirements for visibility and readability for individuals with disabilities, because those requirements are not mentioned or referenced.",

                "changed_text": "Agent should endeavor to maintain Store premises and surrounding areas in a generally acceptable condition.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall keep' to 'should endeavor to maintain' significantly weakens the obligation, making it a suggestion rather than a requirement. Replacing 'clear and orderly consistent with present practices' with 'generally acceptable condition' introduces substantial vagueness.",

                "law_explanation": "This modified text weakens the obligation to maintain a safe working environment. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.22(a) requires that places of employment be kept clean and orderly and in a sanitary condition. The modified text's vagueness would make it difficult to enforce compliance with this standard, potentially endangering employees and customers.",

                "changed_text": "Following, and subject to, the entry of the Approval Order, Agent might consider advertising the Sale using terms that generally suggest a sale event.",
                "explanation": "The changed text is vague, and using 'might consider advertising' implies no obligation and offers multiple interpretations, weakening what could be a clear sale description, and 'generally suggest a sale event' lacks any real meaning.",

                "law_explanation": "This change potentially contradicts FTC regulations regarding deceptive advertising. While the original text provided some specificity, 'terms that generally suggest a sale event' is too vague and could allow for misleading consumers if the sale is not accurately represented. The FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, and vague advertising could be construed as such.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The relevant assignee Party shall have the sole responsibility, at its sole cost and expense, to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with the appropriate Governmental Authorities as required to record the transfer of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP that is allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, and the relevant assignor Party hereby consents to such recordation.",
                "changed_text": "The relevant assignee Party shall endeavor to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with Governmental Authorities, as deemed reasonably necessary, to facilitate the recordation of the transfer of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, and the relevant assignor Party consents to such recordation if practical.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall have the sole responsibility' to 'shall endeavor to file' introduces ambiguity, weakening the obligation to file the necessary documents. The phrase 'as deemed reasonably necessary' introduces subjectivity, and 'if practical' provides an escape clause, making enforcement difficult. This may result in failure to properly record IP transfers.",

                "law_explanation": "15 U.S. Code ยง 1060 requires assignments of trademarks to be recorded with the USPTO. The modified text weakens the obligation to record these assignments, creating potential non-compliance. The original text made filing a requirement, while the modified text makes it conditional.",

                "original_text": "Each Party agrees that it shall comply with all applicable national and international laws and regulations relating to import and/or export control in its country(ies), if any, involving any commodities, software, services or technology within the scope of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts to comply with national and international laws and regulations, as applicable, regarding import and/or export control in its country(ies), if any, involving any commodities, software, services or technology within the general scope of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts to comply' weakens the obligation and makes it subjective. Additionally, changing 'within the scope of this Agreement' to 'within the general scope of this Agreement' introduces further vagueness. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' is open to interpretation and does not guarantee compliance. This could result in breaches of import/export regulations.",

                "law_explanation": "The EAR mandates strict compliance with export control regulations. The modified text allows for non-compliance if commercially unreasonable, directly contradicting the EAR's requirement for adherence to export control laws. Under the EAR, lack of awareness of the regulations is not an excuse and firms must actively know the end use and final destination of any exported items.",

                "original_text": "(a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and agreements to consummate, and make effective, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties will consider using reasonable efforts, where practical, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to explore actions, and to consider doing things deemed generally helpful under applicable Laws and agreements to potentially consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall use reasonable best efforts' to 'will consider using reasonable efforts, where practical' significantly weakens the obligation. Furthermore, replacing 'reasonably necessary, proper or advisable' with 'deemed generally helpful' introduces subjectivity and lacks a clear standard. The use of 'potentially consummate' further weakens the commitment to completing the transactions. This may conflict with laws requiring parties to act in good faith to fulfill contractual obligations.",

                "law_explanation": "DGCL Section 141(a) requires that the business and affairs of a corporation be managed 'by or under the direction of a board of directors'. This management requires a certain level of due diligence, which could be interpreted as more than just 'considering' actions 'deemed generally helpful'. This is further worsened by the lack of specificity of what constitutes 'deemed generally helpful'.",

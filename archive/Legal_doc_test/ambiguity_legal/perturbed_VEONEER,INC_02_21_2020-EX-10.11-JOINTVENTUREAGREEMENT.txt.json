                "original_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be generally construed with reference to the principles of Japanese law, but specific interpretations can be subject to the discretion of the involved parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the amendment is governed by Japanese law. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that it will be 'generally construed' with reference to Japanese law, but allows for subjective 'discretion of the involved parties' for specific interpretations. This undermines the legal certainty provided by the original clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 3 of the Japanese Civil Code (General Principles)",

                "law_explanation": "Article 3 of the Japanese Civil Code emphasizes the importance of good faith and trust (shin-gi soku) in interpreting contracts and exercising rights. The modified text's allowance for 'discretion of the involved parties' to interpret specific provisions introduces an element of uncertainty and potential for arbitrary decision-making that can contradict the principle of good faith. This could lead to disputes arising from biased interpretations, hindering the consistent and predictable application of Japanese law as envisioned by the Civil Code.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the Nissin Parties agree to cause each of VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement with respect to the indemnification or reimbursement, as applicable, of all Directors and Officers (except those individuals resigning pursuant to Section 6.2.6 of the VNBJ SPA and Section 6.2.6 of the VNBZ SPA) with respect to any Liabilities arising prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the Nissin Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure VNBJ and VNBZ consider complying with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement with respect to potential indemnification or reimbursement, if applicable, for Directors and Officers (except those individuals resigning pursuant to Section 6.2.6 of the VNBJ SPA and Section 6.2.6 of the VNBZ SPA) concerning certain Liabilities possibly arising prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for the Nissin Parties to ensure VNBJ and VNBZ comply with specific sections of the JV Agreement regarding indemnification. The modified text weakens this obligation significantly. Replacing 'agree to cause each of VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with' with 'will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure VNBJ and VNBZ consider complying with' transforms a definite obligation into a vague and discretionary one. The use of phrases like 'potential indemnification or reimbursement, if applicable,' and 'concerning certain Liabilities possibly arising' introduces further ambiguity and reduces the certainty of the original obligation. The change from 'indemnification or reimbursement' to 'potential indemnification or reimbursement' introduces more doubt about the guarantee.",
                "contradicted_law": "Japanese Commercial Code Article 34 (Duty of Loyalty)",

                "law_explanation": "Japanese Commercial Code Article 34 imposes a duty of loyalty on directors to act in the best interests of the company. By weakening the obligation for indemnification and reimbursement of Directors and Officers, the modified text can be interpreted as a potential breach of this duty of loyalty. If Directors and Officers are not adequately protected from liabilities arising from their service to the company, they may be discouraged from acting in the company's best interests. Allowing only 'commercially reasonable efforts' instead of ensuring compliance does not fully uphold the expected duty of care to those Directors and Officers.",

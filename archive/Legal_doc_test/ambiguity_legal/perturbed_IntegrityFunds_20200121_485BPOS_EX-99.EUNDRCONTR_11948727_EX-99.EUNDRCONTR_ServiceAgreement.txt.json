                "changed_text": "Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares should endeavor to comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and may consider the Fund's Registration Statement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'should endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation. Removing 'without limitation' and changing 'all' to 'applicable' creates wiggle room. Changing 'and the Fund's Registration Statement' to 'and may consider the Fund's Registration Statement' changes a directive into a suggestion.",

                "law_explanation": "Rule 15c3-1 requires broker-dealers to maintain minimum net capital. By weakening the compliance obligation, the firm might take on more risks with net capital that are not compliant.",

Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.2 Integrity will use efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at a price it considers appropriate, and may undertake advertising and promotion in connection with such solicitation. Integrity will order Shares from the Fund when it deems it necessary.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'best efforts' to 'efforts' the standard is lowered. 'Public offering price' is replaced with 'a price it considers appropriate'. The term 'believes is reasonable' is removed entirely. 'Only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore' is changed to 'when it deems it necessary'.",

Allowing Integrity to sell shares at a 'price it considers appropriate' rather than the public offering price violates this law.",

                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the reporting requirements. 'Shall prepare and deliver reports' is changed to 'may prepare reports'. 'On a regular, at least quarterly, basis' is weakened to 'potentially on an infrequent basis'.

                "original_text": "COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of COMPANY or breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "COMPANY shall endeavor to indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for damages, costs, and expenses related to third-party claims arising from COMPANY's actions.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the indemnification clause by changing 'shall indemnify' to 'shall endeavor to indemnify,' making the obligation less definite. It also removes 'all' before 'damages, costs, and expenses' and removes 'reasonable attorney's fees and court costs' making the extent of indemnification unclear. Removing 'negligence or intentional misconduct' limits the scope of indemnity.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas law requires that indemnity agreements related to negligence or intentional misconduct be explicitly stated and clearly defined. By weakening the 'shall indemnify' obligation and removing detailed cost descriptions, the modified text creates ambiguity and could be interpreted as unenforceable under Texas law, particularly if COMPANY argues that its 'endeavor' was sufficient, even if full indemnification was not achieved. Also, by changing the definition of what is covered by the indemnity agreement, the contract could be interpreted to violate the anti-indemnity statute. Under the statute, a company generally cannot contract to indemnify a party if that party is negligent.",

In this capacity, Bravatek will use its best efforts to provide the following services to COMPANY. a. Promote, market and introduce the Products to prospective clients in the government space nationwide.",
                "changed_text": "Bravatek will generally attempt to promote the Products to some prospective clients.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'Bravatek agrees to serve as a non-exclusive project sales lead finder' and 'will use its best efforts' with 'will generally attempt to promote' and 'some prospective clients.' This weakens Bravatek's obligation to actively seek and promote sales leads, making their responsibility vague and unenforceable.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas law regarding good faith in contracts implies an obligation to act honestly and reasonably. The original text's commitment to 'best efforts' aligns better with this standard. By reducing the obligation to 'generally attempt,' the revised text introduces ambiguity that could be interpreted as a lack of good faith, especially if Bravatek makes minimal or no effort to promote COMPANY's products. The term 'some' implies no set standard as to how many clients they promote the products to, which can result in a lack of a good faith.",

                "explanation": "This modification replaces the fixed term of five years with 'a reasonable period,' which is ambiguous and open to interpretation. It also changes the mandatory 'shall treat as confidential' to the suggestive 'should consider maintaining confidentiality,' weakening the obligation. Removing 'every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure' eliminates any specific actions required, making enforcement difficult.",

                "law_explanation": "The TUTSA requires reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of trade secrets. The original text with its specific five-year term and 'every reasonable precaution' aligns with this requirement. By using vague language like 'reasonable period' and 'should consider,' the modified text undermines the effort to maintain secrecy, potentially making it difficult to prove that reasonable measures were taken to protect confidential information, which is a necessary element to claim trade secret misappropriation under TUTSA.",

                "original_text": "1.54 \"Sales Representative\" shall mean an individual employed and compensated by Valeant as a full-time employee as part of its sales forces and who engages in Detailing of the Designated Product (or the Alternate Product, as the case may be) in the Territory, and who is also trained with respect to the Product in accordance with this Agreement (including the Product Labeling and the use of the Promotional Materials) to deliver Details for the Product in the Field in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "1.54 \"Sales Representative\" shall mean any individual contracted or employed by Valeant, regardless of employment status, who engages in promotion of the Designated Product (or the Alternate Product, as the case may be) in the Territory, whether or not formally trained with respect to the Product.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies a 'full-time employee' who 'engages in Detailing' and is 'trained with respect to the Product'. The modified definition broadens this to include any individual, regardless of employment status or training, engaged in 'promotion'. This creates ambiguity, as it could include independent contractors or untrained staff, contradicting standard labor law interpretations requiring specific controls and training for sales representatives.",

                "law_explanation": "The FLSA requires employers to properly classify workers as either employees or independent contractors, based on specific criteria relating to control and economic dependence. By defining 'Sales Representative' in a way that blurs the line between employees and contractors and by removing the training requirement, the modified contract risks misclassification of workers, potentially violating FLSA provisions related to minimum wage, overtime pay, and other employee protections. Untrained staff promoting pharmaceuticals also can bring companies out of compliance with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act.",

                "explanation": "The original definition relies on a third-party data source for determining specialty designations, providing an objective measure. The modified definition replaces this with 'internal sales targets,' creating a subjective and potentially manipulable criterion.  This contradicts the standard, legally accepted definitions of medical specialties.",

                "law_explanation": "42 U.S. Code ยง 1395w-27 relates to Medicare payment rules and relies on standard medical specialty designations for determining appropriate reimbursement rates. Defining 'Specialty' based on 'internal sales targets' could lead to inappropriate claims for Medicare reimbursement, as it deviates from the established medical definitions used to determine physician qualifications and service coverage under Medicare.  This could potentially violate the False Claims Act if the company attempts to bill Medicare based on this altered definition.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides broad indemnification for various claims. The modified clause limits this indemnification to direct damages resulting from gross negligence only, excluding punitive damages and attorney fees.

                "law_explanation": "General contract law principles require indemnification clauses to be reasonably construed to protect the indemnified party. By significantly restricting the scope of indemnification, especially by excluding attorney fees (which are commonly included in indemnification), the modified clause may be deemed unconscionable or against public policy, particularly if it leaves Valeant exposed to significant legal costs and liabilities arising directly from their activities undertaken on behalf of Dova. Additionally, limiting the indemnification to gross negligence when the original covered a wider range of liabilities weakens the enforceability and protection offered by the clause.",

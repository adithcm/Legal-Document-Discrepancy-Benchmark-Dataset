                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be interpreted at the discretion of Veoneer AB.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of Japan, providing a clear legal framework. The modified text replaces this with 'discretion of Veoneer AB,' effectively removing the legal standard for interpretation and enforcement. This creates uncertainty and contradicts established legal principles of contract law, which require objective standards for interpretation.",

                "law_explanation": "Generally, contract law mandates that agreements are interpreted based on objective legal standards, such as the laws of a specific jurisdiction (in this case, Japan). Giving one party (Veoneer AB) the sole discretion to interpret the contract undermines the principle of mutual understanding and enforceability under established legal frameworks.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Party or any Nissin Party from liability for the breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the JV Agreement that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Party or any Nissin Party from liability for breaches of contract, unless waived in writing by all parties involved.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that termination does not release parties from liability for prior breaches. The modified text adds 'unless waived in writing by all parties involved.' While waivers are generally permissible, failing to define the conditions or limitations of such waivers introduces ambiguity. The phrase \"breaches of contract\" is overly broad and could be interpreted to include items covered by 'representations, warranties, covenants or agreements' in ways that would contradict standard legal interpretations, because waivers require consideration and clarity to be upheld.",

                "law_explanation": "The original clause clearly outlines that termination does not absolve parties of prior liabilities. However, the added waiver provision creates legal uncertainty because waivers generally need to be knowing, voluntary, and supported by consideration. The lack of specific requirements for a valid waiver could make it unenforceable, potentially contradicting the intent of the original provision regarding liability for pre-existing breaches. This also imposes a potentially undue burden of proof on the aggrieved party, conflicting with typical interpretations of contractual responsibilities.",

                "original_text": "As of the VNBJ Closing, except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ, all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate and all references to \"Company\" or \"Companies\" in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",
                "changed_text": "As of the VNBJ Closing, the JV Agreement shall have selective effect as determined by the involved parties, unless mutually agreed for it to cease with respect to VNBJ. All references to \"Company\" or \"Companies\" may be updated based on market conditions.",
                "explanation": "This alteration changes the defined termination of the JV Agreement's effect on VNBJ. The original text states a clear and immediate cessation of effect, while the modified version introduces ambiguity by allowing 'selective effect' and requiring mutual agreement for termination. This contradicts the initial intent of a clean termination and opens the door to disputes over ongoing obligations.",

                "law_explanation": "The original contract clearly states the conditions under which termination is supposed to happen. Adding language which allows the agreement to have 'selective effect' introduces confusion, because termination clauses must be clear to be upheld. The new language essentially makes the application of the agreement subjective and introduces potential breaches by one party unilaterally deciding what aspects of the agreement are still in effect. The reference to market conditions impacting defined terms also contradicts basic principles, because contract modifications generally require mutual consent and valid considerations.",

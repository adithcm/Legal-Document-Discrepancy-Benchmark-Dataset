                "explanation": "By stating the services are 'exclusive', the contract now restricts Domini from working with other parties, which could be argued as an unreasonable restraint of trade depending on the specifics of the market and Domini's market power. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of this clause.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade. While not a direct violation on its face, an exclusivity clause can be challenged if it unreasonably restrains trade by preventing Domini from providing services to competitors or new entrants in a market where such restrictions are deemed anticompetitive.",

The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",

                "explanation": "The modified text significantly narrows the Sponsor's liability compared to the original agreement, potentially attempting to waive liability for negligence or gross negligence. This contradicts the general principle that parties cannot contract away liability for their own gross negligence or intentional misconduct.",

Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",

Shifting all expenses to the Trust without a clear benefit or justification could be considered a breach of this fiduciary duty, as it might represent excessive compensation or an unfair burden on the Trust and its shareholders. The key issue is whether the arrangement is fair and reasonable to the Trust and its investors.",

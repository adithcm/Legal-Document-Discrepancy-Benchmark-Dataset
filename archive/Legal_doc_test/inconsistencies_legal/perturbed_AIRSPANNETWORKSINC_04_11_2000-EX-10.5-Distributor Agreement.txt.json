The Invoice specifically will identify the Equipment, Software, or other items shipped, and the Contract Price of such items. Any Installation Services or other services provided by Airspan will be invoiced separately following completion of such services. The Invoice also shall state the total due to Airspan from Distributor (the \"Invoice Total\"), which shall include the Contract Price, and any applicable taxes, duties, and other fees due pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement. Payment of the Invoice Total is due (without any right of set-off) Net forty-five (45) days after the date of invoice.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment term to 'Net ninety (90) days' could contradict state laws concerning prompt payment, especially if the business relationship falls under specific industry regulations that mandate shorter payment cycles. This artificially extends the payment deadline and could potentially harm Airspan's cash flow.",

                "law_explanation": "South Dakota codified laws may have specific requirements related to prompt payment depending on the nature of the business and service provided. While a general 'Net 90' term might not be explicitly illegal, it becomes problematic if it violates sector-specific prompt payment statutes. Prompt Payment Acts vary by state but often govern payment terms for contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers to ensure timely compensation. This change increases the risk of non-compliance with such regulations and shifts financial burden on Airspan.",

Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.",

Distributor will give Airspan five (5) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-compete clause to 12 months after termination and shortening the notice period to 5 days creates a potentially unenforceable restriction under South Dakota law regarding restraint of trade. The extended duration and shortened notice could be deemed unreasonable, limiting the distributor's ability to pursue other business opportunities.",

                "law_explanation": "South Dakota Codified Laws § 53-9-11 states, 'Every contract restraining exercise of a lawful profession, trade, or business is void to that extent, except as provided by §§ 53-9-9 to 53-9-12, inclusive.' This statute restricts overly broad non-compete agreements. Extending the restriction to twelve months after the contract ends, and limiting the notification period to 5 days, could be interpreted as unreasonably restraining the distributor's ability to conduct business, making it legally questionable under South Dakota law. The unreasonableness could stem from the length of the restriction and the short notice period which limits the distributor's ability to fairly negotiate new opportunities.",

                "explanation": "Changing the order acknowledgement timeframe to 15 business days is not directly illegal but could violate the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing under contract law if this delay causes unreasonable hardship or losses to the distributor, especially considering South Dakota's commercial laws.",

                "law_explanation": "While there's no specific statute dictating order acknowledgement timeframes, South Dakota law, like most states, recognizes the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. Extending the acknowledgement timeframe to fifteen business days may violate this covenant if it causes undue hardship or prevents the distributor from effectively planning their sales and operations. The determination would depend on industry standards, the nature of the products, and the specific impact of the delay on the distributor's business. The increase in days could cause significant impacts.",

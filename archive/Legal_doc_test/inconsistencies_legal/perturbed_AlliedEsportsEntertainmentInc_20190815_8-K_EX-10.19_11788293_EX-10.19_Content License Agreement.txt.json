                "explanation": "Changing the reporting deadline from 30 days to 90 days may create inconsistencies, as standard business practice often requires more frequent reporting for accurate and timely financial oversight. Specifically, if WPT requires these reports to pay taxes or make other external filings, this change could result in them not being reported on time. This is more in the scope of general regulatory compliance than an instance that directly violates a statute, but will depend on the context.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the feedback time to 1 business day is unreasonable and unenforceable. This requirement is designed to protect intellectual property rights and ensure that the licensed property is being used and advertised in ways that are in line with brand guidelines.

                "law_explanation": "Requiring Licensor to respond to a creative submission with 'detailed feedback' within just 1 business day, or face automatic approval, is unreasonable and contradicts standard contract law. Courts often consider factors such as the complexity of the task, the resources available, and the industry standards to assess the reasonableness of a deadline. Intellectual property reviews, which can involve intricate legal and brand considerations, often necessitate more than a single business day to be done effectively. A very short turnaround time increases the risk of hasty and poorly considered decisions, undermining the purpose of Licensor's approval rights and potentially leading to trademark infringement or brand dilution.",

                "law_explanation": "Changing the force majeure clause to allow termination with only 24 hours' notice contradicts the spirit, if not the letter, of the WARN Act (29 U.S. Code ยง 2102). While the WARN Act focuses on employers with 100 or more employees and mass layoffs, reducing the notice period to such a short duration could prevent a company from adequately preparing for potential layoffs or closures mandated by unforeseen circumstances. The Act states that in the case of unforeseeable business circumstances, as much notice as is practicable is required. One day's notice does not align with current legal understanding of appropriate 'practicable' notice. Also, given the dependence on revenue and profit indicated in the original agreement, this clause would be likely to affect whether such employees are able to survive these circumstances.",

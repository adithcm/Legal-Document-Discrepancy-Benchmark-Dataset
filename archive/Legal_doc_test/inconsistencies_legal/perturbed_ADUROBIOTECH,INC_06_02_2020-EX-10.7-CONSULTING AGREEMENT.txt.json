                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment deadline to 60 days, which might contradict California labor laws regarding timely payment to independent contractors.",

                "law_explanation": "California Labor Code Section 2751 requires a written contract for independent contractors that includes the rate of pay and method of payment. While not explicitly stating a payment deadline, extending it to 60 days could be deemed unreasonable and potentially conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, depending on industry standards and the nature of the services provided. A 30-day period is a more common and accepted business practice, while doubling that period could be seen as an attempt to delay payments unreasonably.",

                "original_text": "From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "From the Effective Date and for twenty-four (24) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to 24 months might be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under California law, which generally disfavors non-compete agreements, including overly broad non-solicitation clauses.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600",

                "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits contracts that restrain a person from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business. While non-solicitation agreements are not per se invalid, a 24-month restriction, especially without geographic limitations, could be deemed an unreasonable restraint on the Consultant's ability to practice their profession, making it unenforceable under California law. Courts examine the specific facts and circumstances to determine reasonableness, but a longer duration increases the likelihood of unenforceability.",

                "explanation": "Changing the notice requirement to oral notice may contradict California law's Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts, or modifications thereof, to be in writing.",

                "law_explanation": "California Civil Code Section 1624, the Statute of Frauds, requires certain agreements to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. While this consulting agreement itself is already in writing, changing the means of termination to an *oral* agreement may not be enforceable due to the pre-existing written agreement and depending on the agreement's duration and subject matter. This is especially true if the original agreement contained a clause requiring modifications to be in writing.",

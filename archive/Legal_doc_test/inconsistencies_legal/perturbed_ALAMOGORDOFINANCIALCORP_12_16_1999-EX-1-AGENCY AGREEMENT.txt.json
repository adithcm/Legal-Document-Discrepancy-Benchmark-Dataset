                "explanation": "Reducing the termination period to 14 days may contradict requirements for maintaining records and fulfilling regulatory obligations related to securities offerings, as 45 days might be a more reasonable timeframe to fulfill these responsibilities.",

                "law_explanation": "SEC Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers to preserve records for specified periods, potentially longer than 14 days depending on the record type. Reducing the agency agreement's duration could hinder compliance with these record-keeping mandates, as 14 days might be insufficient to complete post-offering tasks and retain necessary documentation.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the lock-up period to 30 days could contradict standard underwriting practices and potentially violate NASD/FINRA rules regarding the distribution of securities, especially if it disrupts market stability after the offering.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.",
                "changed_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) fifteen (15) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the agent's appointment period to 15 days after the offering may contradict regulations related to securities offerings, which often require a longer period for post-offering stabilization and compliance activities. This creates a tight timeline that may be inconsistent with industry standards and regulatory expectations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related SEC Rules",
                "law_citation": "SEA Rule 10b-21",
                "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/240.10b-21",
                "law_explanation": "SEA Rule 10b-21 pertains to short selling in connection with an offering.  The original text is more aligned with the time frame needed to meet regulatory requirements. Shortening the agent's appointment to 15 days would leave less time to take corrective measures in case of any problems, thereby increasing the risk of violating SEC regulations.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Other than in connection with any employee benefit plan or arrangement described in the Prospectus, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Agent, sell or issue, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, any shares of Common Stock other than the Securities for a period of 180 days following the Closing Time.",
                "changed_text": "Other than in connection with any employee benefit plan or arrangement described in the Prospectus, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Agent, sell or issue, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, any shares of Common Stock other than the Securities for a period of 30 days following the Closing Time.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a 180-day lock-up period for the company's stock. Shortening this period to 30 days could conflict with standard underwriting practices and SEC Rule 144, which regulates the resale of restricted and controlled securities. A shorter lock-up period could lead to increased market volatility and potential insider trading concerns.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC Rule 144",
                "law_citation": "17 CFR ยง 230.144",
                "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.144",
                "law_explanation": "SEC Rule 144 requires a holding period before restricted securities can be resold.  While not directly a violation, shortening the lock-up period significantly increases the risk of non-compliance with Rule 144 if insiders or affiliates attempt to sell shares shortly after the offering, impacting market stability.",

                "original_text": "The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement covering a twelve month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158 of the Securities Act Regulations) that will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.",

                "explanation": "Extending the deadline for providing the earnings statement to 180 days contradicts SEC regulations regarding timely financial reporting. This could expose the company to penalties for delayed disclosure of financial information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934 - Rule 10b-5",

                "law_explanation": "Rule 10b-5 prohibits fraudulent activities related to securities. By extending the deadline for making the earnings statement available to shareholders, the company can be deemed to be withholding key financial information which could mislead investors, which makes the company liable for any losses incurred by investors as a result.",

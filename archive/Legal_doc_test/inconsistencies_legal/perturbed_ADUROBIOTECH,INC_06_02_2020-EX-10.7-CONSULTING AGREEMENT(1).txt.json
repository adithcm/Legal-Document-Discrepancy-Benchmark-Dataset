                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within thirty days after receiving the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within sixty days after receiving the invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment period to 60 days, potentially violating California Labor Code Section 2751, which requires timely payment for services rendered. Delayed payment can lead to penalties.",

                "law_explanation": "California Labor Code Section 2751 mandates timely payment of wages. While the exact interpretation of 'timely' depends on the specific arrangement and industry standards, a 60-day delay, especially for a consultant, could be considered unreasonably late and violate the spirit of this law, potentially triggering penalties or legal action.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "From the Effective Date and for twenty-four (24) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to 24 months may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under California Business and Professions Code Section 16600, particularly if the consultant's role does not involve access to critical trade secrets or confidential information. California courts generally disfavor non-solicitation agreements exceeding one year unless narrowly tailored to protect legitimate business interests.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600",

                "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits contracts that restrain someone from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business. While narrow restraints related to trade secrets or protecting confidential information can be permissible, a broad 24-month non-solicitation agreement is likely an unreasonable restraint and could be deemed unenforceable under California law.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time without prior written notice to the other.",
                "explanation": "Removing the written notice requirement before termination could conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in California contracts. Abrupt termination without notice could be considered a breach, especially if it causes foreseeable harm to the other party, such as loss of income or investment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (California Contract Law)",

                "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/good_faith",
                "law_explanation": "Under California law, every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires that neither party do anything that injures the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement. While a contract may allow for termination at will, exercising that right without any notice whatsoever could be seen as a violation of this covenant if it demonstrably harms the other party, as it deprives them of the ability to arrange their affairs accordingly.",

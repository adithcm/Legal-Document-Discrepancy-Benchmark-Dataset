                "original_text": "The Breaching Party shall have sixty (60) days (thirty (30) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within ten (10) days of the end of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment).",
                "changed_text": "The Breaching Party shall have ten (10) days (five (5) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such ten (10) day period (five (5) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the non-breaching Party to be given within two (2) days of the end of such ten (10) day period (five (5) day period for non-payment).",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 60-day cure period for a breach of contract, which is a fairly standard practice. By reducing the cure period to 10 days, and for non-payment to 5 days, the modified text creates an unreasonably short timeframe for the breaching party to rectify the situation, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and good faith in contract law, especially in situations where complex remedies are required. \n\nThe modified text also shortens the period to issue a termination notice to 2 days. This is also highly unusual and potentially detrimental to the breaching party.",

                "law_explanation": "California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. The modified text's extremely short cure periods and termination notice period could be argued as a violation of this covenant, as they do not allow a reasonable opportunity for the breaching party to address the issue, especially given the complexities of commercial agreements. Therefore, the other party could argue that this unreasonably short timeframe is contradictory to what would be considered 'good faith' or fair practice.",

The modified text increases the time for first class mail to fifteen business days and express delivery service to five business days, and shortens the time to change addresses to one business day, which could be deemed unreasonable or insufficient under certain circumstances.",

                "law_explanation": "While this section relates to real property, the principle of 'reasonable notice' is found throughout law. Giving only 1 day written notice to change legal addresses could easily conflict with the principle of reasonable notice, especially if the other party claims that they did not receive critical time-sensitive information because the address was changed without them knowing about it, due to the lack of reasonable time.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides for a reasonable notice period (to allow preparation), requires a mutually acceptable auditor, and limits the audit to normal business hours. The modification drastically reduces the notice period to 5 days, removes Aimmune's right to approve the auditor, and allows audits at any time, making the process burdensome and potentially disruptive to Aimmune's operations. This creates a conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and potentially violates California Code of Civil Procedure regarding reasonable business practices.",

The modified audit clause, with its short notice, unilateral auditor selection, and unrestricted timing, could be argued as a violation of this covenant. It creates an opportunity for Xencor to conduct overly intrusive or harassing audits, potentially disrupting Aimmune's business operations without a legitimate business justification, therefore, undermining good faith practices.",

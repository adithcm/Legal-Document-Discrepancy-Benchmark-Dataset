                "original_text": "4.1 PRODUCT WARRANTY. With respect to Qwik-Fix Pro delivered by PivX to Detto on CD-Rom, PivX warrants that for a period of thirty (30) days following delivery to Detto, the media on which Qwik-Fix Pro is furnished to Detto will be free from defects in materials and workmanship during normal use. PivX warrants that Qwik-Fix Pro will substantially conform to the user documentation. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, QWIK-FIX PRO AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\". PIVX HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.",
                "changed_text": "6.6 GENERAL. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Detto is an independent contractor, and nothing herein shall be construed to create an employer-employee, partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between the parties. Detto shall have no authority, right or power to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of PivX. 4.1 PRODUCT WARRANTY. With respect to Qwik-Fix Pro delivered by PivX to Detto on CD-Rom, PivX warrants that for a period of thirty (30) days following delivery to Detto, the media on which Qwik-Fix Pro is furnished to Detto will be free from defects in materials and workmanship during normal use.

                "explanation": "Moving the warranty disclaimer to the 'General' section buries it, making it less conspicuous and harder for Detto to find. Warranty disclaimers are typically expected in sections explicitly addressing warranty, liability, or product specifications, not a miscellaneous section covering general legal principles.",

                "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/316",
                "law_explanation": "UCC ยง 2-316 requires that disclaimers of the implied warranty of merchantability must be conspicuous. Placing it in a general provision makes it less conspicuous, potentially violating the UCC. The UCC sets rules for commercial transactions, including how warranties can be disclaimed. By moving the product warranty to the 'General' section makes it hard to find, and thus less conspicuous than required by law.",

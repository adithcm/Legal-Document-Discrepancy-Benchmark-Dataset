In cooperation with Airspan, identify potential customers and project opportunities within the Territory that will lead to sales/licenses of Airspan Products and services; b. Prepare reports on the opportunities that will include: (1) description of the project; (2) assessment of the appropriate fit to Airspan Products and services; (3) dollar size and timing of the project; (4) competitive assessment; and (5) identification of key decision makers and other technical and commercial contacts; c. Assist and advise Airspan in the preparation and delivery of appropriate marketing and sales programs; d. Initiate and coordinate meetings at all levels for the appropriate Airspan employees to evaluate the identified projects; e. Initiate and assist in the preparation of sales and technical meetings with customers, and where appropriate, attend these meetings with Airspan personnel and provide administrative support and translation services.

                "law_explanation": "While parties can generally choose the governing law, the choice must be made in good faith and be readily ascertainable. Hiding the choice of law in a service-related section undermines its transparency, increasing the chances of it being challenged as not reasonably communicated or understood, which goes against the spirit of contract law and the expectations of conflict of laws principles."

Burying a key provision like a limitation of liability clause in an unexpected section of the contract, such as one detailing the appointment of the distributor, can contribute to a finding of procedural unconscionability, especially if the distributor wasn't given a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms."

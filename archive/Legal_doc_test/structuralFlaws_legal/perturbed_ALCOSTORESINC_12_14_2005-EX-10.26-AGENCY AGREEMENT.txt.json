                "explanation": "This change moves the disclosure that Duckwall-Alco is acting as an agent for General Electric Capital Corporation to a section where it is discussing commitments to execute equipment schedules, therefore making it difficult to easily establish the agency relationship. By relocating agency disclosure to irrelevant locations, makes it more difficult to understand the agent's role and authority.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification obscures the agency relationship by moving a disclosure related to it to an unrelated part of the contract, which contradicts the principle of clear disclosure of agency, therefore making it difficult to establish the agent's role and authority.",

Also, all invoices should reference the appropriate Purchase Order/Sales Agreement Number. General Electric Capital Corporation will also require a complete set of Lease documentation prior to funding. These documents may include a Schedule and a Certificate of Acceptance.

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit requirement for i-Escrow to comply with California Escrow Law and weakens the standard to 'reasonable efforts'. It also removes the clause ensuring that California Escrow Law prevails in case of conflict. This introduces legal risk because it potentially allows i-Escrow to operate outside the bounds of mandatory consumer protections provided by California law.",

By weakening the obligation to comply with California Escrow Law, this contract potentially circumvents these mandatory consumer protections, allowing i-Escrow to operate with less stringent financial safeguards.",

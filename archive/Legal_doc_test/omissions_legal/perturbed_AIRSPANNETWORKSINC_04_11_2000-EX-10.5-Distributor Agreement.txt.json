                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\" the contract attempts to disclaim implied warranties, which may be restricted or unenforceable under South Dakota law, specifically the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in South Dakota. This creates legal risk as implied warranties provide certain baseline protections to the distributor.",
                "contradicted_law": "South Dakota Codified Laws Chapter 57A-2 - Sales, specifically sections addressing implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.",

                "law_explanation": "SDCL 57A-2-314 establishes the implied warranty of merchantability, ensuring goods are fit for ordinary purposes. SDCL 57A-2-315 establishes the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. While disclaimers are possible, they must be conspicuous and meet certain requirements. Removing the explicit mention of these warranties creates ambiguity and a higher risk of the disclaimer being deemed unenforceable, violating the spirit and intent of the UCC provisions as adopted in South Dakota.",

Airspan will be responsible for and pay all packing, shipping, freight, and insurance charges to the agreed upon location within the city limits.",
                "changed_text": "8.1 All Equipment and Software will be delivered to an airport in South Dakota.  Distributor will be responsible for all packing, shipping, freight, and insurance charges.",
                "explanation": "By shifting the responsibility of packing, shipping, freight, and insurance charges to the distributor, the contract could potentially violate the UCC provisions related to risk of loss and delivery terms if not explicitly and conspicuously agreed upon. This creates a legal risk, as South Dakota law provides default rules for these aspects of a sale.",

                "law_explanation": "These sections of the South Dakota UCC address the meaning of delivery terms (e.g., FOB, CIF) and the passage of risk of loss. By removing the specific Incoterms reference and shifting all responsibility to the distributor, the contract deviates from standard commercial practice and may be interpreted in a way that is unfavorable to the distributor and inconsistent with the implied obligations under the UCC if the distributor is not made aware that they are agreeing to very onerous terms.",

The Invoice specifically will identify the Equipment, Software, or other items shipped, and the Contract Price of such items. Any Installation Services or other services provided by Airspan will be invoiced separately following completion of such services. The Invoice also shall state the total due to Airspan from Distributor (the \"Invoice Total\"), which shall include the Contract Price, and any applicable taxes, duties, and other fees due pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement. Payment of the Invoice Total is due (without any right of set-off) Net forty-five (45) days after the date of invoice.",
                "changed_text": "7.1 Airspan will issue an invoice (the \"Invoice\") to Distributor in accordance with the payment terms below.  Payment of the Invoice Total is due at Airspan's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the net forty-five (45) day payment term and replacing it with 'Airspan's discretion', the contract becomes vague and potentially unconscionable. This introduces a legal risk as it fails to define payment terms clearly, contradicting principles of good faith and fair dealing implied under contract law and the UCC in South Dakota.",
                "contradicted_law": "South Dakota Codified Laws Chapter 57A-2 - Sales and general contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "law_url": "https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=57A-1-304",
                "law_explanation": "SDCL 57A-1-304 imposes an obligation of good faith in the performance and enforcement of contracts under the UCC.  Leaving payment terms entirely to Airspan's discretion raises concerns about whether Airspan would act in good faith. This could lead to legal challenges based on breach of contract or unconscionability.",

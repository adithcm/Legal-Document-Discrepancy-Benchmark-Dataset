                "original_text": "The Joint Venturers shall maintain adequate books and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All direct costs and expenses, which shall include any insurance costs in connection with the distribution of the Products or operations of the Joint Venture, or if the business of the Joint Venture requires additional office facilities than those now presently maintained by each Joint Venturer, such item shall be paid by the Joint Venture.",
                "changed_text": "The Joint Venturers shall maintain books and records of the Joint Venture activities and affairs conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit mention of including insurance costs as direct expenses. Pennsylvania law mandates that businesses maintain adequate insurance coverage for their operations, and allocating these costs to the joint venture is crucial. By omitting the mention of insurance costs, there's a potential loophole where the joint venture might neglect adequate insurance, violating business regulations.",

By removing the explicit mention of insurance costs as a direct expense, the Joint Venture might fail to prioritize adequate insurance, thus contradicting the spirit and potentially the letter of Pennsylvania insurance law.",

Pennsylvania law requires transparency and access to company records for stakeholders. By omitting the accessibility clause, the contract creates a legal risk by potentially violating Pennsylvania's regulations concerning corporate transparency and stakeholder rights.",

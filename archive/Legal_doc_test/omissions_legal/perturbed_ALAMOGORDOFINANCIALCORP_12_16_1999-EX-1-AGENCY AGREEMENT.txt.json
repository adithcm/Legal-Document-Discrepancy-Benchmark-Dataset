                "explanation": "Removing the guarantee that deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits contradicts federal regulations that mandate FDIC insurance for banks. This removal introduces legal risk by misleading potential investors about the safety of deposits.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Deposit Insurance Act",

                "changed_text": "The Company may furnish to its shareholders an annual report of the Company.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to furnish shareholders with an annual report and by omitting the specific requirement that the report includes a consolidated balance sheet and other statements certified by independent public accountants introduces a legal contradiction with securities regulations that aim to protect shareholder rights through regular disclosures. This omission increases legal risk by reducing transparency and potentially concealing important financial information from shareholders.",

                "changed_text": "The Company may list the Shares on a securities exchange or on the Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq\").",
                "explanation": "Removing the commitment to 'use its best efforts' to 'encourage and assist a market maker' and 'maintain quotation' weakens the company's obligation to ensure liquidity for the shares. This could negatively affect shareholders' ability to trade the stock and creates legal risk because it reduces transparency and market accessibility.",

        "original_text": "Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\"). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent, if any, that Consultant has rights in or to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (\"Aduro IP\"), Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to Aduro, and to the extent that an executory assignment is not enforceable, Consultant hereby agrees to assign and transfer to Aduro, in writing, from time to time, upon request, any and all right, title, or interest that Consultant has or may obtain in any Work Product and/or Aduro IP without the necessity of further consideration. Aduro shall be entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto. At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product. Such assistance may include, but will not be limited to, signing applications and other documents, cooperating in legal proceedings, and taking any other steps considered necessary or desirable by Aduro.",
        "changed_text": "Aduro shall be the owner of the physical embodiments of any writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\"). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro.  At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in physically transferring any Work Product.",
        "explanation": "This change removes the assignment of intellectual property rights (copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks) to Aduro, and limits Aduro's ownership to physical embodiments of the Work Product. It removes the section where consultant irrevocably assigns and transfers all rights to Aduro, creating a legal contradiction in California where intellectual property assignment is heavily regulated and this clause is often used to ensure IP transfer.",

        "law_explanation": "California Labor Code Section 2870 limits the scope of agreements requiring employees to assign rights in their inventions to their employers. By removing the explicit assignment of intellectual property and limiting Aduro's ownership, the modified text creates ambiguity regarding the ownership of intellectual property developed by the consultant, potentially contradicting the intent and protections afforded under California law. The original text was structured to proactively ensure IP assignment, while the edited text does not make clear about all intellectual property rights, thereby weakening protection under California law.",

(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either: (1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or (2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer. (b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.

        "explanation": "While parties can generally agree on a choice of law, certain California laws are considered so fundamental to public policy that they apply to contracts performed in California, regardless of the choice of law provision.

        "law_explanation": "This section states that certain construction contracts cannot waive California law with respect to work performed in California. While this contract is not for construction, it demonstrates the principle that California law can override choice of law provisions when strong public policy considerations are present. Switching to Delaware law could weaken protections for the consultant that would otherwise be afforded under California law, where the services are presumably performed.",

(a) The following provisions of a contract between the contractor and a subcontractor with principal offices in this state, for the construction of a public or private work of improvement in this state, shall be void and unenforceable: (1) A provision which purports to require any dispute between the parties to be litigated, arbitrated, or otherwise determined outside this state. (2) A provision which purports to preclude a party from commencing such a proceeding or obtaining a judgment or other resolution in this state or the courts of this state.

        "original_text": "In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief. Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.",
        "changed_text": "In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief.",
        "explanation": "This change removes the clause allowing Aduro to recover direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, and/or punitive damages in the event of a breach of the non-solicitation agreement. This weakens the remedies available to Aduro, potentially making the non-solicitation agreement less effective and less compliant with the spirit of California's Business and Professions Code regarding unfair competition.",

        "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 prohibits unfair competition. While this section doesn't explicitly mandate specific damages, it provides a broad framework for addressing unfair business practices, including employee solicitation. By limiting Aduro's remedies to injunctive relief only, the contract might be seen as unduly restricting the company's ability to address unfair competition resulting from a breach of the non-solicitation agreement, going against the spirit of California's law.",

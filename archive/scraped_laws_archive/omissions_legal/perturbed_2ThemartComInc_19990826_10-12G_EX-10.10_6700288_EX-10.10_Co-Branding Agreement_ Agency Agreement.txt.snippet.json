Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",

        "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit requirement for i-Escrow to comply with California Escrow Law and weakens the standard to 'reasonable efforts'. It also removes the clause ensuring that California Escrow Law prevails in case of conflict. This introduces legal risk because it potentially allows i-Escrow to operate outside the bounds of mandatory consumer protections provided by California law.",

(a) At the time of filing an application for an escrow agent’s license, the applicant shall deposit with the commissioner a bond satisfactory to the commissioner in the amount of at least twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). Thereafter, a licensee shall maintain a bond satisfactory to the commissioner in the amount of: (1) twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) if 150 percent of the previous year’s average annual trust fund obligations, as calculated under Section 17348, equals two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) or less; (2) thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) if 150 percent of the previous year’s average annual trust fund obligations, as calculated under Section 17348, equals at least two hundred fifty thousand one dollars ($250,001) but not more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000); or (3) fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) if 150 percent of the previous year’s average annual trust fund obligations, as calculated under Section 17348, equals five hundred thousand one dollars ($500,001) or more. The bond shall run to the state for the use of the state and for any person who has cause against the obligor of the bond under the provision of this division. A deposit given instead of the bond required by this section shall not be deemed an asset of the applicant or licensee for the purpose of complying with Section 17210. An applicant or licensee may obtain an irrevocable letter of credit approved by the commissioner in lieu of the bond. (b) Escrow agents licensed prior to January 1, 1986, shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (a) on or before July 1, 1986. (Amended by Stats. 1985, Ch. 1560, Sec. 2.

(a) Everyone is responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her property or person, except so far as the latter has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or herself. The design, distribution, or marketing of firearms and ammunition is not exempt from the duty to use ordinary care and skill that is required by this section. The extent of liability in these cases is defined by the Title on Compensatory Relief. (b) It is the intent of the Legislature to abrogate the holdings in cases such as Vesely v. Sager (1971) 5 Cal.3d 153, Bernhard v. Harrah’s Club (1976) 16 Cal.3d 313, and Coulter v. Superior Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 144 and to reinstate the prior judicial interpretation of this section as it relates to proximate cause for injuries incurred as a result of furnishing alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person, namely that the furnishing of alcoholic beverages is not the proximate cause of injuries resulting from intoxication, but rather the consumption of alcoholic beverages is the proximate cause of injuries inflicted upon another by an intoxicated person. (c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), no social host who furnishes alcoholic beverages to any person may be held legally accountable for damages suffered by that person, or for injury to the person or property of, or death of, any third person, resulting from the consumption of those beverages. (d) (1) Nothing in subdivision (c) shall preclude a claim against a parent, guardian, or another adult who knowingly furnishes alcoholic beverages at his or her residence to a person whom he or she knows, or should have known, to be under 21 years of age, in which case, notwithstanding subdivision (b), the furnishing of the alcoholic beverage may be found to be the proximate cause of resulting injuries or death. (2) A claim under this subdivision may be brought by, or on behalf of, the person under 21 years of age or by a person who was harmed by the person under 21 years of age.

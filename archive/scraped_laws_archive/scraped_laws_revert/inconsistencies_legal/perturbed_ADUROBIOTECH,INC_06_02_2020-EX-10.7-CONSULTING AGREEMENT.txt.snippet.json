        "law_explanation": "California Labor Code Section 2751 requires a written contract for independent contractors that includes the rate of pay and method of payment. While not explicitly stating a payment deadline, extending it to 60 days could be deemed unreasonable and potentially conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, depending on industry standards and the nature of the services provided. A 30-day period is a more common and accepted business practice, while doubling that period could be seen as an attempt to delay payments unreasonably.",

EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS [2700 - 3122.4] ( Division 3 enacted by Stats. 1937, Ch. 90. ) CHAPTER 2. Employer and Employee [2750 - 2930] ( Chapter 2 enacted by Stats. 1937, Ch. 90. ) ARTICLE 1. The Contract of Employment [2750 - 2755] ( Article 1 enacted by Stats. 1937, Ch. 90. ) 2751. (a) Whenever an employer enters into a contract of employment with an employee for services to be rendered within this state and the contemplated method of payment of the employee involves commissions, the contract shall be in writing and shall set forth the method by which the commissions shall be computed and paid. (b) The employer shall give a signed copy of the contract to every employee who is a party thereto and shall obtain a signed receipt for the contract from each employee. In the case of a contract that expires and where the parties nevertheless continue to work under the terms of the expired contract, the contract terms are presumed to remain in full force and effect until the contract is superseded or employment is terminated by either party. (c) As used in this section, “commissions” has the meaning set forth in Section 204.1. For purposes of this section only, “commission” does not include any of the following: (1) Short-term productivity bonuses such as are paid to retail clerks. (2) Temporary, variable incentive payments that increase, but do not decrease, payment under the written contract. (3) Bonus and profit-sharing plans, unless there has been an offer by the employer to pay a fixed percentage of sales or profits as compensation for work to be performed.

While non-solicitation agreements are not per se invalid, a 24-month restriction, especially without geographic limitations, could be deemed an unreasonable restraint on the Consultant's ability to practice their profession, making it unenforceable under California law. Courts examine the specific facts and circumstances to determine reasonableness, but a longer duration increases the likelihood of unenforceability.",

Arthur Andersen LLP (2008) 44 Cal.4th 937, to void the application of any noncompete agreement in an employment context, or any noncompete clause in an employment contract, no matter how narrowly tailored, that does not satisfy an exception in this chapter.

(2) A special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another, except in the cases provided for in Section 2794. (3) An agreement for the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the sale of real property, or of an interest therein; such an agreement, if made by an agent of the party sought to be charged, is invalid, unless the authority of the agent is in writing, subscribed by the party sought to be charged.

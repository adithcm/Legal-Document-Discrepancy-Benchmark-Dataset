Beginning on the Launch Date and continuing throughout the Term, Distributor shall ensure that [ * ]Distributor App distributed by or on behalf of Distributor is bundled with the Distribution Products as set out in this Agreement.",
        "changed_text": "Distributor shall endeavor to begin distribution of Bundles in accordance with this Agreement (\"Launch\") within a reasonable timeframe following the Effective Date (the date of such Launch, the \"Launch Date\"). Beginning on the Launch Date and continuing throughout the Term, Distributor should aim to ensure that a significant portion of Distributor Apps distributed by or on behalf of Distributor is bundled with the Distribution Products as set out in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall begin distribution' with 'shall endeavor to begin distribution within a reasonable timeframe,' making the obligation to start distribution less definitive. 'Reasonable timeframe' is subjective and lacks a clear deadline. Furthermore, changing 'shall ensure that' to 'should aim to ensure that a significant portion' weakens the commitment to bundling, introducing further uncertainty about the extent of compliance. This creates a vague legal obligation.",

        "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contract",
        "law_explanation": "By replacing 'shall' with weaker, subjective terms like 'endeavor' and 'reasonable timeframe,' the contract creates ambiguity that makes it difficult to prove a breach of contract due to failure to perform a specific action within a defined timeframe. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 235 states that when performance of a duty under a contract is due any non-performance is a breach. The modified language makes it harder to enforce a specific performance date.",

        "scraped_snippet": "contract | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you contract A contract is an agreement between parties , creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law . The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent , expressed by a valid offer and acceptance ; adequate consideration ; capacity ; and legality . In some states , elements of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. Possible remedies for breach of contract include general damages , consequential damages , reliance damages , and specific performance . Background : Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. Contract law is generally governed by state common law , and while general overall contract law is common throughout the country, some specific court interpretations of a particular element of the contract may vary between the states. If a promise is breached, the law provides remedies to the harmed party, often in the form of monetary damages, or in limited circumstances, in the form of specific performance of the promise made. Elements -- Consideration and Mutual Assent Contracts arise when a duty comes into existence, because of a promise made by one of the parties. To be legally binding as a contract, a promise must be exchanged for adequate consideration. There are two different theories or definitions of consideration: Bargain Theory of Consideration and Benefit-Detriment theory of consideration. Benefit-Detriment Under the b enefit-detriment theory, an adequate consideration exists only when a promise made to the benefit of the promisor or to the detriment of the promisee, which reasonably and fairly induces the promisor to make a promise for something else for the promisee. For example, promises that are purely gifts are not considered enforceable because the personal satisfaction the grantor of the promise may receive from the act of generosity is normally not considered sufficient detriment to constitute adequate consideration. Bargain-for-Exchange Under Bargain-for-Exchange theory of consideration, adequate consideration exists when a promisor makes a promise in return for something else. Here, the essential condition is that the promisor was given something specifically to induce the promise being made. In other words, the bargain for exchange theory is different from the detriment-benefit theory in that the focus in bargain for exchange theory seems to be the parties’ motive for making the promises and the parties’ subjective mutual assent, while in detriment benefit theory, the focus seems to be an objective legal detriment or benefit to the parties. Governing Laws Contracts are mainly governed by state statutory and common (judge-made) law and private law (i.e. the private agreement). Private law principally includes the terms of the agreement between the parties who are exchanging promises. This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. Statutory law, such as the Statute of Fraud , may require some kinds of contracts be put in writing and executed with particular formalities, for the contract to be enforceable. Otherwise, the parties may enter into a binding agreement without signing a formal written document. For example, Virginia Supreme Court has held in Lucy v. Zehmer that even an agreement made on a piece of napkin can be considered a valid contract, if the parties were both sane, and showed mutual assent and consideration. Most of the principles of the common law of contracts are outlined in the Restatement of Law, Second Contracts published by the American Law Institute. The Uniform Commercial Code , whose original articles have been adopted in nearly every state, represents a body of statutory law that governs important categories of contracts. The main articles that deal with the law of contracts are Article 1 (General Provisions) and Article 2 (Sales) . Sections of Article 9 ("

        "changed_text": "Google may attempt to deliver the Distribution Products electronically to Distributor in a timely manner following the Effective Date and prior to Launch (as defined in Clause 3.4 (Launch)).",
        "explanation": "This change significantly weakens Google's obligation to deliver the distribution products. 'Shall deliver' is replaced with 'may attempt to deliver,' making the delivery discretionary rather than mandatory. The addition of 'in a timely manner' introduces a vague timeframe that is subject to interpretation, conflicting with the need for a clear delivery schedule. ",

        "explanation": "This change weakens the restriction on modifying the Products and inserting malicious code. Replacing 'shall accurately reproduce' with 'should endeavor to accurately reproduce' softens the obligation. Adding qualifiers like 'modifying the core functionality' and 'in a way that fundamentally alters its intended use' introduces subjectivity. Similarly, limiting the prohibition to 'known viruses' and requiring definitive proof of harm weakens the protection against malicious code. This makes it harder to enforce these restrictions.",

        "explanation": "The terms 'endeavor to maintain' and 'considers necessary' introduce ambiguity and discretion, weakening the obligation to provide continuous service. The original clause mandated continuous operation except for 'reasonable' maintenance, a standard generally understood. This change makes uptime discretionary and subjective.",

        "law_explanation": "By significantly weakening the guarantee of continuous service through vague language like 'endeavor' and granting itself broad discretion over maintenance ('considers necessary'), i-on is arguably engaging in a deceptive practice if the service uptime is drastically reduced without clear and conspicuous disclosure. FDUTPA prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce. The changes introduce an ambiguity that could mislead customers regarding the reliability of the service.",

        "explanation": "This modification removes the objective standard of 'proper environmental conditions' and 'reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access,' replacing it with vague assurances.

        "law_explanation": "While this agreement predates the Act, it's prudent to consider. The original clause had an element of control for physical access, where the new wording removes this control. The FIPA requires businesses to take reasonable measures to protect sensitive personal information. By reducing the obligation to simply 'efforts will be made,' without defining what constitutes those efforts, i-on potentially fails to meet the 'reasonable measures' standard if a data breach occurs due to inadequate physical security. The lack of specifics makes it difficult to assess compliance.",

Good faith access of personal information by an employee or agent of the covered entity does not constitute a breach of security, provided that the information is not used for a purpose unrelated to the business or subject to further unauthorized use. (b) “Covered entity” means a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, or other commercial entity that acquires, maintains, stores, or uses personal information. For purposes of the notice requirements in subsections (3)-(6), the term includes a governmental entity. (c) “Customer records” means any material, regardless of the physical form, on which personal information is recorded or preserved by any means, including, but not limited to, written or spoken words, graphically depicted, printed, or electromagnetically transmitted that are provided by an individual in this state to a covered entity for the purpose of purchasing or leasing a product or obtaining a service. (d) “Data in electronic form” means any data stored electronically or digitally on any computer system or other database and includes recordable tapes and other mass storage devices. (e) “Department” means the Department of Legal Affairs. (f) “Governmental entity” means any department, division, bureau, commission, regional planning agency, board, district, authority, agency, or other instrumentality of this state that acquires, maintains, stores, or uses data in electronic form containing personal information. (g)1. “Personal information” means either of the following: a.

        "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'should generally be mindful' drastically weakens the customer's obligation to adhere to legal and regulatory requirements.

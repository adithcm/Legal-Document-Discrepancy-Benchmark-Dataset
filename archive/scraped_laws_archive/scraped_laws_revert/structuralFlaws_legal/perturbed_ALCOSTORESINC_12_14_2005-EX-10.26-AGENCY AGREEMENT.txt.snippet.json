        "scraped_snippet": "agency | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you agency Agency law is a common law doctrine controlling relationships between agents and principals . A principal-agent relationship is created when the agent is given authority to act on behalf of the principal. An agreement made by an agent is binding on the principal so long as the agreement was within the authority actually granted to the agent or reasonably perceived by a third party . The two forms of actual authority include: Express authority : An agent has express authority to take any actions requested by the principal as well as authority to take any actions inherently necessary to accomplish those requests. Implied authority : An agent has implied authority to take any action the principal’s conduct indicates the agent should do. Furthermore, failure by the principal to object to an agent’s prior actions may create implied authority to repeat those actions in the future. An agent does not have implied authority to do anything expressly prohibited by the principal. In addition to actual authority, a principal may be bound by the actions of an agent if apparent authority existed. Apparent authority : An agent has apparent authority when, despite no existing authority, a third party reasonably infers that someone is authorized to act on the principal’s behalf due to the conduct of the principal. Unlike actual authority, a principal can be bound by an agent’s act made with apparent authority even if they explicitly stated that the agent could not do that act. Furthermore, a person possessing a widely recognized title like Hiring Director has apparent authority to accomplish anything a reasonable person would believe that title entails. An agent acting with apparent authority is known as an ostensible agent . Additionally, principals can be held liable for the torts of their agents under the doctrine of vicarious liability . A principal is always liable for torts committed while the agent completes their official responsibilities. For torts occurring outside of official duties , the liability of the principal depends on whether the agent’s tort occurred during a frolic or a detour. A principal is liable for the “detours” of their agent but not for the “frolics.” The primary considerations many courts use to determine if an act was a frolic or a detour include how much control the principal exerts over the agent’s actions and who economically benefits from the agent’s actions.

        "scraped_snippet": "contract | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you contract A contract is an agreement between parties , creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law . The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent , expressed by a valid offer and acceptance ; adequate consideration ; capacity ; and legality . In some states , elements of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. Possible remedies for breach of contract include general damages , consequential damages , reliance damages , and specific performance . Background : Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. Contract law is generally governed by state common law , and while general overall contract law is common throughout the country, some specific court interpretations of a particular element of the contract may vary between the states. If a promise is breached, the law provides remedies to the harmed party, often in the form of monetary damages, or in limited circumstances, in the form of specific performance of the promise made. Elements -- Consideration and Mutual Assent Contracts arise when a duty comes into existence, because of a promise made by one of the parties. To be legally binding as a contract, a promise must be exchanged for adequate consideration. There are two different theories or definitions of consideration: Bargain Theory of Consideration and Benefit-Detriment theory of consideration. Benefit-Detriment Under the b enefit-detriment theory, an adequate consideration exists only when a promise made to the benefit of the promisor or to the detriment of the promisee, which reasonably and fairly induces the promisor to make a promise for something else for the promisee. For example, promises that are purely gifts are not considered enforceable because the personal satisfaction the grantor of the promise may receive from the act of generosity is normally not considered sufficient detriment to constitute adequate consideration. Bargain-for-Exchange Under Bargain-for-Exchange theory of consideration, adequate consideration exists when a promisor makes a promise in return for something else. Here, the essential condition is that the promisor was given something specifically to induce the promise being made. In other words, the bargain for exchange theory is different from the detriment-benefit theory in that the focus in bargain for exchange theory seems to be the parties’ motive for making the promises and the parties’ subjective mutual assent, while in detriment benefit theory, the focus seems to be an objective legal detriment or benefit to the parties. Governing Laws Contracts are mainly governed by state statutory and common (judge-made) law and private law (i.e. the private agreement). Private law principally includes the terms of the agreement between the parties who are exchanging promises. This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. Statutory law, such as the Statute of Fraud , may require some kinds of contracts be put in writing and executed with particular formalities, for the contract to be enforceable. Otherwise, the parties may enter into a binding agreement without signing a formal written document. For example, Virginia Supreme Court has held in Lucy v. Zehmer that even an agreement made on a piece of napkin can be considered a valid contract, if the parties were both sane, and showed mutual assent and consideration. Most of the principles of the common law of contracts are outlined in the Restatement of Law, Second Contracts published by the American Law Institute. The Uniform Commercial Code , whose original articles have been adopted in nearly every state, represents a body of statutory law that governs important categories of contracts. The main articles that deal with the law of contracts are Article 1 (General Provisions) and Article 2 (Sales) . Sections of Article 9 ("

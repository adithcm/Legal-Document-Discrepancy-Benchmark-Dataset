        "original_text": "18.08. The Parties agree that any action brought by either Party against the other in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the State of Texas in the judicial district in which AIRSOPURE has its principal place of business and do hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
        "changed_text": "11.04. Should You, for any reason, fail to procure or maintain the insurance required by this Agreement, AIRSOPURE shall have the right and authority (without, however, any obligation to do so) immediately to procure such insurance and to charge same to You, which charges, together with a reasonable fee for AIRSOPURE's expenses in so acting, shall be payable by You immediately upon notice. AIRSOPURE is not a licensed insurance agent or agency. 18.08. The Parties agree that any action brought by either Party against the other in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the State of Texas in the judicial district in which AIRSOPURE has its principal place of business and do hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
        "explanation": "The jurisdiction and venue clause, which dictates where legal disputes must be resolved, is moved from the 'General Provisions' section to the 'Insurance' section. This is an unexpected location for such a clause, making it less likely to be noticed by a franchisee. This could lead to disputes over jurisdiction if the franchisee is not aware that they have agreed to litigate in Texas.",

        "law_explanation": "While parties can agree to a forum selection clause, 28 U.S. Code § 1404 allows a court to transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice. Hiding the forum selection clause in an unexpected section might influence a party not being aware of this agreement, which might influence the decision to request a change of venue.",

(b) Upon motion, consent or stipulation of all parties, any action, suit or proceeding of a civil nature or any motion or hearing thereof, may be transferred, in the discretion of the court, from the division in which pending to any other division in the same district . Transfer of proceedings in rem brought by or on behalf of the United States may be transferred under this section without the consent of the United States where all other parties request transfer. (c) A district court may order any civil action to be tried at any place within the division in which it is pending. (d) Transfers from a district court of the United States to the District Court of Guam, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, or the District Court of the Virgin Islands shall not be permitted under this section. As otherwise used in this section, the term “ district court ” includes the District Court of Guam, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands, and the term “district” includes the territorial jurisdiction of each such court.

L. 112–63, title II, § 204 , Dec. 7, 2011 , 125 Stat. 764 .) Historical and Revision Notes Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 119 , 163 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 58, 36 Stat. 1103 ; Sept. 8, 1916, ch. 475, § 5, 39 Stat. 851 ). Section consolidates sections 119 and 163 of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology and substance. Section 119 of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to transfer of cases from one division to another on stipulation of the parties. Subsection (a) was drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens, permitting transfer to a more convenient forum, even though the venue is proper. As an example of the need of such a provision, see Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Kepner, 1941, 62 S.Ct. 6, 314 U.S. 44 , 86 L.Ed. 28, which was prosecuted under the Federal Employer’s Liability Act in New York, although the accident occurred and the employee resided in Ohio. The new subsection requires the court to determine that the transfer is necessary for convenience of the parties and witnesses, and further, that it is in the interest of justice to do so. Sections 143 , 172 , 177 , and 181 of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the district courts of Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, and Ohio, contained special provisions similar to subsection (b), applicable to those States. To establish uniformity, the general language of such subsection has been drafted and the special provisions of those sections omitted. Subsection (b) is based upon section 163 of title 28 , U.S.C., 1940 ed., which applied only to the district of Maine. This revised subsection extends to all judicial districts and permits transfer of cases between divisions. Criminal cases may be transferred pursuant to Rules 19–21 of the new Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the criminal provisions of said section 163 are therefore omitted. Editorial Notes Amendments 2011—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 112–63, § 204(1) , inserted “or to any district or division to which all parties have consented” before period at end. Subsec. (d). Pub.

You shall pay to AIRSOPURE an initial franchise fee of $25,000.00 upon execution of this Agreement.

You must find a suitable Center site within 90 days of signing the Franchise Agreement, unless we mutually agree otherwise. If we cannot agree on a Center location, within 4 months, we may a) extend your search time, b) exchange your territory, or c) terminate your Franchise and refund up to 70% of your Franchise Fee, at our sole discretion. There are no refunds under any other circumstances. 18.07.

        "explanation": "The choice of law clause is moved from the 'General Provisions' section to the 'Fees' section. This is an illogical placement that could make it difficult for the franchisee to quickly identify which state's laws govern the agreement. It could be argued that the law surrounding fees could be interpreted under Texas law, while other aspects of the contract might fall under the laws of another jurisdiction.",

        "explanation": "The attorney's fees clause is moved from the 'General Provisions' section to the 'Your Duties' section. This section discusses the franchisee's responsibilities, and it's not logical to expect a provision about attorney's fees to be located there. This misplacement can make it less apparent that the franchisee may be responsible for the franchisor's legal fees if the franchisor wins a dispute. Additionally, attorney fee clauses are supposed to be easily identified and agreed upon by the parties, so it could be harder to show the intent to be bound.",

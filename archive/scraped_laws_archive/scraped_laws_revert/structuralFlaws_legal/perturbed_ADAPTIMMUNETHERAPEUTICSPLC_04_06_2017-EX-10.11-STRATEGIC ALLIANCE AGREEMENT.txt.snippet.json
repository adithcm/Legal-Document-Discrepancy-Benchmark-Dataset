        "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
        "original_text": "1.3 Adaptimmune agrees to commit funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the term (\"Alliance Funding\"). The JSC may allocate and/or re-allocate funds to Studies as necessary and agreed by JSC. The basic per patient estimate for Clinical Studies is as follows: for screening Clinical Studies: $***, for long term follow-up Clinical Studies: $*** and for other Clinical Studies: $***. If the Parties extend the term by mutual agreement as set forth herein, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith the amount of future Study funding commitments by Adaptimmune applicable to such extended term. In the event a Study is terminated early, then in relation to any funds allocated to such Study, the Parties shall promptly discuss and agree upon a replacement of that Study with a new study of similar scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties and that is approved by the JSC, and that will be funded by the Alliance Funding. If there is any Alliance Funding at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, it will be allocated to studies, research or tests agreed by the JSC, and such Alliance Funding will be payable in accordance with agreed milestones relevant to such agreed studies, research or tests. The Parties understand that the compensation being paid to MD Anderson under this Agreement constitutes the fair market value of the services to be provided hereunder. Neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator shall seek or accept reimbursement from any third-party payor for any Study items or procedures supplied by or paid for by Adaptimmune under this Agreement. MD Anderson acknowledges that Adaptimmune may be obligated to disclose all payments made hereunder, including the provision of non-monetary items of value, as may be required under Applicable Law, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, passed as Section 6002 of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, agrees to keep and maintain relevant records of such and, upon Adaptimmune's reasonable request, provide such records to Adaptimmune to the extent such information is not already in Adaptimmune's possession, but only to the extent required for Adaptimmune to comply with its legally required reporting obligations. MD Anderson consents to such disclosure, to the extent such disclosure is required for Adaptimmune to comply with Applicable Laws. MD Anderson shall ensure that the Principal Investigator provides in a timely manner all such reasonable information to Adaptimmune necessary for Adaptimmune to comply with any disclosure requirements to the extent required by and in accordance with 21 C.F.R. Part 54, including but not limited to, any information required to be disclosed in connection with any financial relationship between Adaptimmune and the Principal Investigators and sub-investigators involved in the Study, as well as any immediate family members thereof. MD Anderson will ensure that Principal Investigator promptly updates any provided information if any relevant changes occur during the performance of any Study and for one year following completion of any Study.",

        "explanation": "Moving the acknowledgement of Adaptimmune's disclosure obligations under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to the end of the paragraph, and after a sentence about investigator updates, obscures its importance. It implies it is related only to Principal Investigator's responsibilities rather than Adaptimmune's, potentially making it more difficult to enforce Adaptimmune's compliance with these obligations.",

        "law_explanation": "The Physician Payments Sunshine Act mandates that manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. By obscuring Adaptimmune's acknowledgement of this obligation within a paragraph primarily discussing funding commitments and investigator responsibilities, the contract creates ambiguity about the extent and nature of Adaptimmune's reporting responsibilities, potentially hindering enforcement of the Sunshine Act's transparency requirements.",

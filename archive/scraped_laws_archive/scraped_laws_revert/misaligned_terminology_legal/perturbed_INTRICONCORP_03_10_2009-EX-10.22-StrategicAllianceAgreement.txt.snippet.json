        "changed_text": "An Assisted Listening Device (\"ALD\") is defined as a device primarily used for entertainment purposes. Hearing Aids are amplification devices primarily designed to compensate for hearing loss, designed for listening only (through a microphone, telecoil, Direct Audio Input or other similar audio pathways and run on a low power hybrid circuit.",
        "explanation": "The original definition of \"Assisted Listening Device\" (ALD) aligns with its common understanding in healthcare. By defining it as a device primarily for \"entertainment purposes,\" the modified text contradicts its actual use and regulatory classification under FDA guidelines, which consider ALDs as medical devices if intended to mitigate hearing impairment.",

        "law_explanation": "The FD&C Act defines medical devices based on their intended use. Defining ALDs as primarily for entertainment contradicts the FDA's view of these devices when they are intended to compensate for hearing loss, potentially misclassifying them and affecting regulatory oversight.",

        "explanation": "The original definition of Confidential Information is broad, covering various forms of business-related data. The modified definition narrows it to only trade secrets physically marked as confidential and excludes information shared before the agreement's start. This conflicts with standard legal interpretations that protect a wider range of confidential business information, including unpatented but sensitive data.",

        "law_explanation": "UTSA protects trade secrets, which are defined as information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable.

        "explanation": "The original definition of 'Business Day' aligns with the standard understanding of excluding weekends and public holidays. The modified definition includes weekends and public holidays if the party deems it suitable, which contradicts the standard legal and commercial definition. This creates uncertainty regarding deadlines and obligations tied to business days.",

        "law_explanation": "While the Corporations Act doesn't explicitly define 'Business Day', it implies a conventional definition through its provisions regarding timeframes for corporate actions and reporting, which typically exclude weekends and public holidays. The changed definition would lead to conflict when calculating statutory deadlines in Australia.",

        "original_text": "Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member's relationship with Franchisee.",
        "changed_text": "Member should endeavor not to, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for purposes outside what they believe to be the operation of the Franchised Business, confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member's relationship with Franchisee.",
        "explanation": "Replacing 'shall not' with 'should endeavor not to' weakens the obligation. Introducing 'what they believe to be' allows for subjective interpretation of what constitutes 'the operation of the Franchised Business', potentially leading to the misuse of confidential information.",

        "law_explanation": "The UTSA defines misappropriation of trade secrets as including unauthorized disclosure or use. By allowing the member to subjectively determine what constitutes 'the operation of the Franchised Business', the modified text contradicts the UTSA's prohibition of unauthorized use or disclosure, making it difficult to enforce the confidentiality of trade secrets. The UTSA requires reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy which goes against the 'endeavor' statement, which is less effortful.",

        "explanation": "By replacing 'covenants and agrees that ... shall not' with 'generally agrees that ... will consider avoiding', the obligation is weakened to a suggestion. The addition of 'unless unusual circumstances arise' introduces a broad exception. The addition of 'might be seen to' and 'perceived as similar' makes the definition of 'Competitive Business' subjective.",

        "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits non-compete agreements. While there are exceptions, the modified text's ambiguity and weakening of the restriction create a scenario where the non-compete clause could be challenged and deemed unenforceable under California law, as it is not narrowly tailored and relies on subjective interpretations.",

        "original_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",

        "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the legal obligation. The original text clearly states that any failure to comply will cause irreparable injury and the member will pay legal fees. The changed text uses subjective terms like 'perceived failure,' 'generally adhere to the spirit,' 'might arguably cause,' and 'some form of injury.' It also changes the mandatory obligation to pay costs to a conditional 'will consider contributing' based on a mediator's opinion.",

        "law_explanation": "Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) generally allows for costs to be awarded to the prevailing party in a lawsuit. By making the payment of court costs and attorney's fees dependent on a mediator's determination of fairness and the member's willingness to 'consider contributing,' the modified text undermines the predictability and potential enforcement of cost recovery, potentially contradicting the spirit and application of FRCP 54(d) which provides a baseline expectation of cost allocation to the prevailing party, absent specific statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary. The term 'fair' is ambiguous.",

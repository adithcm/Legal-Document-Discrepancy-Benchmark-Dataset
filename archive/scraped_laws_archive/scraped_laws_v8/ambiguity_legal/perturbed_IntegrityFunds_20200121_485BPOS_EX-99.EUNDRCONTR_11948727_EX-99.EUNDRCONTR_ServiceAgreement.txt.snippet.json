        "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless' with 'will consider indemnifying' makes the indemnification discretionary rather than mandatory. Adding the condition that indemnification 'will only apply to claims directly resulting from information provided solely by the Fund' narrows the scope significantly and introduces ambiguity regarding what constitutes 'directly resulting' and how contribution is determined, weakening investor protection.

The original text provides a clear indemnification agreement from the Fund to Integrity, consistent with the allocation of responsibility for accurate disclosures. However, the modified text's discretionary indemnification ('will consider') and narrowed scope undermine this protection. The 'directly resulting' clause introduces a subjective element, making it more difficult for Integrity to seek indemnification, especially if its actions are deemed to have 'contributed' to the misstatement. This ambiguity can discourage Integrity from thoroughly scrutinizing the Fund's disclosures, potentially increasing the risk of inaccurate statements and weakening investor safeguards, which are central to the purpose of Section 11.",

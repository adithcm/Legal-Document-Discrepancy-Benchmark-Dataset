The original text establishes a clear obligation for the Seller to defend and indemnify, while the modified text makes it discretionary, dependent on the Seller's willingness. Adding \"potential threat\" adds another layer of vagueness to what exactly seller is willing to indemnify against. This introduces vagueness on the liability of seller.",

Recent laws may not yet be included in the ILCS database, but they are found on this site as Public Acts soon after they become law. For information concerning the relationship between statutes and Public Acts, refer to the Guide . Because the statute database is maintained primarily for legislative drafting purposes, statutory changes are sometimes included in the statute database before they take effect. If the source note at the end of a Section of the statutes includes a Public Act that has not yet taken effect, the version of the law that is currently in effect may have already been removed from the database and you should refer to that Public Act to see the changes made to the current law.

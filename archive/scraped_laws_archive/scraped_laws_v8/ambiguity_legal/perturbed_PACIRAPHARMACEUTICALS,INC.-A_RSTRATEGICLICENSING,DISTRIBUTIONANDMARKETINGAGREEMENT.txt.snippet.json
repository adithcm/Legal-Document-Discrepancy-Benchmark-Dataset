        "original_text": "EKR shall, as determined in its sole discretion to be commercially reasonable, prepare studies of the markets and sales potential of the Products for countries in the Territory other than the United States and present such studies to the Committee. EKR shall at its own cost and expense use commercially reasonable efforts to take those steps reasonably necessary in order to obtain and thereafter maintain Marketing Authorizations (including pricing and reimbursement approvals) for the Product in those countries of the Territory other than the United States which the Committee determines to present commercially viable opportunities for the Product.",
        "changed_text": "EKR shall, as it sees fit, prepare some studies of the markets and sales potential of the Products for countries in the Territory other than the United States and present such studies to the Committee. EKR shall at its own cost and expense endeavor to take steps to obtain and maintain Marketing Authorizations (including pricing and reimbursement approvals) for the Product in those countries of the Territory other than the United States which the Committee considers potentially viable.",
        "explanation": "The original text requires EKR to use 'commercially reasonable efforts'. The changed text weakens this obligation by using vague terms such as 'as it sees fit' and 'endeavor to take steps' which are open to subjective interpretation. This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the obligation to obtain and maintain Marketing Authorizations.",

By weakening the obligation to obtain and maintain marketing authorization, the change increases the risk of non-compliance with FDA regulations about reporting. Specifically, if marketing authorization isn't maintained (due to the ambiguous language), subsequent reporting requirements become unclear and potentially ignored, contravening the explicit requirements of 21 CFR § 314.81(b)(3)(i).",

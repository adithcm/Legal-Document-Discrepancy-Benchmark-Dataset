Each Party agrees to refrain from, either during period of this Agreement or at any other time thereafter, disclosing, using or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement.",
        "changed_text": "Each Party will endeavor to hold in confidence confidential information acquired during this relationship. Each Party will try to refrain from disclosing confidential information, acquired during this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The terms 'agrees to hold in confidence' and 'agrees to refrain from' are replaced with 'will endeavor to hold in confidence' and 'will try to refrain from', weakening the obligation to maintain confidentiality. This introduces ambiguity as 'endeavor' and 'try' suggest effort rather than a strict requirement, potentially allowing parties to disclose confidential information if they deem it necessary.",

        "law_explanation": "PUTSA, as adopted in Pennsylvania, provides legal remedies for the misappropriation of trade secrets. By weakening the confidentiality obligation, the modified text makes it more difficult to prove misappropriation, as the duty to protect confidential information is no longer strictly defined, potentially conflicting with the statute's intent to protect trade secrets.",

        "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should when feasible' and 'shall have no duty' to 'will generally not be expected' introduces ambiguity. 'Should when feasible' makes prepayment discretionary and subject to interpretation, while 'generally not be expected' does not entirely remove Marv's obligation to pay.

        "law_explanation": "Pennsylvania contract law requires clear and definite terms for an agreement to be enforceable. The introduction of ambiguity regarding prepayment of IP costs could render this section of the contract unenforceable, because the terms are not clear, creating uncertainty and hindering the enforcement of the contractual obligation to reimburse Marv for IP costs. This uncertainty undermines the foundational principles of contract law in Pennsylvania.",

Optional elements 2 and 3 both involve conditions precedent. A “condition precedent” is either an act of a party that must be performed or an uncertain event that must happen before the contractual right accrues or the contractual duty arises. ( Stephens & Stephens XII, LLC v . Fireman’ s Fund Ins. Co. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 91 1 131, 1 147 [180 Cal.Rptr .3d 683].) Element 2 involves the first kind of condition precedent; an act that must be performed by one party before the other is required to perform. Include the second option if the plaintif f alleges that the plaintif f was excused from having to perform some or all of the contractual conditions. Not every breach of contract by the plaintif f will relieve the defendant of the obligation to perform. The breach must be material; element 2 captures materiality by requiring that the plaintif f have done the significant things that the contract required. Also, the two obligations must be dependent , meaning that the parties specifically bargained that the failure to perform the one relieves the obligation to perform the other . While materiality is generally a question of fact, whether covenants are dependent or independent is a matter of construing the agreement. ( Br own v . Grimes (201 1) 192 Cal.App.4th 265, 277-279 [120 Cal.Rptr .3d 893].) If there is no extrinsic evidence in aid of construction, the question is one of law for the court. ( V er dier v . V erdier (1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 325, 333 [284 P .2d 94].) Therefore, element 2 should not be given unless the court has determined that dependent obligations are involved. If parol evidence is required and a dispute of facts is presented, additional instructions on the disputed facts will be necessary . (See City of Hope National Medical Center v . Genentech, Inc. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 375, 395 [75 Cal.Rptr .3d 333, 181 P .3d 142].) Element 3 involves the second kind of condition precedent; an uncertain event that must happen before contractual duties are triggered. Include the second option if the plaintif f alleges that the defendant agreed to perform even though a condition did not occur . For reasons that the occurrence of a condition may have been excused, see the Restatement Second of Contracts, sect",

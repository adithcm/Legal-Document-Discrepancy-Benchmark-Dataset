        "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be generally guided by principles similar to the laws of Japan, but specific interpretations shall be at the discretion of the parties involved.",
        "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the contract is governed and construed under Japanese law. The modified text introduces ambiguity by suggesting a loose adherence to 'principles similar to' Japanese law and granting 'discretion' to the parties. This undermines the enforceability and predictability that comes with a clearly defined governing law.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 3 of the Act on General Rules for Application of Laws specifies the rules for determining the applicable law. By stating the agreement is 'generally guided by principles similar to' the laws of Japan' and adding 'but specific interpretations shall be at the discretion of the parties involved,' it potentially contradicts this Article by creating uncertainty as to whether Japanese law truly applies and by allowing parties to deviate from established legal interpretations, weakening the certainty provided by conflict of laws rules.",

        "original_text": "the Nissin Parties agree to cause each of VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement with respect to the indemnification or reimbursement, as applicable, of all Directors and Officers (except those individuals resigning pursuant to Section 6.2.6 of the VNBJ SPA and Section 6.2.6 of the VNBZ SPA) with respect to any Liabilities arising prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
        "changed_text": "the Nissin Parties will endeavor to facilitate compliance by VNBJ and VNBZ with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement regarding potential indemnification or reimbursement, as applicable, of Directors and Officers (except those individuals resigning pursuant to Section 6.2.6 of the VNBJ SPA and Section 6.2.6 of the VNBZ SPA) relating to asserted Liabilities prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'agree to cause' to 'will endeavor to facilitate' weakens the obligation of the Nissin Parties, making it less certain that the indemnification or reimbursement will actually occur. Replacing 'with respect to any Liabilities' with 'relating to asserted Liabilities' introduces ambiguity by requiring a determination of what constitutes an 'asserted' liability, which could be open to interpretation and delay the process.",

        ],
        "law_explanation": "Article 430 of the Companies Act addresses the liability of directors and officers. By changing the language to make indemnification and reimbursement less certain, there is a potential contradiction as it could undermine the legal protections for directors and officers established by the Act, particularly if the 'endeavor to facilitate' is not carried out effectively and asserted liabilities are not properly addressed. This creates ambiguity about how liabilities are handled.",

        "changed_text": "Article 4.Effectiveness This Amendment shall become effective upon what the parties consider a substantial completion of the VNBJ Closing with respect to Article 1.1 and the VNBZ Closing with respect to Article 1.2, and may terminate if the VNBJ SPA and the VNBZ SPA are terminated based on reasonable considerations.",
        "explanation": "The original text specifies clear conditions for the amendment's effectiveness and termination: the VNBJ and VNBZ Closings. The modified text introduces vagueness by replacing these clear conditions with 'substantial completion' and 'reasonable considerations'. 'Substantial completion' is open to interpretation, and 'reasonable considerations' provides no objective standard for termination, allowing parties to potentially avoid their obligations.",

        ],
        "law_explanation": "Article 91 of the Civil Code of Japan states that if the parties to a juristic act have declared a different intention from any provisions of laws and regulations which are not related to public policy, such intention shall prevail. By modifying the effectiveness and termination conditions from definitive events (closings) to subjective concepts ('substantial completion,' 'reasonable considerations'), the alteration introduces ambiguity in whether intent has been clearly formed/expressed, and undermines the enforceability of contract by creating uncertainty that contradicts the legal certainty sought under Article 91. The contract, therefore, potentially weakens the clarity required for juristic acts under Japanese law.",

The modified text weakens this, potentially leading to insufficient promotion, which could be viewed as a deceptive practice if the product's success relies heavily on the company's marketing efforts as presented during the contract negotiation. This contradicts 815 ILCS 505/2 because the ambiguity allows the company to not actively promote the product and the act forbids that they use deception in the distribution of the product.",

As a result, consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit service businesses which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers. Certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit services have worked a financial hardship upon the people of this State, often on those who are of limited economic means and inexperienced in credit matters. (b) The purpose of this Act is to provide prospective consumers of credit services companies with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of those services and to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices.

CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image in connection with the marketing, advertising, promotion and sale of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. However, Adams Golf may only use Consultant's likeness for internal marketing material.",
        "explanation": "The original text grants rights to use the consultant's likeness for marketing, advertising, promotion, and sale of products. The modified text restricts likeness usage to internal marketing materials only. This creates a contradiction because 'endorsement' typically includes public-facing advertising and promotion.",

        "law_explanation": "The Lanham Act protects trademark holders' rights to use their marks (including likeness as part of endorsement) in commerce to advertise and sell goods. By restricting the use of likeness to internal marketing, the modified text weakens the endorsement's commercial value, potentially infringing on Adams Golf's reasonable expectation of benefit, creating ambiguity and enforceability issues under trademark law.",

A fiduciary relationship creates a duty of good faith between the agent and the principal . The breach of this duty of good faith can lead to liability . Failure to act in good faith is known as bad faith and is generally considered to be a level of culpability greater than negligence .

By replacing 'any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law' with 'any foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local traffic law', the modified text significantly narrows the grounds for termination.

Under contract law, an excuse can be used by a buyer for non-performance of contractual duties when a later and unforeseen event impedes the buyer's purpose for entering into the contract, and the seller at the time of entering the contract knew of the buyer's purpose. For example, if the parties enter into a futures contract for grain, but a fire causes the seller to have no crop that year and is unable to perform the contract, the buyer can use the frustration of purpose to excuse performance.

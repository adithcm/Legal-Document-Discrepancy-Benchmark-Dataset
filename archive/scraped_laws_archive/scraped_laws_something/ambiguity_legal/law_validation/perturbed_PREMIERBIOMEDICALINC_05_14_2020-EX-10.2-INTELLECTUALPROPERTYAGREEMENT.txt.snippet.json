        "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarterly period ending on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, or December 31st, commencing with the one-year anniversary of the effective date of this Agreement, THI shall furnish to Marv a statement certified by a responsible official of the Licensee showing in a manner acceptable to Marv: i. all Licensed Products which were sold, leased or put into use during such quarterly period by THI or any of its Related Companies, the gross sales received for the Licensed Products, and the Fair Market Values of such Licensed Products; ii. all services performed by THI or any of its Related Companies that directly or indirectly used Licensed Product, the gross sales received by the services, and the Fair Market Value of such services; 2 iii. the amount of royalty payable thereon, and iv. if no Licensed Product has been so sold, leased or put into use or if no services have been performed, the statement shall show that fact.",
        "changed_text": "Within approximately thirty (30) days after the end of each quarterly period, THI should endeavor to furnish to Marv a statement certified by an official of the Licensee showing information that Marv finds generally agreeable regarding: i. Licensed Products sold; ii. services performed that used the Licensed Product; 2 iii. royalties payable thereon; and iv. if no Licensed Product has been sold or services performed, a statement reflecting such.",
        "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity through the use of 'approximately,' 'should endeavor,' 'official,' 'generally agreeable,' and generally weakens the clarity and precision of the original reporting requirements. These vague terms make it difficult to enforce specific reporting standards.",

        "law_explanation": "The Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, Section 1304, implies a duty of good faith in the performance and enforcement of contracts. By making the reporting requirements vague and subjective ('approximately,' 'should endeavor,' 'generally agreeable'), the modified text allows THI to potentially provide incomplete or misleading reports, arguably violating the implied duty of good faith under Pennsylvania law.",

        "justification": "The LLM attempts to connect the introduction of ambiguity in reporting requirements to a breach of good faith under Pennsylvania's UCC. However, the scraped law snippet is a 'Page Not Found' error, indicating either the law is not accurately cited, unavailable, or non-existent at the provided URL. Thus, I cannot verify that the cited law exists or supports the claim. Furthermore, the connection between 'approximately' and bad faith is tenuous without further context. Therefore, confidence is very low."

Reimbursement for pre-paid IP Costs shall be in accordance with 2 (b) 2 above.",

        "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity and weakens the obligation to reimburse IP costs. Replacing 'shall reimburse' with 'will consider reimbursing' makes the reimbursement discretionary. The addition of 'subject to available funds and management discretion' and 'at THI\u2019s convenience' further undermines the certainty of payment. This opens it to dispute whether THI is actually required to reimburse Marv, even for necessary costs to preserve IP.",

        "law_explanation": "Under Pennsylvania law, a breach of contract occurs when a party fails to perform a duty imposed by the contract. By making the reimbursement of IP costs discretionary rather than mandatory, the modified text creates a situation where THI could avoid paying legitimate IP costs, potentially breaching the contract. The original text establishes a clear obligation; the modified text removes that clarity, making enforcement uncertain.",

        "justification": "While the LLM's explanation of breach of contract under Pennsylvania law is generally correct, the lack of a specific legal citation in the 'Scraped Law Snippet' makes it difficult to definitively verify the relevance of a particular law to this specific contractual modification. The general principle of breach of contract supports the idea that making a previously mandatory obligation discretionary could lead to a breach if the obligation isn't met, but without a specific statute or case law, the confidence is moderate."

        "original_text": "Overdue payments hereunder shall be subject to a late payment charge calculated at an annual rate of three percent (3%) over the prime rate or successive prime rates (as posted in New York City) during delinquency. If the amount of such charge exceeds the maximum permitted by law, such charge shall be reduced to such maximum.",
        "changed_text": "Overdue payments hereunder may be subject to a late payment charge, possibly calculated based on standard industry practices, and subject to applicable legal limits.",
        "explanation": "This modification replaces a specific, clearly defined late payment charge calculation with vague terms. Replacing 'shall be subject to' with 'may be subject to' makes the imposition of a late payment charge discretionary. The term 'possibly calculated based on standard industry practices' is ambiguous and lacks a clear reference point. Removing the reference to the prime rate makes it impossible to determine the actual late payment charge. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the consequences of late payments.",

        "law_explanation": "Pennsylvania's usury law sets limits on the interest rates that can be charged on loans and debts. While the original clause acknowledged these limits by stating that the charge would be reduced to the maximum permitted by law, the modified clause's ambiguity makes it difficult to determine whether any late payment charge complies with usury laws. The lack of a defined calculation method introduces the possibility that a charge could be imposed that exceeds legal limits, particularly since 'standard industry practices' are not inherently compliant with Pennsylvania law. By removing a specific value, it becomes ambiguous whether the late fee is an illegal usurious charge.",

        "justification": "The modification introduces ambiguity regarding late payment charges, potentially conflicting with Pennsylvania's usury laws. The scraped law snippet confirms the existence of interest rate limits. The connection is plausible, as ambiguous terms could lead to charges exceeding legal limits. However, the snippet doesn't explicitly address late payment charges, making the link slightly indirect and lowering the confidence score."

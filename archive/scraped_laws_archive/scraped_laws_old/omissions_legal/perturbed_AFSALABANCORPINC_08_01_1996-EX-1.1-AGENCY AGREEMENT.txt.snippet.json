        "original_text": "The Association is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (\"FHLBNY\"); and the deposit accounts of the Association are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits. Upon consummation of the Conversion, the liquidation account for the benefit of Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders will be duly established in accordance with the requirements of the Conversion Regulations.",

Upon consummation of the Conversion, the liquidation account for the benefit of Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders will be duly established in accordance with the requirements of the Conversion Regulations.",
        "explanation": "Removing the clause 'the deposit accounts of the Association are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits' omits a crucial consumer protection detail required by federal law for savings and loan associations. This creates a legal contradiction by failing to disclose deposit insurance.",

        "changed_text": "The Company shall register its Common Stock under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act concurrent with the stock offering pursuant to the Plan and shall request that such registration be effective upon completion of the Conversion.",
        "explanation": "Removing the clause 'The Company shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration for not less than three years or such shorter period as permitted by the OTS' eliminates a guarantee to maintain registration and provide transparency, which contradicts consumer protection principles embedded in securities laws.",

        "explanation": "By removing 'certified by independent public accountants and prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act' this weakens the requirement to provide independently audited financial reports to stockholders as mandated by securities regulations.",

(c) An action to foreclose a mortgage. (d) An action alleging a willful violation of s. 448.110 . (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), an action for breach of a property insurance contract, with the period running from the date of loss. (3) WITHIN FOUR YEARS. — (a) An action relating to the determination of paternity, with the time running from the date the child reaches the age of majority. (b) An action founded on the design, planning, or construction of an improvement to real property, with the time running from the date the authority having jurisdiction issues a temporary certificate of occupancy, a certificate of occupancy, or a certificate of completion, or the date of abandonment of construction if not completed, whichever date is earliest; except that, when the action involves a latent defect, the time runs from the time the defect is discovered or should have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence. In any event, the action must be commenced within 7 years after the date the authority having jurisdiction issues a temporary certificate of occupancy, a certificate of occupancy, or a certificate of completion, or the date of abandonment of construction if not completed, whichever date is earliest. However, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims that arise out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out or attempted to be set out in a pleading may be commenced up to 1 year after the pleading to which such claims relate is served, even if such claims would otherwise be time barred. With respect to actions founded on the design, planning, or construction of an improvement to real property, if such construction is performed pursuant to a duly issued building permit and if the authority having jurisdiction has issued a temporary certificate of occupancy, a certificate of occupancy, or a certificate of completion, then as to the construction which is within the scope of such building permit and certificate, the correction of defects to completed work or repair of completed work, whether performed under warranty or otherwise, does not extend the period of time within which an action must be commenced. If a newly constructed single-dwelling residential building is used as a model home, the time begins to run from the date that a deed is recorded first transferring title to another party. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if the improvement to real property consists of the design, planning, or construction of multiple buildings, each building must be considered its own improvement for purposes of determining the limitations period set forth in this paragraph.

(o) Any action not specifically provided for in these statutes. (p) An action alleging a violation, other than a willful violation, of s. 448.110 .

(b) An action for professional malpractice, other than medical malpractice, whether founded on contract or tort; provided that the period of limitations shall run from the time the cause of action is discovered or should have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence.

(c) An action for medical malpractice shall be commenced within 2 years from the time the incident giving rise to the action occurred or within 2 years from the time the incident is discovered, or should have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence; however, in no event shall the action be commenced later than 4 years from the date of the incident or occurrence out of which the cause of action accrued, except that this 4-year period shall not bar an action brought on behalf of a minor on or before the child’s eighth birthday. An “action for medical malpractice” is defined as a claim in tort or in contract for damages because of the death, injury, or monetary loss to any person arising out of any medical, dental, or surgical diagnosis, treatment, or care by any provider of health care. The limitation of actions within this subsection shall be limited to the health care provider and persons in privity with the provider of health care. In those actions covered by this paragraph in which it can be shown that fraud, concealment, or intentional misrepresentation of fact prevented the discovery of the injury the period of limitations is extended forward 2 years from the time that the injury is discovered or should have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence, but in no event to exceed 7 years from the date the incident giving rise to the injury occurred, except that this 7-year period shall not bar an action brought on behalf of a minor on or before the child’s eighth birthday. This paragraph shall not apply to actions for which ss. 766.301 - 766.316 provide the exclusive remedy. (d) An action to recover wages or overtime or damages or penalties concerning payment of wages and overtime. (e) An action for wrongful death.

        "original_text": "Shipment of the Source Plasma to Sanofi Pasteur shall be made in compliance with the transportation conditions as provided in the Quality Agreement (as defined below), to be further amended by the Parties as contemplated in Section 9 below.",
        "changed_text": "Shipment of the Source Plasma to Sanofi Pasteur shall be made according to ADMA's standard operating procedures.",
        "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with transportation conditions specified in a Quality Agreement that is consistent with federal regulations. The modified version replaces this explicit requirement with vague reference to ADMA's 'standard operating procedures', which may not adhere to the stringent standards outlined in the 21 CFR Part 600 and related guidelines for biological product shipment.",

        "law_url": "https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-600",
        "law_explanation": "This change contradicts the regulation because it fails to ensure that the shipment of Source Plasma complies with the stringent conditions and standards required for biological products. It does not mandate that the source plasma must follow strict rules, which causes a failure to comply with legal and regulatory standards.",

        "changed_text": "The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete such amendment to the Quality Agreement within 180 days after the Amendment Effective Date.",
        "explanation": "This is a change from 60 days to 180 days. While not a direct contradiction, the new language \"180 days\" introduces uncertainty and potential non-compliance issues depending on what is in the amendment to the quality agreement.

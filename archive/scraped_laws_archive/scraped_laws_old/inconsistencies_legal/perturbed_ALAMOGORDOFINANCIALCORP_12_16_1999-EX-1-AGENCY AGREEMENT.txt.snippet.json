(b) Spinning (1) No member or person associated with a member may allocate shares of a new issue to any account in which an executive officer or director of a public company or a covered non-public company, or a person materially supported by such executive officer or director, has a beneficial interest: (A) if the company is currently an investment banking services client of the member or the member has received compensation from the company for investment banking services in the past 12 months; (B) if the person responsible for making the allocation decision knows or has reason to know that the member intends to provide, or expects to be retained by the company for, investment banking services within the next 3 months; or (C) on the express or implied condition that such executive officer or director, on behalf of the company, will retain the member for the performance of future investment banking services. (2) The prohibitions in this paragraph shall not apply to allocations of shares of a new issue to any account described in Rule 5130 (c)(1) through (3) and (5) through (11), or to any other account in which the beneficial interests of executive officers and directors of the company and persons materially supported by such executive officers and directors in the aggregate do not exceed 25% of such account. (c) Policies Concerning Flipping (1) No member or person associated with a member may directly or indirectly recoup, or attempt to recoup, any portion of a commission or credit paid or awarded to an associated person for selling shares of a new issue that are subsequently flipped by a customer, unless the managing underwriter has assessed a penalty bid on the entire syndicate.

Any lock-up agreement or other restriction on the transfer of the issuer's shares by officers and directors of the issuer entered into in connection with a new issue shall provide that: (A) Any lock-up agreement or other restriction on the transfer of the issuer's shares by officers and directors of the issuer shall provide that such restrictions will apply to their issuer-directed shares; and (B) At least two business days before the release or waiver of any lock-up or other restriction on the transfer of the issuer's shares, the book-running lead manager will notify the issuer of the impending release or waiver and announce the impending release or waiver through a major news service, except where the release or waiver is effected solely to permit a transfer of securities that is not for consideration or that is to an immediate family member as defined in Rule 5130(i)(5) and where the transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the same lock-up agreement terms in place for the transferor; (3) Agreement Among Underwriters. The agreement between the book-running lead manager and other syndicate members must require, to the extent not inconsistent with SEC Regulation M, that any shares trading at a premium to the public offering price that are returned by a purchaser to a syndicate member after secondary market trading commences: (A) be used to offset the existing syndicate short position, or (B) if no syndicate short position exists, the member must either: (i) offer returned shares at the public offering price to unfilled customers' orders pursuant to a random allocation methodology, or (ii) sell returned shares on the secondary market and donate profits from the sale to an unaffiliated charitable organization with the condition that the donation be treated as an anonymous donation to avoid any reputational benefit to the member.

Such circumstances include the relative degree of the issuer's ownership of the domestic or foreign firm and the laws and practices governing the business operations of the country in which such firm is located.

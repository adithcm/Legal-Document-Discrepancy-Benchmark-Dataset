Once every twelve (12) months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with i-Escrow's business activities and with no less than fifteen (15) days notice. i-Escrow shall within two (2) weeks make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit. Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of ten percent (10%) of the payments owed to date, i-Escrow shall immediately pay all cost of such audit.",

        "scraped_snippet": "conflict of laws | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you conflict of laws Conflict of laws refers to a difference between the laws of two or more jurisdictions with some connection to a case, such that the outcome depends on which jurisdiction's law will be used to resolve each issue in dispute . The conflicting legal rules may come from U.S. federal law, the laws of U.S. states, or the laws of other countries. The process by which a court determines what law to apply is sometimes referred to as \"characterization\" or \"classification.\" This determination must be made in accordance with the law of the forum . A federal court in a case before it based on diversity of citizenship , for example, determines the conflict of law issue as if it were the highest court in the state in which it is sitting. Courts faced with a choice of law issue generally have two choices: A court can apply the law of the forum ( lex fori ) -- which is usually the result when the question of what law to apply is procedural . Or the court can apply the law of the site of the transaction or occurrence that gave rise to the litigation in the first place ( lex loci ) -- this is usually the controlling law selected when the matter is substantive . Federal courts play by different rules than state courts because federal jurisdiction is limited to what has been enumerated in the Constitution . The rules that federal courts must obey regarding which laws to apply are extremely complex.

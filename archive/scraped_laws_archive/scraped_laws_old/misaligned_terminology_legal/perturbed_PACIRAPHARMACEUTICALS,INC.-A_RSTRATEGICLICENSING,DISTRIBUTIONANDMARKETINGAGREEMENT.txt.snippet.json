        "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" With respect to any Party to this Agreement shall mean any vaguely related company, corporation, firm, individual or other entity with some association to such Party to this Agreement for only so long as such association exists;",
        "explanation": "The original definition uses 'Controls, is Controlled by or is under common Control' which has a specific legal and financial meaning. Changing the definition to 'any vaguely related company...with some association' introduces ambiguity. This undermines the purpose of defining affiliates, which is to clearly delineate entities with specific influence or ownership ties.",

        "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.405",
        "law_explanation": "The modified definition introduces uncertainty by replacing the clear criterion of 'control' with vague terms like 'vaguely related' and 'some association.' This directly contradicts the definition of affiliate under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR § 230.405), which requires 'control' (the power to direct management and policies) to establish affiliation. The change could allow parties to exploit loopholes by claiming or denying affiliate status based on subjective interpretations, affecting compliance with securities laws.",

        "law_explanation": "The modified definition directly contradicts the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.) by treating legally mandated regulations as optional guidelines. The FD&C Act imposes strict requirements on the manufacturing, labeling, and distribution of drugs and devices. By redefining 'Applicable Laws' to encompass only suggestions, the contract fails to ensure compliance with these mandatory legal standards, rendering the agreement unenforceable and potentially exposing parties to legal penalties for non-compliance with the FD&C Act.",

        "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" Means what each Party considers it to be, as long as they mark the document with the word 'confidential' regardless of its nature or availability to the public, with no exclusions, creating an unlimited interpretation of what qualifies as such.",

The change removes the requirement that the information has independent economic value and allows parties to designate publicly available information as 'confidential' simply by marking it as such. This contradicts the UTSA's requirement for genuine secrecy and economic value, potentially leading to the wrongful assertion of trade secret claims over non-confidential information.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Business Day' is altered to give the Company discretion over which days are considered business days. This contradicts standard legal and financial definitions of 'Business Day,' which are typically tied to objective criteria like banking holidays.",

        "explanation": "This removes the restriction on the Company's ability to issue similar debt securities during the remarketing period. This contradicts the implied agreement to protect the value of the remarketed securities by limiting the supply of similar securities, which could be seen as a breach of good faith and fair dealing.",

        "law_explanation": "UCC § 1-304 states that every contract or duty within the Uniform Commercial Code imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.

        "explanation": "The governing law of the contract is changed from New York to Delaware, where the Company is incorporated.

The choice of law is respected unless the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties choice, or application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state. Given the significant contacts with New York, switching to Delaware law may be contested and found unenforceable if New York has a materially greater interest.",

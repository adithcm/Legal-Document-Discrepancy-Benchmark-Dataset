        "changed_text": "Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way be construed to constitute Consultant as an agent, employee or representative of Company, but Consultant shall perform the Services as a worker.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' creates ambiguity. While the intent might be the same, some state labor laws define 'worker' broadly, potentially including individuals who might otherwise be misclassified as independent contractors. This could lead to challenges in determining the consultant's actual status and the company's obligations.",

        "law_explanation": "The IRS provides guidelines for determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Using the vague term 'worker' obscures the clear distinction that the company claims to establish, making it easier for a court or agency to reclassify the consultant as an employee based on the actual working relationship.",

Form W-4P, Withholding Certificate for Periodic Pension or Annuity Payments (previously titled Withholding Certificate for Pension or Annuity Payments), was redesigned for 2022. Form W-4P is now used only to make withholding elections for periodic pension or annuity payments. Previously, Form W-4P was also used to make withholding elections for nonperiodic payments and eligible rollover distributions. Withholding elections for nonperiodic payments and eligible rollover distributions are now made on Form W-4R, Withholding Certificate for Nonperiodic Payments and Eligible Rollover Distributions. See section 8 for more information about withholding on retirement payments and annuities. See Pub. 15-T to figure withholding on periodic pension and annuity payments. 2025 withholding tables.

Section 11048 of P.L. 115-97, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, suspends the exclusion for qualified moving expense reimbursements from your employee’s income for tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2026. However, the exclusion is still available in the case of a member of the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty who moves because of a permanent change of station due to a military order. The exclusion applies only to reimbursement of moving expenses that the member could deduct if they had paid or incurred them without reimbursement. See Moving Expenses in Pub. 3, Armed Forces’ Tax Guide, for the definition of what constitutes a permanent change of station and to learn which moving expenses are deductible.

        "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, with selective application of its conflict of law principles.",
        "explanation": "Modifying the clause to allow 'selective application' of conflict of law principles introduces significant uncertainty. Normally, choice-of-law clauses are interpreted with a consistent approach to conflict of laws. Saying the application is selective gives one party an advantage and makes the contract hard to interpret, and therefore, weakens its enforceability.",

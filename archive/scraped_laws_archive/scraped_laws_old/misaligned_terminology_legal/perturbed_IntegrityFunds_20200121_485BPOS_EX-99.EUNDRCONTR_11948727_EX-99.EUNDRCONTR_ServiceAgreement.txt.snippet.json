        "original_text": "Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others.",
        "changed_text": "Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an independent contractor but will have the authority to act for and represent the Fund in specific instances detailed in Appendix A. Integrity will act as an agent for the Fund, and on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others.",
        "explanation": "This change contradicts the standard definition of an 'independent contractor.' By granting Integrity the authority to act for and represent the Fund, the agreement blurs the line between independent contractor and agent, creating a conflict. Independent contractors are typically defined by their autonomy, whereas agents act on behalf of a principal.",

        "law_explanation": "The IRS uses a common law test to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. A key factor is the level of control the business has over the worker. If the contract gives Integrity the authority to act for and represent the Fund, it suggests a level of control indicative of an agency relationship, not an independent contractor. This is because agents are expected to act on behalf of the business and the law states that 'an agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of another (the principal)'.",

        "changed_text": "Section 8.3 This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective of conflict of laws principles.",
        "explanation": "The Fund is organized as a Delaware statutory trust, as stated in the beginning of the document. Selecting Kansas law while the fund is organized as a Delaware statutory trust, without regard to conflicts of law principles, introduces uncertainty and potential legal challenges. Delaware law governs internal affairs of Delaware entities, including statutory trusts.",

        "law_explanation": "The Internal Affairs Doctrine generally dictates that the law of the state of incorporation (or formation, in the case of statutory trusts) governs the internal affairs of the entity. By selecting Kansas law without regard to conflict of laws, this provision may be unenforceable, as Delaware law would likely govern aspects of the fund's internal governance, potentially nullifying the selected state. The Delaware General Corporation Law, specifically Section 122, grants corporations (and by extension, statutory trusts) the power to make and alter bylaws, manage the business, etc., all governed by Delaware law.",

        "changed_text": "Section 7.1 This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods ending on January 18th of each year, provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the Fund's Board of Trustees or (b) a vote of a majority of the Fund's Trustees. Such approval may be obtained via email.",
        "explanation": "This modification contradicts the requirement under the Investment Company Act of 1940 for specific board approval processes involving disinterested trustees. By removing the 'Qualified Trustees' requirement and allowing email approval, the contract undermines the protections intended by the 1940 Act for fund shareholders.",

        "law_explanation": "Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that the board of directors, including a majority of disinterested directors, specifically approve the continuation of investment advisory and underwriting agreements. Allowing email approval and removing the disinterested trustee requirement circumvents the in-person voting requirements meant to ensure thorough and unbiased consideration of these agreements. The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires a vote cast in person and the law states that 'It shall be unlawful for any person to serve or act as investment adviser of a registered investment company, except pursuant to a written contract, which contract— (1) shall precisely describe all compensation to be paid thereunder; (2) shall continue in effect for a period more than two years from the date of its execution or renewal, only so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the board of directors or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such company'.",

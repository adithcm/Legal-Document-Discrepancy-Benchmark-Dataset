        "original_text": "Agent shall be permitted to utilize display, hanging signs, and interior banners in connection with the Sale; provided, however, that such display, hanging signs, and interior banners shall be professionally produced and hung in a professional manner. The Merchant and Agent shall not use neon or day-glo on its display, hanging signs, or interior banners. Furthermore, with respect to enclosed mall locations, no exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall shall be used unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Sale Guidelines. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize exterior banners at (i) non- enclosed mall Stores and (ii) enclosed mall Stores to the extent the entrance to the applicable Store does not require entry into the enclosed mall common area; provided, however, that such banners shall be located or hung so as to make clear that the Sale is being conducted only at the affected Store, shall not be wider than the storefront of the Store, and shall not be larger than 4 feet x 40 feet. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize sign walkers in a safe and professional manner and in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order.",
        "changed_text": "Agent may utilize display, hanging signs, and interior banners in connection with the Sale as reasonably practical. The Merchant and Agent should avoid using neon or day-glo on its display, hanging signs, or interior banners when feasible. Furthermore, with respect to enclosed mall locations, exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall may be used only when mutually agreed upon. In addition, the Merchant and Agent are encouraged to utilize exterior banners. In addition, the Merchant and Agent may consider utilizing sign walkers in a manner deemed appropriate.",
        "explanation": "This change weakens the requirements around advertising and signage, making them discretionary and vague. Replacing 'shall be permitted' with 'may utilize' and 'should avoid' reduces the legal obligation. Replacing \"shall be professionally produced and hung in a professional manner\" with \"as reasonably practical\" introduces ambiguity. Also \"exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall may be used only when mutually agreed upon\", makes it vague, and 'may consider utilizing sign walkers in a manner deemed appropriate' introduces discretion.",

        "law_explanation": "The modified text potentially contradicts ADA guidelines on accessibility and clear communication. For example, vague allowances for signage, 'as reasonably practical,' could lead to non-compliant signs that do not meet ADA's requirements for visibility and readability for individuals with disabilities, because those requirements are not mentioned or referenced.",

Tax Season is Here Learn About ADA-Related Tax Incentives for Businesses Table of contents ADA Standards for Accessible Design The ADA Standards for Accessible Design—along with the Title II and Title III regulations—say what is required for a building or facility to be physically accessible to people with disabilities. Law, Regulations, & Standards Read this document to understand your legal rights or responsibilities under the ADA. For a beginner-level introduction to a topic, view Topics For more detailed information on a topic, view Guidance & Resource materials The ADA Standards for Accessible Design (“ADA Standards”) cover: Newly constructed buildings and facilities; Alterations—such as, renovations and other changes that affect usability—made to buildings and facilities; Making architectural changes in existing state and local government buildings to provide “program access”; and Removing architectural barriers that are easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense in existing buildings of businesses. What are architectural barriers ? Architectural barriers are physical elements of a building that prevent movement or access for people with disabilities. For example, if the only way to get to the entrance of a business is by using stairs, those stairs are a barrier for wheelchair users. What does readily achievable mean? Readily achievable means easy to do without much difficulty or expense. This is based on the Title III business’s size and resources. So, a business with more resources is expected to remove more barriers than a business with fewer resources. The ADA strikes a careful balance between increasing access for people with disabilities and understanding the financial challenges of many small businesses. What does program access mean? State and local governments are required by Title II to provide program access . The program access requirement makes sure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from any program, service, or activity provided by the state or local government because existing buildings and facilities are inaccessible. State and local governments must look at their programs, services and activities in their entirety or as a whole to ensure that they are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Versions of the ADA Standards The Department of Justice adopted the first ADA Standards for Accessible Design (“ADA Standards”), on July 26, 1991, known as the “ 1991 ADA Standards ” and adopted revised ADA Standards on September 15, 2010, known as the “ 2010 ADA Standards ”, along with the Guidance on the 2010 Standards . The Guidance on the 2010 Standards addresses the changes to the ADA Standards, the reasoning behind those changes, and responses to public comments received on these topics. Knowing when the 1991 or the 2010 ADA Standards apply to buildings and facilities is important in determining if your building or facility complies with the ADA. The ADA Requirements: Effective Date and Compliance Date guide helps to explain which version of the ADA Standards to use and when.

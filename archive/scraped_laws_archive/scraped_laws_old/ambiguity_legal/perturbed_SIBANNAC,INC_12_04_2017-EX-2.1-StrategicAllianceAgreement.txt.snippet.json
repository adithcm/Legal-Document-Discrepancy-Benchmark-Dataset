By weakening the 'shall indemnify' obligation and removing detailed cost descriptions, the modified text creates ambiguity and could be interpreted as unenforceable under Texas law, particularly if COMPANY argues that its 'endeavor' was sufficient, even if full indemnification was not achieved. Also, by changing the definition of what is covered by the indemnity agreement, the contract could be interpreted to violate the anti-indemnity statute. Under the statute, a company generally cannot contract to indemnify a party if that party is negligent.",

(b) \"Financing agency\" means a bank, finance company or other person who in the ordinary course of business makes advances against goods or documents of title or who by arrangement with either the seller or the buyer intervenes in ordinary course to make or collect payment due or claimed under the contract for sale, as by purchasing or paying the seller's draft or making advances against it or by merely taking it for collection whether or not documents of title accompany or are associated with the draft. \"Financing agency\" includes also a bank or other person who similarly intervenes between persons who are in the position of seller and buyer in respect to the goods (Section 2.707 ). (c) \"Between merchants\" means in any transaction with respect to which both parties are chargeable with the knowledge or skill of merchants. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff.

(b) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are \"future\" goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell. (c) There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods. (d) An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common.

(a) In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires \"contract\" and \"agreement\" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \"Contract for sale\" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A \"sale\" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2.401 ). A \"present sale\" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract. (b) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are \"conforming\" or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract. (c) \"Termination\" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On \"termination\" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives. (d) \"Cancellation\" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of \"termination\" except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

(b) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in Subsection (a) or of timber to be cut is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties can by identification effect a present sale before severance. (c) The provisions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract for sale.

A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing.

(b) In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which use could have been prohibited. Exceptional circumstances include a material and prejudicial change of position before acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable.

(a) In addition to or in lieu of injunctive relief, a claimant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret. (b) If willful and malicious misappropriation is proven by clear and convincing evidence, the fact finder may award exemplary damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under Subsection (a). Added by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., Ch. 10 (S.B. 953 ), Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 2013. Amended by: Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 37 (H.B. 1995 ), Sec. 3, eff. September 1, 2017. Sec. 134A.005. ATTORNEY'S FEES.

Added by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., Ch. 10 (S.B. 953 ), Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 2013. Amended by: Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 37 (H.B. 1995 ), Sec. 4, eff. September 1, 2017. Sec. 134A.006. PRESERVATION OF SECRECY. (a) In an action under this chapter, a court shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable means. There is a presumption in favor of granting protective orders to preserve the secrecy of trade secrets. Protective orders may include provisions limiting access to confidential information to only the attorneys and their experts, holding in camera hearings, sealing the records of the action, and ordering any person involved in the litigation not to disclose an alleged trade secret without prior court approval. (b) In an action under this chapter, a presumption exists that a party is allowed to participate and assist counsel in the presentation of the party's case. At any stage of the action, the court may exclude a party and the party's representative or limit a party's access to the alleged trade secret of another party if other countervailing interests overcome the presumption. In making this determination, the court must conduct a balancing test that considers: (1) the value of an owner's alleged trade secret; (2) the degree of competitive harm an owner would suffer from the dissemination of the owner's alleged trade secret to the other party; (3) whether the owner is alleging that the other party is already in possession of the alleged trade secret; (4) whether a party's representative acts as a competitive decision maker; (5) the degree to which a party's defense would be impaired by limiting that party's access to the alleged trade secret; (6) whether a party or a party's representative possesses specialized expertise that would not be available to a party's outside expert; and (7) the stage of the action. Added by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., Ch. 10 (S.B. 953 ), Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 2013. Amended by: Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 37 (H.B. 1995 ), Sec. 5, eff. September 1, 2017. Sec. 134A.007. EFFECT ON OTHER LAW. (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b), this chapter displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary, and other law of this state providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret. (b) This chapter does not affect: (1) contractual remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; (2) other civil remedies that are not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; or (3) criminal remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret. (c) To the extent that this chapter conflicts with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, this chapter controls. Notwithstanding Section 22.004 , Government Code, the supreme court may not amend or adopt rules in conflict with this chapter. (d) This chapter does not affect the disclosure of public information by a governmental body under Chapter 552 , Government Code. Added by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., Ch. 10 (S.B. 953 ), Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 2013. Sec. 134A.008. UNIFORMITY OF APPLICATION AND CONSTRUCTION.

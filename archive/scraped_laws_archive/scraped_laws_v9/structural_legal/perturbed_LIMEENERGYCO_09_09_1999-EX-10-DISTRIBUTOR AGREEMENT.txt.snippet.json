Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user. The Company shall not be liable for defective Products, except as provided in this Agreement. The Distributor at all times shall comply with all requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act and similar federal and state laws and regulations.",

The Company shall not be liable for defective Products, except as provided in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The clause requiring the Distributor to comply with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act has been removed from the warranty section. This could lead to the distributor not being aware of their obligations under the Act and thus non-compliance. The altered text suggests Company makes no requirements of the distributor, potentially limiting the distributors liability.",

        "law_explanation": "15 U.S. Code § 2302 stipulates the rules regarding disclosure of warranty terms, and by removing the explicit statement that the Distributor must comply with it and relevant regulations within the warranty section, the contract makes it less clear that the distributor has obligations under this Act. This lack of clarity makes the disclosure not conspicuous, which could be viewed as a violation of the Act. There are requirements of clear disclosure and duties.",

        "scraped_snippet_2": "contract | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you contract A contract is an agreement between parties , creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law . The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent , expressed by a valid offer and acceptance ; adequate consideration ; capacity ; and legality . In some states , elements of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. Possible remedies for breach of contract include general damages , consequential damages , reliance damages , and specific performance . Background : Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. Contract law is generally governed by state common law , and while general overall contract law is common throughout the country, some specific court interpretations of a particular element of the contract may vary between the states. If a promise is breached, the law provides remedies to the harmed party, often in the form of monetary damages, or in limited circumstances, in the form of specific performance of the promise made. Elements -- Consideration and Mutual Assent Contracts arise when a duty comes into existence, because of a promise made by one of the parties. To be legally binding as a contract, a promise must be exchanged for adequate consideration. There are two different theories or definitions of consideration: Bargain Theory of Consideration and Benefit-Detriment theory of consideration. Benefit-Detriment Under the b enefit-detriment theory, an adequate consideration exists only when a promise made to the benefit of the promisor or to the detriment of the promisee, which reasonably and fairly induces the promisor to make a promise for something else for the promisee. For example, promises that are purely gifts are not considered enforceable because the personal satisfaction the grantor of the promise may receive from the act of generosity is normally not considered sufficient detriment to constitute adequate consideration. Bargain-for-Exchange Under Bargain-for-Exchange theory of consideration, adequate consideration exists when a promisor makes a promise in return for something else. Here, the essential condition is that the promisor was given something specifically to induce the promise being made. In other words, the bargain for exchange theory is different from the detriment-benefit theory in that the focus in bargain for exchange theory seems to be the parties’ motive for making the promises and the parties’ subjective mutual assent, while in detriment benefit theory, the focus seems to be an objective legal detriment or benefit to the parties. Governing Laws Contracts are mainly governed by state statutory and common (judge-made) law and private law (i.e. the private agreement). Private law principally includes the terms of the agreement between the parties who are exchanging promises. This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. Statutory law, such as the Statute of Fraud , may require some kinds of contracts be put in writing and executed with particular formalities, for the contract to be enforceable. Otherwise, the parties may enter into a binding agreement without signing a formal written document. For example, Virginia Supreme Court has held in Lucy v. Zehmer that even an agreement made on a piece of napkin can be considered a valid contract, if the parties were both sane, and showed mutual assent and consideration. Most of the principles of the common law of contracts are outlined in the Restatement of Law, Second Contracts published by the American Law Institute. The Uniform Commercial Code , whose original articles have been adopted in nearly every state, represents a body of statutory law that governs important categories of contracts. The main articles that deal with the law of contracts are Article 1 (General Provisions) and Article 2 (Sales) . Sections of Article 9 (",

ARBITRATION In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",

SIGNIFICANCE OF HEADINGS Section headings contained herein are solely for the purpose of aiding in speedy location of subject matter and are not in any sense to be given weight in the construction of this Agreement. Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the construction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though such section headings had been omitted. 33.

        "explanation": "By placing the arbitration clause within the section regarding headings, it diminishes its prominence and makes it less likely that a party will recognize its importance. This could be seen as burying the clause in an irrelevant section.",

CONFIDENTIALITY Both parties understand that the contents of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, all amounts paid or to be paid and any additional consideration, are extremely confidential, and that disclosure of same to any third party could be detrimental to the interests of one or both parties. Therefore, both parties agree not to disclose the terms of this Agreement, without the permission of the other party, to any third party other than to CONSULTANT'S business, legal and financial advisors, and with respect to all such advisors, CONSULTANT shall take all reasonable steps to ensure such confidentiality to ADAMS GOLF. Furthermore, CONSULTANT recognizes that during the course of performing his duties hereunder he may become aware of proprietary, confidential information concerning ADAMS GOLF, its PRODUCT, methods, processes, billing practices, financial condition, etc., or information ADAMS GOLF designates as confidential (collectively \"Confidential Information\"). CONSULTANT agrees that he will maintain in confidence and not disclose to any third party at any time any such Confidential Information and shall not use any such information to the detriment of ADAMS GOLF or for any purpose not contemplated by the Agreement. 25.

        "law_explanation": "The modification introduces an ambiguity that undermines the clarity and enforceability of the jury trial waiver. By stating that the provisions are 'subject to exceptions as defined in EXHIBIT Z,' it creates uncertainty about the scope of the waiver and could potentially allow a party to argue that their claim falls within one of the exceptions, thereby preserving their right to a jury trial, contrary to the original intention of the waiver. According to the 7th Amendment, jury trials have to be 'preserved', this modification undermines this amendment.",

Depending on the exact setting, good faith may require an honest belief or purpose, faithful performance of duties , observance of fair dealing standards, or an absence of fraudulent intent . A fiduciary relationship creates a duty of good faith between the agent and the principal . The breach of this duty of good faith can lead to liability . Failure to act in good faith is known as bad faith and is generally considered to be a level of culpability greater than negligence .

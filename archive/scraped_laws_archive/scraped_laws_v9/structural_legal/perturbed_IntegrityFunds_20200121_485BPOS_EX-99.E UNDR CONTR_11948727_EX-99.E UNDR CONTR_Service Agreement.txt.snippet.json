        "explanation": "The added clause 'This agreement is subject to changes at the discretion of Integrity Funds Distributor, LLC.' after the termination clause contradicts the original termination clause, which requires specific conditions and approval for termination, and also conflicts with Section 8.5, which requires amendments be agreed upon by both parties with the same formality as the original agreement.

Allowing Integrity Funds Distributor, LLC, to unilaterally change the agreement's terms without such approval violates this requirement of ongoing mutual consent and oversight, making the contract potentially unenforceable.",

        "explanation": "The 'Injunctive Relief' clause, crucial for enforcement of non-compete agreements, is moved to a position after the 'Delay' clause.

While there are exceptions, the courts require strict interpretation and clear, conspicuous language regarding the remedies for breach, including injunctive relief. By burying the injunctive relief clause within less relevant clauses, the contract diminishes the clarity and enforceability of the non-compete aspect, potentially conflicting with how California courts interpret such agreements.",

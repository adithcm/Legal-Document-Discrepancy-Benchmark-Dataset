In this capacity, Bravatek will use its best efforts to provide the following services to COMPANY. 9) Governing Law This Agreement is entered into in the State of Texas and shall be interpreted according to the laws of the State of Texas.",
        "explanation": "Moving the governing law clause to the section describing duties obscures its importance and makes it less likely to be noticed and understood. It now appears to be part of Bravatek's duties rather than a fundamental aspect of the contract.",

        "law_explanation": "Texas law requires choice of law provisions to be conspicuous to ensure enforceability. By burying the governing law clause within a section detailing Bravatek's duties, it becomes less conspicuous and could be argued as not fairly presented to both parties, potentially undermining its enforceability.",

(e) The \"remaining economic life of the goods\" and \"reasonably predictable\" fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement must be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into. Amended by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 542, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 2003. Sec. 1.204. VALUE. Except as otherwise provided in Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 , a person gives value for rights if the person acquires them: (1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately available credit, whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in the event of difficulties in collection; (2) as security for, or in total or partial satisfaction of, a preexisting claim; (3) by accepting delivery under a preexisting contract for purchase; or (4) in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. Amended by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 542, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 2003. Sec. 1.205. REASONABLE TIME; SEASONABLENESS. (a) Whether a time for taking an action required by this title is reasonable depends on the nature, purpose, and circumstances of the action. (b) An action is taken seasonably if it is taken at or within the time agreed or, if no time is agreed, at or within a reasonable time. Amended by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 542, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 2003. Sec. 1.206. PRESUMPTIONS. Whenever this title creates a \"presumption\" with respect to a fact, or provides that a fact is \"presumed,\" the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact unless and until evidence is introduced that supports a finding of its nonexistence. Amended by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 542, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 2003. SUBCHAPTER C. TERRITORIAL APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL RULES Sec. 1.301. TERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF THE TITLE; PARTIES' POWER TO CHOOSE APPLICABLE LAW. (a) Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to another state or nation the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties. Failing such agreement this title applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state. (b) Where one of the following provisions of this title specifies the applicable law, that provision governs and a contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) so specified: Rights of creditors against sold goods. Section 2.402 . Applicability of the chapter on Leases. Sections 2A.105 and 2A.106 . Applicability of the chapter on Bank Deposits and Collections. Section 4.102 .

        "explanation": "Moving the compensation clause under the modifications clause makes it harder to locate and could be argued as obscuring the intended payment terms.

However, if the contract states that the price can be altered as per modification clauses, that could be challenged.",

The obligation of the seller is to transfer and deliver and that of the buyer is to accept and pay in accordance with the contract. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1967. Sec. 2.302. UNCONSCIONABLE CONTRACT OR CLAUSE. (a) If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result. (b) When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1967. Sec. 2.303. ALLOCATION OR DIVISION OF RISKS. Where this chapter allocates a risk or a burden as between the parties \"unless otherwise agreed\", the agreement may not only shift the allocation but may also divide the risk or burden. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1967. Sec. 2.304. PRICE PAYABLE IN MONEY, GOODS, REALTY, OR OTHERWISE. (a) The price can be made payable in money or otherwise. If it is payable in whole or in part in goods each party is a seller of the goods which he is to transfer. (b) Even though all or part of the price is payable in an interest in realty the transfer of the goods and the seller's obligations with reference to them are subject to this chapter, but not the transfer of the interest in realty or the transferor's obligations in connection therewith. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1967. Sec. 2.305. OPEN PRICE TERM. (a) The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for delivery if (1) nothing is said as to price; or (2) the price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree; or (3) the price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded. (b) A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith. (c) When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to be fixed through fault of one party the other may at his option treat the contract as cancelled or himself fix a reasonable price. (d) Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract. In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account. Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 2343, ch. 785, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1967. Sec. 2.306. OUTPUT, REQUIREMENTS AND EXCLUSIVE DEALINGS. (a) A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded. (b) A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale.

The obligation of non-disclosure shall not apply to the following: a. Information at or after such time that is publicly available through no fault of either party b. Information at or after such time that is disclosed to either party by a third party entitled to disclose such information c. Information which is required by law to be disclosed to federal, state or local authorities. 10) Indemnification COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of COMPANY or breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

        "explanation": "Moving the indemnification clause after the confidentiality clause disrupts the logical flow of the contract. Indemnification clauses are crucial for risk allocation.

        "changed_text": "(b) The Remarketing Agents should endeavor (i) to use efforts to remarket the Remarketed Securities tendered or deemed tendered to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing, (ii) to establish the Reset Rates in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures and to notify the Company, the Trustee and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent promptly of the Reset Rates and (iii) to carry out such other duties as are assigned to the Remarketing Agents in the Remarketing Procedures, potentially in accordance with the provisions of the Remarketing Procedures.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'agree to use commercially reasonable efforts' to 'should endeavor to use efforts' weakens the obligation. Adding 'potentially in accordance with' introduces uncertainty. This makes it unclear to what extent the Remarketing Agents are legally bound to the Remarketing Procedures.",

        "law_explanation": "FINRA Rule 5270 prohibits front-running, which involves trading based on advance knowledge of a customer's block order. By weakening the Remarketing Agents' obligation to strictly adhere to remarketing procedures, the modified text creates a loophole. This could allow them to exploit knowledge of impending trades for their own benefit without clear repercussions, directly contradicting the intent of Rule 5270 which expects a very strict interpretation of fairness and transparency, i.e. commercially reasonable efforts would not be deemed sufficient under many circumstances. Also, this creates ambiguity around what procedures are applicable to this process.",

        "changed_text": "On the Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agents will attempt to determine a rate per annum, roughly around the nearest one-thousandth of one percent (0.001%), that each tranche of Securities could bear (which rate might apply to all Securities of the applicable tranche whether or not such Securities were included in the Remarketing) (the \"Reset Rate\") in order for each tranche of the Remarketed Securities to generate cash proceeds from the Remarketing, ideally reaching the Remarketing Price allocable to that tranche and that, in their assessment, might enable them to remarket all Remarketed Securities of such tranche tendered or deemed tendered for purchase in such Remarketing around the Remarketing Price allocable to that tranche; it is considered that each such Reset Rate need not be the same for each tranche of Securities; provided, however, that, unless such requirement has been somewhat addressed by the Company, the Reset Rate should generally not exceed an estimated market yield, loosely assessed by the Remarketing Agents, of a benchmark U.S. treasury security with a remaining maturity that mostly fits the period from the Remarketing Settlement Date until the Stated Maturity of the applicable tranche of the Securities (after giving effect to the change in the Stated Maturity of each tranche of the Securities on the Remarketing Settlement Date pursuant to the Indenture), plus possibly around 750 basis points per annum; it is further considered that neither Reset Rate should go far below 0% per annum.",
        "explanation": "Numerous changes introduce ambiguity: 'shall determine' becomes 'will attempt to determine', 'rounded to the nearest' becomes 'roughly around', 'might apply', 'ideally reaching', 'in their assessment', 'might enable', 'around the Remarketing Price', 'somewhat addressed by the Company', 'should generally not exceed an estimated market yield, loosely assessed by the Remarketing Agents', 'mostly fits', 'possibly around', 'should go far below'. These weaken the obligation to set a precise, fair Reset Rate based on market conditions. It is more vague about the exact criteria, offering significant leeway to the Remarketing Agents.",

The modified text introduces significant ambiguity in how the Reset Rate is determined, opening the door for the Remarketing Agents to manipulate the rate for their benefit or the benefit of select parties. The changes suggest a less precise and potentially unfair process for determining the rate. This contradicts the core purpose of Rule 10b-5, as it fosters a lack of transparency and potentially allows for manipulative practices in the securities remarketing process. The rule expects transparency in order to prevent fraud. The rule also suggests rates might not apply to all securities within the applicable tranche, opening the door for some securities to be preferred, something against the spirit of this law.",

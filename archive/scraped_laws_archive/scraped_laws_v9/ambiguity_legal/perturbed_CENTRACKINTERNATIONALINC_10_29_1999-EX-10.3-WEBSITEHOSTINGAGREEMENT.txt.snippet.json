        "changed_text": "i-on will generally maintain the operation of the Hosted Site, except for occasional maintenance to the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing the commitment to 'continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week' with the vague term 'generally maintain'. The specific mention of 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance' is replaced with 'occasional maintenance', making it unclear when and how often maintenance can occur.

By creating a vague obligation for website maintenance, the modified clause could be interpreted as a deceptive practice if i-on frequently interrupts service without clear justification, as it contradicts the originally stated continuous uptime commitment. The ambiguity prevents the customer from reasonably expecting reliable service, thereby potentially violating FDUTPA.",

While this section covers many things, a core idea is that businesses have a legal obligation to conduct themselves in a non-fraudulent manner. By weakening the compliance clause, the contract suggests that compliance is optional. This could be problematic if the customer engages in fraudulent activities on the hosted site. If the customer only 'endeavors' to comply with laws, the ambiguity undermines the original intention to prevent illegal activities, indirectly contradicting the statutes prohibiting fraudulent practices.",

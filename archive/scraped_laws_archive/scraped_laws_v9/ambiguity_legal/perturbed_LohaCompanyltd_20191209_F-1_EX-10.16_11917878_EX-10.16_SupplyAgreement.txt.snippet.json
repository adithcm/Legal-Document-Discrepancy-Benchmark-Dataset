Changing 'shall be liable' to 'may be liable' introduces uncertainty about the seller's responsibility for damages due to improper packing.

        "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities. Replacing \"7 days\" with \"a reasonable time\" makes the claim period vague and subjective. Changing \"be found not in conformity\" to \"appear not in conformity\" lowers the standard of proof required. Removing the specification of the China Commodity Inspection Bureau and adding \"if they obtain an Inspection Certificate\" makes the required inspection process unclear and optional. Replacing \"have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation\" with \"may attempt to claim for compensation\" weakens the buyer's rights.

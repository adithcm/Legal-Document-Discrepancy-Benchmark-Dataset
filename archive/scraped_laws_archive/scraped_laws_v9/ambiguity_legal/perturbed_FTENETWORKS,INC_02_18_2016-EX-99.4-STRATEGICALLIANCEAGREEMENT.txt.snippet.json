A copy of the (i) certificate(s) of insurance and (ii) endorsements, ideally acceptable to EDGE, should be submitted to EDGE prior to commencement of any Work and renewals or replacements of such certificates should be so delivered close to 30 days prior to the expiration or termination of each such policy.

        "explanation": "The changes weaken the obligation to obtain and maintain insurance by using 'endeavor' instead of 'shall.' The phrase 'ideally acceptable' introduces subjectivity, and replacing 'shall' with 'should' makes timely submission of insurance documents non-mandatory. 'May be made available' weakens the requirement to provide insurance policies.",

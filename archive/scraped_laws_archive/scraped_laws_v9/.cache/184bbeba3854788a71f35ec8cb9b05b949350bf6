            <div class="nys-openleg-result-text">  &sect; 3420. Liability insurance; standard provisions; right of injured<br />person. (a) No policy or contract insuring against liability for injury<br />to person, except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, or<br />against liability for injury to, or destruction of, property shall be<br />issued or delivered in this state, unless it contains in substance the<br />following provisions or provisions that are equally or more favorable to<br />the insured and to judgment creditors so far as such provisions relate<br />to judgment creditors:<br /><br />(1) A provision that the insolvency or bankruptcy of the person<br />insured, or the insolvency of the insured&#039;s estate, shall not release<br />the insurer from the payment of damages for injury sustained or loss<br />occasioned during the life of and within the coverage of such policy or<br />contract.<br /><br />(2) A provision that in case judgment against the insured or the<br />insured&#039;s personal representative in an action brought to recover<br />damages for injury sustained or loss or damage occasioned during the<br />life of the policy or contract shall remain unsatisfied at the<br />expiration of thirty days from the serving of notice of entry of<br />judgment upon the attorney for the insured, or upon the insured, and<br />upon the insurer, then an action may, except during a stay or limited<br />stay of execution against the insured on such judgment, be maintained<br />against the insurer under the terms of the policy or contract for the<br />amount of such judgment not exceeding the amount of the applicable limit<br />of coverage under such policy or contract.<br /><br />(3) A provision that notice given by or on behalf of the insured, or<br />written notice by or on behalf of the injured person or any other<br />claimant, to any licensed agent of the insurer in this state, with<br />particulars sufficient to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice<br />to the insurer.<br /><br />(4) A provision that failure to give any notice required to be given<br />by such policy within the time prescribed therein shall not invalidate<br />any claim made by the insured, an injured person or any other claimant<br />if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to give such<br />notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as<br />was reasonably possible thereafter.<br /><br />(5) A provision that failure to give any notice required to be given<br />by such policy within the time prescribed therein shall not invalidate<br />any claim made by the insured, injured person or any other claimant,<br />unless the failure to provide timely notice has prejudiced the insurer,<br />except as provided in paragraph four of this subsection. With respect to<br />a claims-made policy, however, the policy may provide that the claim<br />shall be made during the policy period, any renewal thereof, or any<br />extended reporting period, except as provided in paragraph four of this<br />subsection. As used in this paragraph, the terms &quot;claims-made policy&quot;<br />and &quot;extended reporting period&quot; shall have their respective meanings as<br />provided in a regulation promulgated by the superintendent.<br /><br />(6) A provision that, with respect to a claim arising out of death or<br />personal injury of any person, if the insurer disclaims liability or<br />denies coverage based upon the failure to provide timely notice, then<br />the injured person or other claimant may maintain an action directly<br />against such insurer, in which the sole question is the insurer&#039;s<br />disclaimer or denial based on the failure to provide timely notice,<br />unless within sixty days following such disclaimer or denial, the<br />insured or the insurer: (A) initiates an action to declare the rights of<br />the parties under the insurance policy; and (B) names the injured person<br />or other claimant as a party to the action.<br /><br />(b) Subject to the limitations and conditions of paragraph two of<br />subsection (a) of this section, an action may be maintained by the<br />following persons against the insurer upon any policy or contract of<br />liability insurance that is governed by such paragraph, to recover the<br />amount of a judgment against the insured or his personal representative:<br /><br />(1) any person who, or the personal representative of any person who,<br />has obtained a judgment against the insured or the insured&#039;s personal<br />representative, for damages for injury sustained or loss or damage<br />occasioned during the life of the policy or contract;<br /><br />(2) any person who, or the personal representative of any person who,<br />has obtained a judgment against the insured or the insured&#039;s personal<br />representative to enforce a right of contribution or indemnity, or any<br />person subrogated to the judgment creditor&#039;s rights under such judgment;<br />and<br /><br />(3) any assignee of a judgment obtained as specified in paragraph one<br />or paragraph two of this subsection, subject further to the limitation<br />contained in section 13-103 of the general obligations law.<br /><br />(c) (1) If an action is maintained against an insurer under the<br />provisions of paragraph two of subsection (a) of this section and the<br />insurer alleges in defense that the insured failed or refused to<br />cooperate with the insurer in violation of any provision in the policy<br />or contract requiring such cooperation, then the burden shall be upon<br />the insurer to prove such alleged failure or refusal to cooperate.<br /><br />(2)(A) In any action in which an insurer alleges that it was<br />prejudiced as a result of a failure to provide timely notice, the burden<br />of proof shall be on: (i) the insurer to prove that it has been<br />prejudiced, if the notice was provided within two years of the time<br />required under the policy; or (ii) the insured, injured person or other<br />claimant to prove that the insurer has not been prejudiced, if the<br />notice was provided more than two years after the time required under<br />the policy.<br /><br />(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, an<br />irrebuttable presumption of prejudice shall apply if, prior to notice,<br />the insured&#039;s liability has been determined by a court of competent<br />jurisdiction or by binding arbitration; or if the insured has resolved<br />the claim or suit by settlement or other compromise.<br /><br />(C) The insurer&#039;s rights shall not be deemed prejudiced unless the<br />failure to timely provide notice materially impairs the ability of the<br />insurer to investigate or defend the claim.<br /><br />(d)(1)(A) This paragraph applies with respect to a liability policy<br />that provides coverage with respect to a claim arising out of the death<br />or bodily injury of any person, where the policy is: (i) subject to<br />section three thousand four hundred twenty-five of this article, other<br />than an excess liability or umbrella policy; or (ii) used to satisfy a<br />financial responsibility requirement imposed by law or regulation.<br /><br />(B) Upon an insurer&#039;s receipt of a written request by an injured<br />person who has filed a claim or by another claimant, an insurer shall,<br />within sixty days of receipt of the written request: (i) confirm to the<br />injured person or other claimant in writing whether the insured had a<br />liability insurance policy of the type specified in subparagraph (A) of<br />this paragraph in effect with the insurer on the date of the alleged<br />occurrence; and (ii) specify the liability insurance limits of the<br />coverage provided under the policy.<br /><br />(C) If the injured person or other claimant fails to provide<br />sufficient identifying information to allow the insurer, in the exercise<br />of reasonable diligence, to identify a liability insurance policy that<br />may be relevant to the claim, the insurer shall within forty-five days<br />of receipt of the written request, so advise the injured person or other<br />claimant in writing and identify for the injured person or other<br />claimant the additional information needed. Within forty-five days of<br />receipt of the additional information, the insurer shall provide the<br />information required under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.<br /><br />(2) If under a liability policy issued or delivered in this state, an<br />insurer shall disclaim liability or deny coverage for death or bodily<br />injury arising out of a motor vehicle accident or any other type of<br />accident occurring within this state, it shall give written notice as<br />soon as is reasonably possible of such disclaimer of liability or denial<br />of coverage to the insured and the injured person or any other claimant.<br /><br />(e) No policy or contract of personal injury liability insurance or of<br />property damage liability insurance, covering liability arising from the<br />ownership, maintenance or operation of any motor vehicle or of any<br />vehicle as defined in section three hundred eighty-eight of the vehicle<br />and traffic law, or an aircraft, or any vessel as defined in section<br />forty-eight of the navigation law, shall be issued or delivered in this<br />state to the owner thereof, or shall be issued or delivered by any<br />authorized insurer upon any such vehicle or aircraft or vessel then<br />principally garaged or principally used in this state, unless it<br />contains a provision insuring the named insured against liability for<br />death or injury sustained, or loss or damage occasioned within the<br />coverage of the policy or contract, as a result of negligence in the<br />operation or use of such vehicle, aircraft or vessel, as the case may<br />be, by any person operating or using the same with the permission,<br />express or implied, of the named insured.<br /><br />(f) (1) No policy insuring against loss resulting from liability<br />imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any natural person<br />arising out of the ownership, maintenance and use of a motor vehicle or<br />an altered motor vehicle commonly referred to as a &quot;stretch limousine&quot;<br />having a seating capacity of eight or more passengers used in the<br />business of carrying or transporting passengers for hire, by the insured<br />shall be issued or delivered by any authorized insurer upon any motor<br />vehicle or an altered motor vehicle commonly referred to as a &quot;stretch<br />limousine&quot; having a seating capacity of eight or more passengers used in<br />the business of carrying or transporting passengers for hire, then<br />principally garaged or principally used in this state unless it contains<br />a provision whereby the insurer agrees that it will pay to the insured,<br />as defined in such provision, subject to the terms and conditions set<br />forth therein to be prescribed by the board of directors of the Motor<br />Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation and approved by the<br />superintendent, all sums, not exceeding a maximum amount or limit of<br />twenty-five thousand dollars exclusive of interest and costs, on account<br />of injury to and all sums, not exceeding a maximum amount or limit of<br />fifty thousand dollars exclusive of interest and costs, on account of<br />death of one person, in any one accident, and the maximum amount or<br />limit, subject to such limit for any one person so injured of fifty<br />thousand dollars or so killed of one hundred thousand dollars, exclusive<br />of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, more than<br />one person in any one accident, which the insured or his legal<br />representative shall be entitled to recover as damages from an owner or<br />operator of an uninsured motor vehicle, unidentified motor vehicle which<br />leaves the scene of an accident, a motor vehicle registered in this<br />state as to which at the time of the accident there was not in effect a<br />policy of liability insurance, a stolen vehicle, a motor vehicle<br />operated without permission of the owner, an insured motor vehicle where<br />the insurer disclaims liability or denies coverage or an unregistered<br />vehicle because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death<br />resulting therefrom, sustained by the insured, caused by accident<br />occurring in this state and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or<br />use of such motor vehicle. No payment for non-economic loss shall be<br />made under such policy provision to a covered person unless such person<br />has incurred a serious injury, as such terms are defined in section five<br />thousand one hundred two of this chapter. Such policy shall not<br />duplicate any element of basic economic loss provided for under article<br />fifty-one of this chapter. No payments of first party benefits for basic<br />economic loss made pursuant to such article shall diminish the<br />obligations of the insurer under this policy provision for the payment<br />of non-economic loss and economic loss in excess of basic economic loss.<br />Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of section three thousand<br />four hundred twenty-five of this article, any such policy which does not<br />contain the aforesaid provisions shall be construed as if such<br />provisions were embodied therein.<br /><br />(2) (A) Any such policy shall, at the option of the insured, also<br />provide supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance for<br />bodily injury, in an amount up to the bodily injury liability insurance<br />limits of coverage provided under such policy, subject to a maximum of<br />two hundred fifty thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death<br />of one person in any one accident and, subject to such limit for one<br />person, up to five hundred thousand dollars because of bodily injury to<br />or death of two or more persons in any one accident, or a combined<br />single limit policy of five hundred thousand dollars because of bodily<br />injury to or death of one or more persons in any one accident; and any<br />such policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by<br />law for bodily injury or death suffered by any natural person arising<br />out of the ownership, maintenance, and use of an altered motor vehicle<br />commonly referred to as a &quot;stretch limousine&quot; having a seating capacity<br />of eight or more passengers used in the business of carrying or<br />transporting passengers for hire, shall provide supplementary<br />uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance for bodily injury, in an<br />amount of a combined single limit of one million five hundred thousand<br />dollars because of bodily injury or death of one or more persons in any<br />one accident. Provided however, an insurer issuing any such policy,<br />except a policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed<br />by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any natural person arising<br />out of the ownership, maintenance, and use of an altered motor vehicle<br />commonly referred to as a &quot;stretch limousine&quot; having a seating capacity<br />of eight or more passengers used in the business of carrying or<br />transporting passengers for hire, in lieu of offering to the insured the<br />coverages stated above, may provide supplementary uninsured/underinsured<br />motorists insurance for bodily injury, in an amount up to the bodily<br />injury liability insurance limits of coverage provided under such<br />policy, subject to a maximum of one hundred thousand dollars because of<br />bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and, subject<br />to such limit for one person, up to three hundred thousand dollars<br />because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one<br />accident, or a combined single limit policy of three hundred thousand<br />dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one or more persons in<br />any one accident, if such insurer also makes available a personal<br />umbrella policy with liability coverage limits up to at least five<br />hundred thousand dollars which also provides coverage for supplementary<br />uninsured/underinsured motorists claims. Supplementary<br />uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance shall provide coverage, in<br />any state or Canadian province, if the limits of liability under all<br />bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies of another motor<br />vehicle liable for damages are in a lesser amount than the bodily injury<br />liability insurance limits of coverage provided by such policy. Upon<br />written request by any insured covered by supplemental<br />uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance or his duly authorized<br />representative and upon disclosure by the insured of the insured&#039;s<br />bodily injury and supplemental uninsured/underinsured motorists<br />insurance coverage limits, the insurer of any other owner or operator of<br />another motor vehicle against which a claim has been made for damages to<br />the insured shall disclose, within forty-five days of the request, the<br />bodily injury liability insurance limits of its coverage provided under<br />the policy or all bodily injury liability bonds. The time of the insured<br />to make any supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorist claim, shall<br />be tolled during the period the insurer of any other owner or operator<br />of another motor vehicle that may be liable for damages to the insured,<br />fails to so disclose its coverage. As a condition precedent to the<br />obligation of the insurer to pay under the supplementary<br />uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance coverage, the limits of<br />liability of all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies<br />applicable at the time of the accident shall be exhausted by payment of<br />judgments or settlements. As used in this subsection, &quot;motor vehicle&quot;<br />shall include fire vehicles, as defined in section one hundred fifteen-a<br />of the vehicle and traffic law, and police vehicles, as defined in<br />section one hundred thirty-two-a of the vehicle and traffic law.<br /><br />(B) In addition to the notice provided, upon issuance of a policy of<br />motor vehicle liability insurance pursuant to regulations promulgated by<br />the superintendent, insurers shall notify insureds, in writing, of the<br />availability of supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage.<br />Such notification shall contain an explanation of supplementary<br />uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage and the amounts in which it<br />can be purchased. Subsequently, a notification of availability shall be<br />provided at least once a year and may be simplified pursuant to<br />regulations promulgated by the superintendent, but must include a<br />concise statement that supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists<br />coverage is available, an explanation of such coverage, and the coverage<br />limits that can be purchased from the insurer.<br /><br />* (2-a) (A) Notwithstanding paragraph two of this subsection, this<br />paragraph shall apply to any new insurance policy or contract subject to<br />this subsection entered into after the effective date of this paragraph.<br />This paragraph shall not be deemed to apply to any policies originally<br />entered into prior to the effective date of this paragraph, but renewed<br />after the effective date of this paragraph, or to any policy of<br />commercial risk insurance. Any new insurance policy or contract entered<br />into after the effective date of this paragraph shall, at the option of<br />the first named insured, also provide supplementary<br />uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance for bodily injury, in an<br />amount equal to the bodily injury liability insurance limits of coverage<br />provided under such motor vehicle liability insurance policy; provided,<br />however, that a first named insured may exercise the choice to decline<br />such supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance or select<br />a lower amount of coverage through a written waiver signed, or<br />electronically signed, by such insured, subject to the requirements of<br />subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. Supplementary uninsured/underinsured<br />motorists insurance shall provide coverage, in any state or Canadian<br />province, if the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability<br />bonds and insurance policies of any other motor vehicle liable for<br />damages are in a lesser amount than the bodily injury liability<br />insurance limits of coverage provided by such policy. Upon written<br />request by any insured covered by supplemental uninsured/underinsured<br />motorists insurance or a duly authorized representative and upon<br />disclosure by the insured of the insured&#039;s bodily injury and<br />supplemental uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance coverage limits,<br />the insurer of any other owner or operator of another motor vehicle<br />against which a claim has been made for damages to the insured shall<br />disclose, within forty-five days of the request, the bodily injury<br />liability insurance limits of its coverage provided under the policy or<br />all bodily injury liability bonds. The time of the insured to make any<br />supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorist claim, shall be tolled<br />during the period the insurer of any other owner or operator of another<br />motor vehicle that may be liable for damages to the insured, fails to so<br />disclose its coverage. As a condition precedent to the obligation of the<br />insurer to pay under the supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists<br />insurance coverage, the limits of liability of all bodily injury<br />liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the<br />accident shall be exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.<br /><br />(B) In addition to the notice provided, upon issuance of a policy of<br />motor vehicle liability insurance pursuant to regulations promulgated by<br />the superintendent, insurers shall notify insureds, in writing, of the<br />availability of supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage.<br />Such notification shall contain an explanation of supplementary<br />uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage and the amounts in which it<br />can be purchased. Subsequently, a notification of availability shall be<br />provided at least once a year and may be simplified pursuant to<br />regulations promulgated by the superintendent, but must include a<br />concise statement that supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists<br />coverage is available, an explanation of such coverage, and the coverage<br />limits that can be purchased from the insurer. If an insured elects to<br />reject supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage or select<br />a lower amount of supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage<br />than the bodily injury liability insurance limits of coverage provided<br />under the insured&#039;s motor vehicle liability insurance policy, the<br />selection of lower supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists<br />coverage or rejection of such coverage must be made on a written or<br />electronic form provided to the first named insured. Such form shall<br />also advise that such coverage is equal to the insured&#039;s bodily injury<br />liability limits under the motor vehicle liability insurance policy<br />unless lower limits are requested or the coverage is rejected.<br /><br />(i) The form shall also advise that supplementary<br />uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage (sum coverage) provides<br />insurance protection for any person included as insured under your<br />policy if he or she is injured in an accident involving another motor<br />vehicle whose owner or operator was negligent but who has either no<br />bodily injury or liability insurance, or less than the insurance you<br />carry.

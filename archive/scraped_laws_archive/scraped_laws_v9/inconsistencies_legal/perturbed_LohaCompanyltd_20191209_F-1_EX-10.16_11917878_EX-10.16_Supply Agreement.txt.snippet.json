While not a strict law, deviations from standard practices, such as excessively long periods for opening letters of credit (here, modified to 60 days), could be challenged if they cause undue delay or prejudice to the seller, potentially violating the spirit of good faith and reasonable timing implied in UCP 600.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 39 of CISG requires the buyer to examine the goods 'within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances' and to notify the seller of any non-conformity 'within a reasonable time' after discovery. A 1-day inspection period is almost certainly not a 'reasonable time' under most circumstances, making the modified clause likely unenforceable.",

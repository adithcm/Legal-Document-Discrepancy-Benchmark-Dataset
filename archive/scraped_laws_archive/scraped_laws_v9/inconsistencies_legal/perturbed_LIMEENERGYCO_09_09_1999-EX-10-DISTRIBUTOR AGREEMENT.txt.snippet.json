For information concerning the relationship between statutes and Public Acts, refer to the Guide . Because the statute database is maintained primarily for legislative drafting purposes, statutory changes are sometimes included in the statute database before they take effect.

(Source: P.A. 86-1324.) 45 ILCS 40/1 (45 ILCS 40/1) (from Ch. 91 1/2, par. 50-1) Sec. 1. The Interstate Compact on Mental Health is approved and adopted as law in this State and entered into by this State with all other states, as defined in paragraph (h) of Article II of such Compact, which legally join therein. The form and substance of such Compact is substantially as follows: The contracting States solemnly agree that: ARTICLE I The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare. ARTICLE II As used in this compact: (a) \"Sending state\" shall mean a party state from which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or from which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent. (b) \"Receiving state\" shall mean a party state to which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or to which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent. (c) \"Institution\" shall mean any hospital or other facility maintained by a party ",

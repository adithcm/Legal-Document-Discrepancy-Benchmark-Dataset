        "scraped_snippet_2": "s individual investors to bring civil actions under several provisions: Section 11 makes issuers strictly liable for registration statements that contain \"an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required...to make the statements therein not misleading.\" Under this provision, a purchaser of the security can bring suit under Section 11, even if he bought the security after the initial offering, on the secondary markets. As long as the purchaser can trace the purchase back to the initial offering and is within the statute of limitations, he can sue; there is no need to prove causation or reliance on the misstatements or omissions. Damages are limited to the difference between the offering price and value of the securities at the time of the lawsuit. Although the purchaser can sue the issuer, underwriter, or subsequent seller, all defendants but the issuer have a “due diligence\" defense that they had no grounds to believe the statement had a misstatement or omission. Section 5 and Section 12(a)(1) allow purchasers to sue sellers for offering or selling a non-exempt security without registering it. As long as the purchaser can prove a direct link between the purchaser and the seller, and the suit is within the statute of limitations, the purchaser may obtain rescission with interest, or damages if the investor sold his securities for less than he purchased them. Section 12(a)(2) creates liability for any person who offers or sells a security through a prospectus or an oral communication containing a material misstatement or omission . The person is liable to the purchaser for rescission of the purchase or damages, provided that the purchaser did not know about the misstatement or omission at the time of the purchase. Court holdings imply that the cause of action only applies to purchasers in the initial offering, not secondary purchases, but this is not settled law yet. Investors suing under 12(a)(2) can only recover from sellers. Section 15 aids investors by making \"control persons,\" or persons who \"control\" defendants liable under Sections 11 and 12 by owning stock or under agency principals, jointly and severally liable . This helps investors collect damages in cases where the defendant is insolvent or does not have enough money to pay the investor, a frequent situation in securities litigation (most investors sue after their investment has soured). Section 17(a) is a key anti-fraud provision in the Securities Act. It provides for liability for fraudulent sales of securities. Some courts have found an implied right of private action under this provision, though this is becoming a less favored position. However, some courts continue to accept private suits under this provision. Section 17(a) makes it unlawful to \"employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud\", \"obtain money or property\" by using material misstatements or omissions, or to \"engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.\" This provision is closely tracked by Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 , which is used more widely by investors suing for fraud.

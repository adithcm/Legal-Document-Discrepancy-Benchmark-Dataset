Bargain-for-Exchange Under Bargain-for-Exchange theory of consideration, adequate consideration exists when a promisor makes a promise in return for something else. Here, the essential condition is that the promisor was given something specifically to induce the promise being made. In other words, the bargain for exchange theory is different from the detriment-benefit theory in that the focus in bargain for exchange theory seems to be the parties’ motive for making the promises and the parties’ subjective mutual assent, while in detriment benefit theory, the focus seems to be an objective legal detriment or benefit to the parties. Governing Laws Contracts are mainly governed by state statutory and common (judge-made) law and private law (i.e. the private agreement). Private law principally includes the terms of the agreement between the parties who are exchanging promises. This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. Statutory law, such as the Statute of Fraud , may require some kinds of contracts be put in writing and executed with particular formalities, for the contract to be enforceable. Otherwise, the parties may enter into a binding agreement without signing a formal written document. For example, Virginia Supreme Court has held in Lucy v. Zehmer that even an agreement made on a piece of napkin can be considered a valid contract, if the parties were both sane, and showed mutual assent and consideration. Most of the principles of the common law of contracts are outlined in the Restatement of Law, Second Contracts published by the American Law Institute. The Uniform Commercial Code , whose original articles have been adopted in nearly every state, represents a body of statutory law that governs important categories of contracts. The main articles that deal with the law of contracts are Article 1 (General Provisions) and Article 2 (Sales) . Sections of Article 9 (Secured Transactions) govern contracts assigning the rights to payment in security interest agreements. Contracts related to particular activities or business sectors may be highly regulated by state and/or federal law. In 1988, the United States joined the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods which now governs contracts within its scope. Remedies for Breach of Contract -- Damages If the agreement does not meet the legal requirements to be considered a valid contract, the “contractual agreement” will not be enforced by the law, and the breaching party will not need to indemnify the non-breaching party. That is, the plaintiff (non-breaching party) in a contractual dispute suing the breaching party may only win expectation damages when they are able to show that the alleged contractual agreement actually existed and was a valid and enforceable contract. In such a case, expectation damages will be rewarded, which attempts to make the non-breaching party whole, by awarding the amount of money that the party would have made had there not been a breach in the agreement plus any reasonably foreseeable consequential damages suffered as a result of the breach. However, it is important to note that there are no punitive damages for contractual remedies, and the non-breaching party may not be awarded more than the expectancy (monetary value of the contract, had it been fully performed). However, in certain circumstances, certain promises that are not considered contracts may be enforced to a limited extent. If one party has made reasonable reliance to his detriment on the assurances/promises of the other party, the court may apply an equitable doctrine of Promissory Estoppel to award the non-breaching party a reliance damages to compensate the party for the amount suffered as a result of the party’s reasonable reliance on the agreement. In another circumstance, the court ",

Due to the frequency of breaches of contract, a robust body of law has grown to resolve the ensuing disputes. The overarching goal of contract law is to place the harmed party in the same economic position they would have been in had no breach of contract occurred. As a result, the default remedy available for a breach of contract is monetary damages . Generally, these damages are limited to what is listed in the contract and, unlike damages from tort cases, courts do not award punitive damages for breaches of contract. For example, if a party agrees to pay $50,000 to have their house painted but is only willing to hand over $10,000 once the painting is complete, the court will award the painters $40,000 in damages. This hesitancy to award punitive damages is due to the theory of efficient breach which argues that breaching contracts and paying damages is sometimes economically beneficial for society as a whole. Nonetheless, in specific circumstances, a party may successfully recover more money than initially contracted for under the doctrine of reliance damages . Under this doctrine , a party who reasonably relied upon a contract that was later breached can be granted compensation for the reasonable expenses they incurred due to that reliance. For example, a party who purchases lifeguard equipment in reliance upon a pool construction contract’s fulfillment may be able to recover the costs of the lifeguard equipment in the event of a breach. Reliance damages are based upon the principle of promissory estoppel , and granting them is subject to the court’s discretion. That said, parties harmed by a breach of contract have a duty to mitigate that harm. For example, before they could recover, the aforementioned lifeguard equipment buyer must first attempt to resell the equipment to a new buyer. Failure to satisfy the duty to mitigate will result in an inability to recover damages. In scenarios where damages are insufficient, a court may instead award specific performance . Under the specific performance remedy, the breaching party must attempt to fulfill the terms of the contract as best as possible. Specific performance, however, is generally only awarded when dealing with one-of-a-kind assets like real estate . Parties wishing to contract around the above remedies can do so through the use of liquidated damages provisions. These provisions establish in advance how much money a breaching party must pay and sidestep the expensive and time-consuming process of determining the actual damage caused by the breach. While liquidated damages clauses are generally allowed, a court may strike one down if the clause appears to be proxying for punitive damages or if the terms of the clause are unconscionable .

        "explanation": "The terms 'workmanlike manner', 'fully functional and fit for their intended purposes,' and 'free from defects' are replaced with weaker, less precise terms ('generally acceptable manner', 'substantially functional and somewhat fit,' and 'mostly free from defects').

The modified text weakens these guarantees, potentially conflicting with the UCC's baseline requirements for merchantability, as 'substantially functional' and 'somewhat fit' might not meet the standard of 'ordinary purposes.' The UCC warranty of merchantability might be interpreted to mean the good 'works', not 'somewhat works'.",

Pennsylvania became the first state to adopt the UCC in 1953, and every other state followed suit over the next twenty years. News ULC Statement on Ownership of Investment Property under Uniform Commercial Code Article 8 ULC Statement on Central Bank Digital Currencies and the Uniform Commercial Code Cooperation with ALI The UCC is a joint project of the Uniform Law Commission and the American Law Institute. Recognizing that drafting a combined commercial code was a massive undertaking, the ULC invited ALI to participate in the codification project, and the ALI board accepted the invitation in 1942. Over the next ten years the two organizations collaborated at drafting meetings funded in large part by a generous grant from the Maurice and Laura Falk Foundation, with additional funding contributed from law firms, banks, and businesses that recognized the need for uniform commercial laws. The UCC Today The UCC is maintained under the guidance of the Permanent Editorial Board for the Uniform Commercial Code (PEB) , comprised of members appointed by the ULC and the ALI. The PEB, established in 1961, monitors developments in commercial law, recommends UCC amendments and revisions when necessary, and publishes official commentary to help courts interpret specific UCC provisions. An endowment established with the original Falk Foundation grant funding and replenished with UCC publishing royalties is available to fund UCC drafting projects. Articles Article 1, General Provisions Uniform Commercial Code Article 1 contains definitions and general provisions applicable as default rules to transactions covered under other articles of the UCC. Article 1 was last revised in 2001, with a few minor amendments since then to harmonize with recent revisions of other UCC articles. View Article 1, General Provisions Article 2, Sales Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 governs the sale of goods. It was part of the original Uniform Commercial Code approved in 1951. Article 2 represented a revision and modernization of the Uniform Sales Act, which was originally approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1906. The Uniform Law Commission and American Law Institute approved a revised Article 2 in 2003 that was not adopted in any state, and was subsequently withdrawn by both organizations in 2011. Thus the 1951 version of Article 2 is the most recent official version. View Article 2, Sales Article 2A, Leases Uniform Commercial Code Article 2A governs leases of personal property. It was first added to the Uniform Commercial Code in 1987 and amended in 1990. A revision was approved by the Uniform Law Commission and the American Law Institute in 2003, but was not adopted in any jurisdiction and subsequently withdrawn by both organizations in 2011. Thus, the 1987 version of Article 2A, as amended in 1990, remains the official text. View Article 2A, Leases Article 3, Negotiable Instruments Uniform Commercial Code Article 3 governs negotiable instruments: drafts (including checks) and notes representing a promise to pay a sum of money, and that have independent value because they are negotiable. An instrument is negotiable if it can be transferred to another person and remain enforceable against the person who originally made the promise to pay. The substance of Article 3 has its roots in the Negotiable Instrument Law first approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1896. That early uniform law was revised and incorporated into the original version of the UCC in 1951, and a further revision was approved in 1990. Finally, a set of amendments to UCC Articles 3 and 4 was approved in 2002.

        "changed_text": "The Distributor shall pay Company within thirty (30) days of the approximate expected receipt of Products.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'receipt of Products' to 'approximate expected receipt of Products' introduces ambiguity. The original clause ties the payment trigger to a concrete event (actual receipt). The modified clause uses a subjective and potentially inaccurate estimate, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over payment timing.

The ambiguity allows one party to manipulate the payment timeline to their advantage, undermining the fairness and certainty expected in commercial contracts.",

(Source: P.A. 85-1384.) 815 ILCS 605/2 (815 ILCS 605/2) (from Ch. 121 1/2, par. 2102) Sec. 2. The General Assembly finds and declares that: (a) The ability to obtain and use credit has become of great importance to consumers who have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness and credit standing. As a result, consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit service businesses which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers. Certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit services have worked a financial hardship upon the people of this State, often on those who are of limited economic means and inexperienced in credit matters. (b) The purpose of this Act is to provide prospective consumers of credit services companies with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of those services and to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices.

(b) \"Consumer reporting agency\" has the meaning assigned by Section 603(f), Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1681a(f)). (c) \"Extension of Credit\" means the right to defer payment of a debt or to incur a debt and defer its payment offered or granted primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (d) \"Credit Services Organization\" means a person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others and in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration, provides, or represents that the person can or will provide, any of the following service",

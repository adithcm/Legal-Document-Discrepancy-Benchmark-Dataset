        "changed_text": "As used herein, \"Business Day\" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in Delaware are authorized or required by internal policy to remain closed.",
        "explanation": "The original definition of \"Business Day\" relies on legal or executive orders, which aligns with standard legal practice. By changing it to rely on \"internal policy\" in Delaware, it creates ambiguity. If banks are open due to a legal requirement but closed due to internal policy, it is unclear if that counts as a business day. This definition conflicts with established legal interpretations and creates contractual uncertainty.",

        "law_explanation": "This New York law dictates how holidays and Saturdays are treated, specifically in relation to state-level statutes. The modified definition of 'Business Day' now includes closure days based on internal bank policies, which could be different than legal holidays. This change makes the contract deviate from the default state law regarding business days and creates the potential for disputes about timelines.",

        "explanation": "The original text refers to equitable considerations for contribution in case of liability. The modified text gives the Company the sole right to determine what is 'unjust', which can override any established legal principles of fairness or equity. This contradicts the general understanding of 'equitable' as it is used in legal contexts and shifts power heavily in favor of the Company.",

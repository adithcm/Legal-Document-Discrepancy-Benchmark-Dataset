        "explanation": "By removing 'applicable' and the specific reference to Rule 13d-1(k), the amended text becomes less precise and potentially obscures the mandatory nature of the filing requirements under securities law. The omission weakens the explicit affirmation of compliance with Rule 13d-1(k).",

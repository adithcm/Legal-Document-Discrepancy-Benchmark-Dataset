        "changed_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement may cause Franchisor injury.",
        "explanation": "Removing the clause where the member agrees to pay court costs and reasonable attorney's fees limits the franchisor's ability to recover full costs associated with enforcing the agreement. This creates a legal risk because many states have laws protecting employees from bearing certain legal fees in disputes, which would be harder to enforce without the original clause.",

        "law_explanation": "This modification contradicts 29 U.S.C. § 216 because by removing the clause requiring the member to pay attorney fees, this could be interpreted as an attempt to dissuade the member from pursuing legal action related to wage disputes or other employment-related issues, as it removes a potential source of funds to pay their fees. Though the specific violation of the FLSA will depend on the specific claim, eliminating this clause creates potential for legal challenges related to the distribution of costs to employees.",

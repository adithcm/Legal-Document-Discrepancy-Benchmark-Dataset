Each Party agrees to refrain from, either during period of this Agreement or at any other time thereafter, disclosing, using or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement.",
        "changed_text": "Each Party agrees to hold in confidence confidential information acquired in the course of this relationship with the other Parties and their associates. Each Party agrees to refrain from disclosing confidential information during the period of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'using or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement' and limiting the confidentiality restriction to 'during the period of this Agreement' significantly weakens the confidentiality clause. This omission creates a legal risk because it implies that after the agreement terminates, parties are free to use the confidential information, which could violate trade secret laws.",

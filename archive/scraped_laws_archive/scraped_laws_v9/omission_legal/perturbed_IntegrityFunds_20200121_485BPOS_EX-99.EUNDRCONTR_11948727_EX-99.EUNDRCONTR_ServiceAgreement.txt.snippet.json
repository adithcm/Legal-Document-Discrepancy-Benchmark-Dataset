By omitting the requirement to comply with all SEC rules and regulations, the modified text weakens the obligation of Integrity to avoid such practices, potentially contradicting this provision. This creates a legal risk, as Integrity might engage in practices that, while technically compliant with the Fund's Registration Statement, violate broader SEC regulations designed to protect investors from manipulation and deception.",

The Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund's being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1.",

        "law_explanation": "By removing the specification that Kansas law governs, the agreement becomes less clear about which consumer protection laws apply. The Kansas Consumer Credit Code (K.S.A. 16a-1-101 et seq.) provides specific protections for consumers in credit transactions. If the agreement involves credit transactions with Kansas residents, the omission of Kansas law could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent these consumer protections, thus creating a legal contradiction.",

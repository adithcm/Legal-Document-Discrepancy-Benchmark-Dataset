        "scraped_snippet_2": "mmittee in 1935 to solicit input from judges and practitioners and submit suggestions of rules. After solicitation and consideration, the Supreme Court approved the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938. One of the first major changes was the unity of courts of equity and law. Previously, as illustrated by the divergent treatment of procedural rules for federal courts serving as courts of equity in the Process Act of 1792 and for federal courts serving as courts of law in the Judiciary Act of 1789, the two were separate. Also, as a 1935 article in Yale Law Journal by Charles Clark and James Moore persuasively argued, many believed that any ultimate attempt to create a uniform system of procedural rules for federal courts would fail if equity and law were not united. The Advisory Committee and the Supreme Court would ultimately agree, and the new procedural rules unified the federal court’s heretofore separate roles as courts of equity and courts of law. Another major reform was the simplification of pleading requirements. Previously under the traditional formalistic common law method of pleading, as an article in Yale Law Journal by Charles Clark, History, Systems and Functions of Pleading , explains, a trial would not proceed until the parties reached a stage where one party affirmed and the other denied a single material point of contention to be ruled upon. This required extensive and technical pleading, which led to many of the miscarriages of justice that the ABA objected to in their push for reform. The reformed rules abandoned this system of pleading and allowed parties to hale their claims to court with simplified statements of their claims, and a streamlined process of objecting to and amending pleadings. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8 lays out the general rules of pleading, and only requires a plaintiff to make a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. . . and a demand for the relief sought.” Rule 12 lays out when and how defenses and objections can be presented, and overall allows only certain objections to be raised past the pleading stage to ensure that the court can speedily address the dispute in contention. Commentators, jurists, and practitioners generally considered the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to be a success. Charles Clark, a leading commentator on the reform, stated in his Yale Law Journal article, The Influence of Federal Procedural Reform , that “the universal chorus of approval is quite phenomenal.” Although the Rules have been amended many times in subsequent years, the core of original 1938 rules is still by-and-large intact.

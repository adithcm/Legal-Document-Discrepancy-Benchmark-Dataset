        "scraped_snippet_2": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934 | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you Securities Exchange Act of 1934 The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"1934 Act,\" or \"Exchange Act\") primarily regulates transactions of securities in the secondary market . As such, the 1934 Act typically governs transactions which take place between parties which are not the original issuer , such as trades that retail investors execute through brokerage companies. In contrast, the Securities Act of 1933 prior to the Exchange Act established regulations for issuers and listings on the primary market . Disclosures To protect investors, Congress crafted a mandatory disclosure process designed to force companies to disclose information that investors would find pertinent to making investment decisions. In addition, the Exchange Act regulates the exchanges on which securities are sold. Regulation FD is the primary section of the Exchange Act which discusses disclosures. Reporting Requirements The required disclosures and forms of disclosure vary depending on the situation and the registrant. In general, under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act (codified in 15 U.S.C. § 78m ), companies with registered publicly held securities and companies of a certain size are called \"reporting companies,\" meaning that they must make periodic disclosures by filing annual reports (called a Form 10-K ) and quarterly reports (called a Form 10-Q ). Reporting companies must also promptly disclose certain important events (called a Form 8-K ). These periodic reports include or incorporate by reference types of information that would help investors decide whether a company's security is a good investment. Information in these reports includes information about the company's officers and directors, the company's line of business, audited financial statements , and the management discussion and analysis section. The Exchange Act also mandates disclosure at certain crucial points so that investors can make an informed decision before purchasing stock. Sections 14(a)-(c) (codified in 15 U.S.C. § 78n(a)-(c) ) govern disclosure during proxy contests, when various parties might solicit an investor's vote on a corporate action, or to vote for certain board members. All disclosure materials must be filed with the SEC. Tender Offers The Securities Exchange Act requires disclosure of important information by anyone seeking to acquire more than 5 percent of a company's securities by direct purchase or tender offer . Such an offer often is extended in an effort to gain control of the company. If a party makes a tender offer, the Williams Act governs (codified as 15 U.S.C. § 78m(d)-(e) ). A tender offeror must also file disclosure documents with the SEC that disclose its future plans relating to its holdings in the company. This information allows investors to decide whether to sell or not. Securities and Exchange Commission Section 4 of the Exchange Act established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , which is the federal agency responsible for enforcing securities laws. SEC Required Disclosures One important function of the SEC is to ensure that",

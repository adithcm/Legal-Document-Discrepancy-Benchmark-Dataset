The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "By removing the clause that i-on maintains reasonable steps to protect against data loss, the contract seeks to waive liability even if i-on is negligent in protecting customer data.

        "law_explanation": "Florida Statute 725.01 addresses contracts exculpating persons from liability for negligence. While not directly prohibiting all such clauses, Florida courts scrutinize them closely and generally disfavor clauses that attempt to relieve a party of liability for its own negligence, especially when not clearly and unambiguously expressed. The omission of the 'reasonable steps' provision implies a waiver of liability even if i-on is negligent.",

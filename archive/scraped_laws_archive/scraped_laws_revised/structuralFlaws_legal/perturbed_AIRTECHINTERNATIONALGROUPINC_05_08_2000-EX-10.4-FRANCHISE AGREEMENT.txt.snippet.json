        "original_text": "18.08. The Parties agree that any action brought by either Party against the other in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the State of Texas in the judicial district in which AIRSOPURE has its principal place of business and do hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
        "changed_text": "11.04. Should You, for any reason, fail to procure or maintain the insurance required by this Agreement, AIRSOPURE shall have the right and authority (without, however, any obligation to do so) immediately to procure such insurance and to charge same to You, which charges, together with a reasonable fee for AIRSOPURE's expenses in so acting, shall be payable by You immediately upon notice. AIRSOPURE is not a licensed insurance agent or agency. 18.08. The Parties agree that any action brought by either Party against the other in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the State of Texas in the judicial district in which AIRSOPURE has its principal place of business and do hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
        "explanation": "The jurisdiction and venue clause, which dictates where legal disputes must be resolved, is moved from the 'General Provisions' section to the 'Insurance' section. This is an unexpected location for such a clause, making it less likely to be noticed by a franchisee. This could lead to disputes over jurisdiction if the franchisee is not aware that they have agreed to litigate in Texas.",

        "law_explanation": "While parties can agree to a forum selection clause, 28 U.S. Code § 1404 allows a court to transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice. Hiding the forum selection clause in an unexpected section might influence a party not being aware of this agreement, which might influence the decision to request a change of venue.",

        "original_text": "18.07. This Agreement takes effect upon its acceptance and execution by AIRSOPURE in the State of Texas, and shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the State of Texas.",
        "changed_text": "3.01. In consideration of the Franchise rights and license granted herein, You agree to pay to AIRSOPURE the following fees: A. You shall pay to AIRSOPURE an initial franchise fee of $25,000.00 upon execution of this Agreement. You agree that the initial franchise fee represents payment for the initial grant of the Franchise rights and license granted herein, shall be fully earned upon execution of this Agreement, and the said fee will not be refunded under any circumstances unless otherwise specifically set forth herein. You must find a suitable Center site within 90 days of signing the Franchise Agreement, unless we mutually agree otherwise. If we cannot agree on a Center location, within 4 months, we may a) extend your search time, b) exchange your territory, or c) terminate your Franchise and refund up to 70% of your Franchise Fee, at our sole discretion. There are no refunds under any other circumstances. 18.07. This Agreement takes effect upon its acceptance and execution by AIRSOPURE in the State of Texas, and shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the State of Texas.",
        "explanation": "The choice of law clause is moved from the 'General Provisions' section to the 'Fees' section. This is an illogical placement that could make it difficult for the franchisee to quickly identify which state's laws govern the agreement. It could be argued that the law surrounding fees could be interpreted under Texas law, while other aspects of the contract might fall under the laws of another jurisdiction.",

        "law_explanation": "Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 187 states that the law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied if the particular issue is one which the parties could have explicitly resolved by a provision in their agreement directed to that issue. If it is not, the court will have to determine if other state law should prevail. Burying the clause makes it more difficult to show the intent of both parties at the time of signing. The success or failure of applying this section might be argued depending on the state the case is heard.",

        "explanation": "The attorney's fees clause is moved from the 'General Provisions' section to the 'Your Duties' section. This section discusses the franchisee's responsibilities, and it's not logical to expect a provision about attorney's fees to be located there. This misplacement can make it less apparent that the franchisee may be responsible for the franchisor's legal fees if the franchisor wins a dispute. Additionally, attorney fee clauses are supposed to be easily identified and agreed upon by the parties, so it could be harder to show the intent to be bound.",

        "law_explanation": "Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 38.001 allows for recovery of attorney's fees in certain contract cases. The location of the attorney fee clause is not in the section pertaining to general issues, but is included in a section relating to the franchisees duties. The party seeking to recover attorney's fees must prevail in court and recover damages. Placing the attorney fees clause in an illogical place might mean it goes unnoticed.",

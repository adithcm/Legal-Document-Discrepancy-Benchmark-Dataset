        "original_text": "The Company will bear those expenses of the proposed offering customarily borne by issuers, including, without limitation, regulatory filing fees, \"Blue Sky,\" and NASD filing and registration fees; the fees of the Company's accountants, attorneys, appraiser, transfer agent and registrar, printing, mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses associated with the Offering; the fees set forth in Section 2; and fees for \"Blue Sky\" legal work. If the Agent incurs expenses on behalf of the Company, the Company will reimburse the Agent for such expenses. The Agent shall be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including costs of travel, meals and lodging, photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers. The Agent shall also be reimbursed for its fees of underwriter's counsel (including counsel's out-of-pocket expenses) not to exceed $35,000. The selection of such counsel will be done by the Agent, after consultation with the Bank.",

        "explanation": "The $35,000 cap on reimbursement for underwriter's counsel fees is moved from its original position related to expenses to be included earlier in the paragraph. This could cause confusion about whether or not those fees are included in the other reimbursements, making the cap less prominent.",

        "law_url": "https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/33-8644.pdf",
        "law_explanation": "The law requires clear and concise disclosure of all expenses related to the offering. By obscuring the $35,000 cap in the general expenses clause, the Agent runs the risk of failing to disclose the expenses for the offering in a clear and prominent location, and therefore the cap might be deemed unenforceable. Moving the phrase causes the limit to be less clear and more difficult to find in the contract, as expense details must be prominently displayed.",

Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Bank have retained the Agent to consult with and to advise the Bank, the MHC and the Company, and to assist the Company, on a best efforts basis, in the distribution of the shares of Common Stock in the Offering. The services that the Agent will provide include, but are not limited to (i) training the employees of the Bank who will perform certain ministerial functions in the Subscription and Community Offering regarding the mechanics and regulatory requirements of the stock offering process, (ii) managing the Stock Information Center by assisting interested stock subscribers and by keeping records of all stock orders and (iii) preparing marketing materials. Section 16. Construction. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas.",
        "explanation": "Moves the construction/governing law provision into another section (which already covers retention of agents, compensation, sale and delivery of shares) to make it less prominent.

Standard contract law dictates that governing law provisions should be clear and unambiguous. By burying this provision, it increases the likelihood that a court might disregard the chosen law if it finds that the clause was not reasonably communicated or understood, especially because Alamogordo is in New Mexico, not Kansas.",

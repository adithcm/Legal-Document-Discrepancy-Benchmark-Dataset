        "original_text": "All subscription funds received by Capital Resources (and if by check shall be made payable to the Company) or by other NASD registered broker-dealers soliciting subscriptions (if any) shall be transmitted (either by U.S. Mail or similar type of transmittal) to the Company by noon of the following business day.",
        "changed_text": "All subscription funds received by Capital Resources (and if by check shall be made payable to the Company) or by other NASD registered broker-dealers soliciting subscriptions (if any) shall be transmitted (either by U.S. Mail or similar type of transmittal) to the Company within thirty business days.",
        "explanation": "The change extends the transmission deadline of subscription funds, potentially conflicting with regulations requiring prompt transfer of funds. The original text states \"by noon of the following business day,\" implying an obligation for immediate transfer. This modification extends the deadline to thirty business days, introducing a contradiction.",

        "law_explanation": "SEC Rule 15c2-4 requires brokers or dealers to promptly transmit customer funds received in connection with an offering. The modified text, which allows for a 30-day delay, clearly contradicts the requirement for prompt transmission under this rule.",

        "explanation": "By changing the jurisdiction, the parties may inadvertently violate state and federal laws that apply to the contract.

        "law_explanation": "Courts generally honor the choice of law provisions in contracts if the chosen state has a reasonable relationship to the parties or the transaction. Choosing a jurisdiction with no connection to the parties or transaction (a fictional location) may render the choice of law provision unenforceable, leading a court to apply the law of a jurisdiction with a closer connection, potentially contradicting the intent of the parties and applicable regulations.",

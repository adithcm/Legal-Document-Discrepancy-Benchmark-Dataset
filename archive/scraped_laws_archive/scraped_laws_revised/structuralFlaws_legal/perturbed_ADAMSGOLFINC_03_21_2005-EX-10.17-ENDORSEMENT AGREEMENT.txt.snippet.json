        "original_text": "33. ARBITRATION In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
        "changed_text": "24. SIGNIFICANCE OF HEADINGS Section headings contained herein are solely for the purpose of aiding in speedy location of subject matter and are not in any sense to be given weight in the construction of this Agreement. Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the construction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though such section headings had been omitted. 33. ARBITRATION In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel.

The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "The arbitration clause is moved to a section on the significance of headings, which undermines its prominence and discoverability. Placing a critical dispute resolution clause within a section discussing the document's structure obscures its legal importance. This violates standard legal practices that expect arbitration agreements to be clearly and conspicuously presented.",

        "law_explanation": "The FAA favors arbitration agreements, but generally requires that they are presented in a clear and conspicuous manner to be enforceable. Burying the arbitration clause in a section about headings could be argued as making it less conspicuous, thereby challenging its enforceability under the FAA.",

INDEMNITY CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement.",
        "changed_text": "32. CONFIDENTIALITY Both parties understand that the contents of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, all amounts paid or to be paid and any additional consideration, are extremely confidential, and that disclosure of same to any third party could be detrimental to the interests of one or both parties. Therefore, both parties agree not to disclose the terms of this Agreement, without the permission of the other party, to any third party other than to CONSULTANT'S business, legal and financial advisors, and with respect to all such advisors, CONSULTANT shall take all reasonable steps to ensure such confidentiality to ADAMS GOLF. Furthermore, CONSULTANT recognizes that during the course of performing his duties hereunder he may become aware of proprietary, confidential information concerning ADAMS GOLF, its PRODUCT, methods, processes, billing practices, financial condition, etc., or information ADAMS GOLF designates as confidential (collectively \"Confidential Information\"). CONSULTANT agrees that he will maintain in confidence and not disclose to any third party at any time any such Confidential Information and shall not use any such information to the detriment of ADAMS GOLF or for any purpose not contemplated by the Agreement. 14. INDEMNITY CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The Indemnity clause is moved to the end of the confidentiality clause, potentially obscuring its importance. Indemnity clauses are generally material, but moving it here implies the clause is related to confidentiality which reduces its clarity. The clause provides that consultant will protect ADAMS GOLF harmless for any liability, but if it is not obvious that they agreed to this, enforceability may be reduced.",

        "law_explanation": "Relocating the indemnity clause to the end of a confidentiality section could be argued as a violation of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, if it can be shown that the placement was intended to obscure the clause and prevent the consultant from fully understanding their obligations.",

        "scraped_snippet": "duty of good faith | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you duty of good faith The duty of good faith is the principle that directors and officers of a corporation who are making decisions in their capacities as corporate fiduciaries , must act with a conscious regard for their responsibilities in that role. A violation of the duty of good faith may include an intentional neglect of the usual duties of a director or officer, intentionally acting for a purpose other than the benefit of the corporation, or intentionally violating the law. Though there is no private shareholder right of action for a violation of the duty of good faith, its violation may also raise a claim under the duty of loyalty . In Heritage Surveyors & Eng'rs, Inc. v. Nat'l Penn Bank, 801 A.2d 1248 , the court held that “the duty of good faith has been defined as honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned”. Furthermore, the Uniform Commercial Code section 1-304 provides that “Every contract or duty within the Uniform Commercial Code imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.” [Last reviewed in September of 2022 by t"

        "changed_text": "11. PROMOTIONAL APPEARANCES A.During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall use best efforts to be available for such press interviews, radio or TV appearances arranged for CONSULTANT by ADAMS GOLF which are compatible with CONSULTANT'S own practice, play and personal time requirements. CONSULTANT will be required to be available after a tournament for selected interviews, either the Sunday afternoon or Monday morning following the tournament. In all such interviews and appearances, CONSULTANT will use his best efforts to make reference to the ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT and wear [*****] and display ADAMS GOLF'S brand name. B.During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall make himself available on not more than [*****] days for television and radio commercials, photo shoots, modeling and promotional appearances compatible with CONSULTANT'S own practice, play and personal time requirements.

APPLICABLE LAW This Agreement shall be governed and construed according to the laws of the State of Kansas.",
        "explanation": "The 'Applicable Law' clause is moved to the end of the section detailing promotional appearances, obscuring its legal significance by placing it with sections related to specific duties rather than in the 'Miscellaneous' or similar section.

        "law_explanation": "Although parties can choose the governing law, the choice should be clear and unambiguous. Embedding it within a specific section on promotional appearances reduces its prominence and could lead to disputes about whether the parties truly intended Kansas law to govern all aspects of the contract, particularly if there are aspects more closely tied to another jurisdiction (e.g., where the consultant resides or where ADAMS GOLF is headquartered).",

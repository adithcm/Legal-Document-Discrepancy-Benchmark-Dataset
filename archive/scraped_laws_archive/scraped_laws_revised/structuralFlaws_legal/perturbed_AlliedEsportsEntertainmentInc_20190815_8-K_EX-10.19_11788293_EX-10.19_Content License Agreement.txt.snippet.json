        "original_text": "This Agreement will for all purposes be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different state. Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably agrees that the federal and state courts in the Northern District of California shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any suit or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement, (ii) submits to the venue and jurisdiction of such courts, and (iii) irrevocably consents to personal jurisdiction by such courts.",
        "changed_text": "This Agreement will for all purposes be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different state. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that the federal and state courts in any district in the United States of America shall have jurisdiction over any suit or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement, (ii) submits to the venue and jurisdiction of such courts, and (iii) consents to personal jurisdiction by such courts.",
        "explanation": "By broadening the jurisdiction to 'any district in the United States of America' and removing the terms 'irrevocably' and 'sole and exclusive', the enforceability of the original jurisdiction clause is weakened. This change allows for potential disputes to be heard in jurisdictions less favorable or convenient for one of the parties, increasing legal costs and uncertainty.",

        "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/change_of_venue",
        "law_explanation": "While not directly contradicting the statute, the modified text creates ambiguity regarding the intended forum for disputes. 28 U.S. Code § 1404 allows for a change of venue based on convenience and the interest of justice, but a clear and unambiguous forum selection clause is generally upheld by courts. By making the forum selection non-exclusive and not irrevocable, it becomes easier for a party to argue for a change of venue under § 1404, undermining the original intent of the clause.",

        "original_text": "All notices and other communications given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sent by courier service, express mail, personal delivery or mail to the respective addresses of the parties set forth above (or at such other address as such party may designate by notice to the other party). A copy of any notice to WPT shall also be sent to WPT Enterprises, Inc., ATTN: Legal, 1920 Main Street, Suite 1150, Irvine, CA 92614. A copy of any notice to Zynga shall also be sent to Office of the General Counsel, Zynga Inc., 699 8th Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 with a copy to legalnotices@zynga.com. Notice shall be deemed given as follows: upon delivery if sent by courier service, express mail or personal delivery; and five (5) days after the date of mailing, postage prepaid, certified or registered mail if sent by mail.",
        "changed_text": "All notices and other communications given hereunder shall be in writing and may be sent by any means convenient to the sender, including but not limited to electronic mail. Notice shall be deemed given as follows: upon confirmation of sending by the sender.",
        "explanation": "This revision removes the specific requirements for notice delivery (courier, mail, specific addresses) and the detailed rules for when notice is deemed 'given.' This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes about whether proper notice was provided, particularly regarding proof of delivery and receipt. By changing it to 'confirmation of sending', there is no guarantee of it actually being received.",

        "law_url": "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1587.",
        "law_explanation": "California Civil Code § 1587 dictates how a proposal, or contract offer, can be revoked. While this modification doesn't directly address revocation, it weakens the established framework for notice. The California courts generally expect a reasonable method of notification. By omitting reasonable and specific methods of delivery, there is an increased risk that a delivered notice or revocation will not be considered valid, contradicting the intent of ensuring clear communication required in contract law.",

        "changed_text": "Each party agrees to consider carrying liability insurance.",
        "explanation": "This significantly weakens the obligation to carry liability insurance, changing it from a requirement to a mere consideration. This could leave one party financially vulnerable if the other party causes damages and lacks sufficient insurance coverage.",

        "law_explanation": "While not a statutory law, California recognizes the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. This covenant requires each party to act in a way that does not deprive the other party of the benefits of the agreement. By weakening the insurance requirement to a mere 'consideration,' a party could argue that the other party is not acting in good faith by exposing them to undue financial risk, thereby hindering the ability of the other party to benefit from the contract as intended.",

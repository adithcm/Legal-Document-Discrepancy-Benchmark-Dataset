        "original_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.",
        "changed_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) fifteen (15) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.",
        "explanation": "Reducing the agent's appointment period to 15 days after the offering may contradict regulations related to securities offerings, which often require a longer period for post-offering stabilization and compliance activities. This creates a tight timeline that may be inconsistent with industry standards and regulatory expectations.",

        "law_explanation": "SEA Rule 10b-21 pertains to short selling in connection with an offering.  The original text is more aligned with the time frame needed to meet regulatory requirements. Shortening the agent's appointment to 15 days would leave less time to take corrective measures in case of any problems, thereby increasing the risk of violating SEC regulations.",

        "explanation": "The original text establishes a 180-day lock-up period for the company's stock. Shortening this period to 30 days could conflict with standard underwriting practices and SEC Rule 144, which regulates the resale of restricted and controlled securities. A shorter lock-up period could lead to increased market volatility and potential insider trading concerns.",

        "law_explanation": "SEC Rule 144 requires a holding period before restricted securities can be resold.  While not directly a violation, shortening the lock-up period significantly increases the risk of non-compliance with Rule 144 if insiders or affiliates attempt to sell shares shortly after the offering, impacting market stability.",

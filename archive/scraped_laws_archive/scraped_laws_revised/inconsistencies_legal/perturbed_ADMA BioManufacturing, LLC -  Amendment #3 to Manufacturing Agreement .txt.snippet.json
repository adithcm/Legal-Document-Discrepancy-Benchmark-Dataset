        "changed_text": "All claims by Sanofi Pasteur for breach or default under this Agreement shall be brought within 6 months after the cause of action comes into existence or otherwise shall be waived.",
        "explanation": "The contract limits the time to bring a claim for breach of contract to 6 months, which may contradict Florida's statute of limitations for breach of contract.",

        "law_explanation": "Florida Statute § 95.11 typically allows five years for written contracts. Reducing the claim window to 6 months is a legal contradiction to the Florida statute.",

        "original_text": "Shipment of the Source Plasma to Sanofi Pasteur shall be made in compliance with the transportation conditions as provided in the Quality Agreement (as defined below), to be further amended by the Parties as contemplated in Section 9 below.",
        "changed_text": "Shipment of the Source Plasma to Sanofi Pasteur shall be made according to ADMA's standard operating procedures.",
        "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with transportation conditions specified in a Quality Agreement that is consistent with federal regulations. The modified version replaces this explicit requirement with vague reference to ADMA's 'standard operating procedures', which may not adhere to the stringent standards outlined in the 21 CFR Part 600 and related guidelines for biological product shipment.",

        "law_url": "https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-600",
        "law_explanation": "This change contradicts the regulation because it fails to ensure that the shipment of Source Plasma complies with the stringent conditions and standards required for biological products. It does not mandate that the source plasma must follow strict rules, which causes a failure to comply with legal and regulatory standards.",

        "changed_text": "The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete such amendment to the Quality Agreement within 180 days after the Amendment Effective Date.",
        "explanation": "This is a change from 60 days to 180 days. While not a direct contradiction, the new language \"180 days\" introduces uncertainty and potential non-compliance issues depending on what is in the amendment to the quality agreement. Delaying the amendment to the quality agreement increases the amount of time for potential issues to arise.",

        "law_explanation": "The delay can cause conflicts with the 21 CFR Part 606. Timeliness of implementing changes within the quality systems is a component of compliance with good manufacturing practices. A long delay introduces the possibility for issues such as lack of proper quality oversight.",

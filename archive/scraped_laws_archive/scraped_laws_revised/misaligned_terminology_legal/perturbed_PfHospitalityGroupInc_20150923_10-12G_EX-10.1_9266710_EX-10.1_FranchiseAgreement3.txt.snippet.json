        "original_text": "Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member's relationship with Franchisee. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",
        "changed_text": "Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any information deemed private or proprietary. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential, even if that information came to Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; and even if, at the time of the disclosure to Member, it had become a part of the public domain.",
        "explanation": "The term \"confidential information\" is now defined to include information that is already in the public domain or known to the member by lawful means prior to disclosure. This broadens the definition beyond what is legally defensible, particularly regarding trade secrets, which typically require an element of secrecy. It also seeks to nullify the legal exceptions that the member can demonstrate the information came from a separate, lawful source.",

        "law_url": "https://www.uniformlaws.org/acts/utsa",
        "law_explanation": "The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), adopted by most US states, defines a trade secret as information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use. The modified text contradicts this by defining 'Confidential Information' as something that can be considered confidential even if in public domain, which negates the element of secrecy required for something to be legally considered a trade secret.",

        "explanation": "The non-compete radius has been significantly increased from 3 miles to 50 miles. This could be deemed unreasonably restrictive under applicable state laws governing the enforceability of non-compete agreements.",

        "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits non-compete agreements, making them void unless they fall under specific exceptions. Even in states where non-competes are permitted, they must be reasonable in scope (both geographically and temporally) to be enforceable. A 50-mile radius is likely to be viewed as overly broad and unreasonable in many contexts, thus contravening the principles of reasonable restraint of trade. This contradicts the law by implementing an unreasonable, and therefore unlawful, non-compete agreement.",

        "original_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
        "changed_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor immeasurable injury, and Member agrees to pay all attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement. The Member is to pay triple the amount of usual attorney's fees.",
        "explanation": "The clause regarding attorney's fees is changed to specify that the member will pay triple the amount of usual attorney's fees, while removing the word reasonable. This could be seen as an unenforceable penalty, especially if it's disproportionate to the actual damages suffered. Furthermore, the deletion of the word 'reasonable' introduces ambiguity, inviting arguments against the fees.",

        "law_explanation": "The Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 208 states that a contract or clause may be unconscionable at the time the contract is made, and a court may refuse to enforce the contract, or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result. Tripling attorney's fees without a clear justification, and deleting the requirement that they be 'reasonable', moves the clause towards being an unenforceable penalty and potentially unconscionable, violating the established principles of contract law regarding fairness and reasonableness.",

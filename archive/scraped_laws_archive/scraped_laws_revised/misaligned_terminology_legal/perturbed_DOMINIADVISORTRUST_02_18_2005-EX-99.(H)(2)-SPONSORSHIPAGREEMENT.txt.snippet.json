        "explanation": "By stating the services are 'exclusive', the contract now restricts Domini from working with other parties, which could be argued as an unreasonable restraint of trade depending on the specifics of the market and Domini's market power. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of this clause.",

        "law_explanation": "Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade. While not a direct violation on its face, an exclusivity clause can be challenged if it unreasonably restrains trade by preventing Domini from providing services to competitors or new entrants in a market where such restrictions are deemed anticompetitive.",

The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",

A clause that purports to eliminate liability for gross negligence or recklessness may be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, particularly if there is a significant power imbalance between the parties.",

If a contract is unfair or oppressive to one party in a way that suggests abuses during its formation, a court may find it unconscionable and refuse to enforce it. There are two types of unconscionability in contracts, procedural and substantive. Procedural unconscionability is present when during the contract’s formation, at least one party does not have fair/meaningful choice, there’s misrepresentation, or unequal bargaining power among other factors. Substantive unconscionability is when the contract’s terms unfairly benefit/harm one side such as extremely unequal price compared to value exchanged. A contract is most likely to be found unconscionable if both unfair bargaining and unfair substantive terms are shown. An absence of meaningful choice by the disadvantaged party is often used to prove unfair bargaining. For example, in J ones v Star Credit , the Court refused to enforce a contract that charged three times the market value of an appliance to a"

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",

        "law_explanation": "Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 imposes a fiduciary duty on investment advisors (like Domini, acting as a sponsor) concerning compensation received from the investment company (the Trust). Shifting all expenses to the Trust without a clear benefit or justification could be considered a breach of this fiduciary duty, as it might represent excessive compensation or an unfair burden on the Trust and its shareholders. The key issue is whether the arrangement is fair and reasonable to the Trust and its investors.",

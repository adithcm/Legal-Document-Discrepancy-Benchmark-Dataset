        "explanation": "Removing clause (c), which covers claims of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights, significantly limits the scope of the indemnity. This could leave the Indemnitee exposed to substantial liabilities if they face an IP-related claim due to the Indemnitor's actions. This omission creates a legal contradiction with standard business practices and expectations regarding IP protection, potentially violating implied warranties or creating unfair business practices.",

This creates ambiguity and potential liability for the Indemnitee should a third-party IP claim arise related to the Sponsorship.",

Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California. Before any Party (the \"Complaining Party\") may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the \"Non Complaining Party\"), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Party's complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",

        "explanation": "Removing the requirement for pre-litigation dispute resolution (good faith attempt to resolve disputes privately and subsequent discussion) directly contradicts the California Rules of Court regarding alternative dispute resolution. Many California courts require or strongly encourage parties to participate in mediation or other forms of ADR before proceeding to trial. Omitting this clause bypasses this process, potentially leading to unnecessary litigation costs and delays. Furthermore, removing the arbitration clause removes the requirement to arbitrate the dispute. This is a drastic measure and will impact the costs of any legal disputes.",

This omission creates a potential contradiction with California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is part of every contract.

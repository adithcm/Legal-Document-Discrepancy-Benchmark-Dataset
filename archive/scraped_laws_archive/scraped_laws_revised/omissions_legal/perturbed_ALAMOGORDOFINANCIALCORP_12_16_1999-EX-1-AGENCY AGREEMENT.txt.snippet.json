        "changed_text": "The Company may furnish to its shareholders an annual report of the Company.",
        "explanation": "By removing the requirement to furnish shareholders with an annual report and by omitting the specific requirement that the report includes a consolidated balance sheet and other statements certified by independent public accountants introduces a legal contradiction with securities regulations that aim to protect shareholder rights through regular disclosures. This omission increases legal risk by reducing transparency and potentially concealing important financial information from shareholders.",

        "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
        "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each should endeavor to be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and general accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, and may rely on the other's information unless explicitly notified of inaccuracies.",
        "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'should endeavor to be responsible' and adding 'general accuracy' introduces ambiguity and reduces the legal obligation for timely and accurate filing. Allowing reliance on the other's information unless 'explicitly notified' shifts the burden of due diligence, weakening individual responsibility.",

        "law_explanation": "Rule 13d-1 requires accurate and timely filings by each member of a group. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'should endeavor' and shifting the burden of verifying accuracy, potentially leading to non-compliance with mandatory filing requirements.",

This filing is generally intended to align with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
        "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by changing 'agree' to 'intend', 'any future amendments thereto' to 'possibly future amendments', and replacing 'in accordance with' to 'generally intended to align with'. This weakens the commitment to joint filing and adherence to Rule 13d-1(k).",

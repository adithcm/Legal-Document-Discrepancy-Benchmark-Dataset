        "changed_text": "COMPANY shall endeavor to indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for damages, costs, and expenses related to third-party claims arising from COMPANY's actions.",
        "explanation": "The modified text weakens the indemnification clause by changing 'shall indemnify' to 'shall endeavor to indemnify,' making the obligation less definite. It also removes 'all' before 'damages, costs, and expenses' and removes 'reasonable attorney's fees and court costs' making the extent of indemnification unclear. Removing 'negligence or intentional misconduct' limits the scope of indemnity.",

        "law_explanation": "Texas law requires that indemnity agreements related to negligence or intentional misconduct be explicitly stated and clearly defined. By weakening the 'shall indemnify' obligation and removing detailed cost descriptions, the modified text creates ambiguity and could be interpreted as unenforceable under Texas law, particularly if COMPANY argues that its 'endeavor' was sufficient, even if full indemnification was not achieved. Also, by changing the definition of what is covered by the indemnity agreement, the contract could be interpreted to violate the anti-indemnity statute. Under the statute, a company generally cannot contract to indemnify a party if that party is negligent.",

        "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'Bravatek agrees to serve as a non-exclusive project sales lead finder' and 'will use its best efforts' with 'will generally attempt to promote' and 'some prospective clients.'

        "law_explanation": "Texas law regarding good faith in contracts implies an obligation to act honestly and reasonably. The original text's commitment to 'best efforts' aligns better with this standard. By reducing the obligation to 'generally attempt,' the revised text introduces ambiguity that could be interpreted as a lack of good faith, especially if Bravatek makes minimal or no effort to promote COMPANY's products. The term 'some' implies no set standard as to how many clients they promote the products to, which can result in a lack of a good faith.",

        "explanation": "This modification replaces the fixed term of five years with 'a reasonable period,' which is ambiguous and open to interpretation.

The original text with its specific five-year term and 'every reasonable precaution' aligns with this requirement. By using vague language like 'reasonable period' and 'should consider,' the modified text undermines the effort to maintain secrecy, potentially making it difficult to prove that reasonable measures were taken to protect confidential information, which is a necessary element to claim trade secret misappropriation under TUTSA.",

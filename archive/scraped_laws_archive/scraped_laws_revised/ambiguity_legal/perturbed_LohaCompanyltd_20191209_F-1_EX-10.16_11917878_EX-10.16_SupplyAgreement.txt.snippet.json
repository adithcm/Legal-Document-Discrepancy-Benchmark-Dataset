        "original_text": "The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order.",
        "changed_text": "The seller should endeavor to confirm within a reasonable timeframe after receipt of order. If the seller finds the order unacceptable or requires modifications, they may inform the entrusted party when convenient. If the seller doesn't respond promptly, acceptance is assumed at the entrusted party's discretion.",
        "explanation": "The modification introduces several ambiguities: 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation to confirm, 'reasonable timeframe' is subjective, 'may inform when convenient' makes notification optional, and 'acceptance is assumed at the entrusted party's discretion' allows for arbitrary enforcement.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 17 of the Contract Law of the PRC emphasizes the importance of a clear offer and acceptance in forming a contract. The original text stipulated a definite timeline for confirmation, which is a key part of the acceptance process. The modified text creates ambiguity, which can be interpreted as a deviation from the PRC Contract Law's requirement for a definite acceptance period, potentially leading to contractual disputes as the acceptance terms are not clearly defined and are subject to the entrusted party's discretion.",

        "original_text": "To be packed in new strong wooden case(s) /carton(s), suitable for long distance transportation and for the change of climate, well protected against rough handling, moisture, rain, corrosion, shocks, rust, and freezing. The seller shall be liable for any damage and loss of the commodity, expenses incurred on account of improper packing, and any damage attributable to inadequate or improper protective measures taken by the seller in regard to the packing.",
        "changed_text": "Packing should generally be appropriate for the goods, considering transportation conditions. The seller is potentially liable for damage or loss vaguely linked to packing issues, subject to mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the packing requirements and introduces ambiguity regarding liability. Replacing specific standards with 'generally appropriate' is vague. Furthermore, stating 'potentially liable' and 'vaguely linked' introduces uncertainty, and 'subject to mutual agreement' allows the buyer to avoid seller liability.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 16 mandates that import and export commodities must meet specific inspection standards to ensure quality and safety. The original clause had more definitive packing standards to maintain commodity integrity during transit, contributing to meeting import/export inspection standards. By weakening the packing requirements and making liability vague, the modified text could lead to goods being damaged during transport, failing import commodity inspection, and thus violates the intent of the law. The addition of 'subject to mutual agreement' introduces room for parties to potentially bypass regulatory requirements.",

        "changed_text": "The Sellers generally aim for the commodity hereof to substantially comply with the quality and specification stipulated in this Contract.",
        "explanation": "The modification weakens the guarantee of quality and specification compliance. The terms 'generally aim' and 'substantially comply' introduce subjectivity and do not guarantee full compliance. This creates ambiguity, potentially leading to disputes over whether the goods meet contractual requirements.",

        "law_explanation": "Article 13 requires that products possess the quality that they should have. The original clause provided a guarantee for commodities to comply with quality specifications detailed in the contract, thus demonstrating compliance with the article. The modification weakens this guarantee, implying the seller does not guarantee strict adherence to product quality standards which is required under the law. The ambiguous terms allow for potential reduction in product quality without violation of the contract.",

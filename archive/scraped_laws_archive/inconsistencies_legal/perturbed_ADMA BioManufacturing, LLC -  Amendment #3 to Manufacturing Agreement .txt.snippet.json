        "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with transportation conditions specified in a Quality Agreement that is consistent with federal regulations. The modified version replaces this explicit requirement with vague reference to ADMA's 'standard operating procedures', which may not adhere to the stringent standards outlined in the 21 CFR Part 600 and related guidelines for biological product shipment.",

        "explanation": "This is a change from 60 days to 180 days.

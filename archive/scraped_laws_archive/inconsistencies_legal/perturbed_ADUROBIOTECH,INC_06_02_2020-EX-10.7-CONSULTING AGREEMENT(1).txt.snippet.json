EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS [2700 - 3122.4] ( Division 3 enacted by Stats. 1937, Ch. 90. ) CHAPTER 2. Employer and Employee [2750 - 2930] ( Chapter 2 enacted by Stats. 1937, Ch. 90. ) ARTICLE 1. The Contract of Employment [2750 - 2755] ( Article 1 enacted by Stats. 1937, Ch. 90. ) 2751. (a) Whenever an employer enters into a contract of employment with an employee for services to be rendered within this state and the contemplated method of payment of the employee involves commissions, the contract shall be in writing and shall set forth the method by which the commissions shall be computed and paid. (b) The employer shall give a signed copy of the contract to every employee who is a party thereto and shall obtain a signed receipt for the contract from each employee. In the case of a contract that expires and where the parties nevertheless continue to work under the terms of the expired contract, the contract terms are presumed to remain in full force and effect until the contract is superseded or employment is terminated by either party. (c) As used in this section, “commissions” has the meaning set forth in Section 204.1. For purposes of this section only, “commission” does not include any of the following: (1) Short-term productivity bonuses such as are paid to retail clerks. (2) Temporary, variable incentive payments that increase, but do not decrease, payment under the written contract. (3) Bonus and profit-sharing plans, unless there has been an offer by the employer to pay a fixed percentage of sales or profits as compensation for work to be performed. (Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 826, Sec. 1. (AB 2675) Effective January 1, 2013.)",

        "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to 24 months may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under California Business and Professions Code Section 16600, particularly if the consultant's role does not involve access to critical trade secrets or confidential information.

(a) Except as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void. (b) (1) This section shall be read broadly, in accordance with Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP (2008) 44 Cal.4th 937, to void the application of any noncompete agreement in an employment context, or any noncompete clause in an employment contract, no matter how narrowly tailored, that does not satisfy an exception in this chapter. (2) This subdivision does not constitute a change in, but is declaratory of, existing law. (c) This section shall not be limited to contracts where the person being restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business is a party to the contract.

Depending on the exact setting, good faith may require an honest belief or purpose, faithful performance of duties , observance of fair dealing standards, or an absence of fraudulent intent . A fiduciary relationship creates a duty of good faith between the agent and the principal . The breach of this duty of good faith can lead to liability . Failure to act in good faith is known as bad faith and is generally considered to be a level of culpability greater than negligence .

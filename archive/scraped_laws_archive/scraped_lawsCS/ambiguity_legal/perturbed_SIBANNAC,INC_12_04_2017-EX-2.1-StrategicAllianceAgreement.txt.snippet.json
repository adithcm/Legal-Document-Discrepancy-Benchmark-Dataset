By making indemnification discretionary for any 'damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities arising from the actions of COMPANY,' irrespective of whether those actions constituted fraud, malice, or gross negligence, the modified agreement implies an agreement to potentially indemnify even when such exemplary damages would not be legally justified.

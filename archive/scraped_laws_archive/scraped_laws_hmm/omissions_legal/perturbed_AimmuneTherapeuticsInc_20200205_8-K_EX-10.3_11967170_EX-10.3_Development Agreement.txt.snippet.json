        "original_text": "Aimmune shall procure and maintain insurance, including clinical trials insurance and product liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations hereunder and which is consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated at all times during which the Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold by Aimmune pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that any such clinical trials insurance coverage shall, prior to the First Commercial Sale of a Product, in no event be less than [***] Dollars ($[***]) per loss occurrence, and product liability insurance coverage shall, after such First Commercial Sale, in no event be less than [***] Dollars ($[***]) per loss occurrence. It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of Aimmune's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written evidence of such insurance prior to commencement of this Agreement and upon expiration of any one coverage. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance which materially adversely affects the rights of Xencor hereunder.",
        "changed_text": "Aimmune shall procure and maintain insurance, including clinical trials insurance and product liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations hereunder and which is consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated at all times during which the Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold by Aimmune pursuant to this Agreement. It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of Aimmune's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11. Aimmune may provide Xencor with evidence of such insurance at its discretion. Aimmune may provide Xencor with written notice prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance.",
        "explanation": "The modified text removes the explicit requirements for minimum insurance coverage amounts, and the obligatory provision of written evidence of insurance to Xencor. Deleting the minimum requirements may lead to inadequate coverage, potentially violating legal requirements in countries like the US or EU. This change introduces legal risk by failing to ensure adequate financial protection against potential liabilities, a key consumer protection aspect.",

(\"FCPA\"), was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit the willful use of the mails or any means of instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to influence the foreign official in his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. Since 1977, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA have applied to all U.S. persons and certain foreign issuers of securities. With the enactment of certain amendments in 1998, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA now also apply to foreign firms and persons who cause, directly or through agents, an act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment to take place within the territory of the United States. The FCPA also requires companies whose securities are listed in the United States to meet its accounting provisions. See 15 U.S.C. § 78m. These accounting provisions, which were designed to operate in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, require corporations covered by the provisions to (a) make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and (b) devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. For particular FCPA compliance questions relating to specific conduct, you should seek the advice of counsel as well as consider using the Department of Justice's FCPA Opinion Procedure, found here. Foreign Extortion Prevention Act The Foreign Extortion Prevention Technical Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1352 (“FEPA”), was enacted in July 2024 and criminalizes the “demand side” of foreign bribery. FEPA complements the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making it a crime for any foreign official (as defined in FEPA, see 18 U.S.C. § 1352(a)(1)), or a person selected to be a foreign official, to corruptly demand, seek, receive, accept, or agree to receive or accept, directly or indirectly, payments from certain classes of persons and entities by making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in return for taking certain actions and in connection with obtaining or retaining business. FEPA generally mirrors the FCPA by defining those classes of persons and entities as (i) “issuers” and “domestic concerns,” as defined in 15 U.S.C. §§ 78c(a) and 78dd-2, respectively, and their officers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders thereof acting on their behalf; and (ii) “persons,” as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-3, if the foreign official or a person acting on behalf of the foreign official is in the territory of the United States. A violation of FEPA is punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment and a maximum fine of $250,000 or three"

        "original_text": "11.3.1 A Party believing that it is entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 (an \"Indemnified Party\") shall give prompt written notification to the other Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim by a Third Party (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 11.3.1 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice). Within [***] ([***]) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification.",

        "explanation": "The original clause offers 'prompt written notification' and also states an understanding that \"failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 11.3.1 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice.\" The changed clause removes these statements of 'prompt' and 'written' and also eliminates the provision that ensures the Indemnifying Party remains responsible to the level of material prejudice. Removing these key aspects significantly weakens the protection afforded to the indemnified party. This creates a legal risk by creating ambiguity around the notification process and the extent of the indemnifying party's obligation.",

        "law_explanation": "California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract, requiring each party to act reasonably and honestly in performing its obligations. By removing the 'prompt written notification' and limiting the indemnifying party's obligations only to cases of material prejudice, the modification introduces potential for the indemnifying party to avoid its responsibilities by claiming lack of adequate or timely notice, or arguing there is no material prejudice. This action can be argued as a failure to act in good faith and deal fairly with the indemnified party, creating a legal contradiction with California's established contract law.",

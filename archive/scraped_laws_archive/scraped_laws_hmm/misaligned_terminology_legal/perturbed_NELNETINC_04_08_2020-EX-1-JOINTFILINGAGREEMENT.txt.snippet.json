        "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
        "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby suggest that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D could be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned, at their discretion, pursuant to the general guidelines of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
        "explanation": "The original text affirms the filing in accordance with Rule 13d-1(k), which is mandatory under securities law. The modified text changes 'affirm' to 'suggest' and 'pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k)' to 'pursuant to the general guidelines,' which weakens the obligation and contradicts the mandatory nature of the SEC rule.",

        "changed_text": "Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way be construed to constitute Consultant as an agent, employee or representative of Company, but Consultant shall perform the Services as a worker.",
        "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' creates ambiguity. While the intent might be the same, some state labor laws define 'worker' broadly, potentially including individuals who might otherwise be misclassified as independent contractors. This could lead to challenges in determining the consultant's actual status and the company's obligations.",

        "law_explanation": "The IRS provides guidelines for determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Using the vague term 'worker' obscures the clear distinction that the company claims to establish, making it easier for a court or agency to reclassify the consultant as an employee based on the actual working relationship.",

        "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, with selective application of its conflict of law principles.",
        "explanation": "Modifying the clause to allow 'selective application' of conflict of law principles introduces significant uncertainty. Normally, choice-of-law clauses are interpreted with a consistent approach to conflict of laws. Saying the application is selective gives one party an advantage and makes the contract hard to interpret, and therefore, weakens its enforceability.",

        "law_explanation": "Texas law requires a consistent and predictable application of choice-of-law rules. Allowing 'selective application' undermines this predictability and introduces an element of arbitrariness, contradicting the principle of uniform application of law in contractual disputes.",

(e) The \"remaining economic life of the goods\" and \"reasonably predictable\" fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement must be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into. Amended by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 542, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 2003. Sec. 1.204. VALUE. Except as otherwise provided in Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 , a person gives value for rights if the person acquires them: (1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately available credit, whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in the event of difficulties in collection; (2) as security for, or in total or partial satisfaction of, a preexisting claim; (3) by accepting delivery under a preexisting contract for purchase; or (4) in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. Amended by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 542, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 2003. Sec. 1.205. REASONABLE TIME; SEASONABLENESS.

TERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF THE TITLE; PARTIES' POWER TO CHOOSE APPLICABLE LAW. (a) Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to another state or nation the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties. Failing such agreement this title applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state. (b) Where one of the following provisions of this title specifies the applicable law, that provision governs and a contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) so specified: Rights of creditors against sold goods.

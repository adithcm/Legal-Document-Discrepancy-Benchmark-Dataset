ARBITRATION 8.1 Any and all disputes, claims or differences arising out of or relating to this agreement or the alleged breach thereto shall be settled by mutual consultation between the parties in good faith as promptly as possible but failing such amicable settlement, shall be decided by Arbitration by the Arbitration Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce located in Switzerland. 8.2 The language to be used in the Arbitration proceedings shall be English. 8.3 The award/decision of the Arbitration Committee shall be final and binding on both the parties and enforceable in any jurisdiction.",
        "changed_text": "14.11 ARBITRATION 8.1 Any and all disputes, claims or differences arising out of or relating to this agreement or the alleged breach thereto shall be settled by mutual consultation between the parties in good faith as promptly as possible but failing such amicable settlement, shall be decided by Arbitration by the Arbitration Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce located in Switzerland. 8.2 The language to be used in the Arbitration proceedings shall be English. 8.3 The award/decision of the Arbitration Committee shall be final and binding on both the parties and enforceable in any jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "The arbitration clause has been moved from its own dedicated section, Section 8, to a subsection within 'Miscellaneous Provisions,' now 14.11. This relocation buries the critical dispute resolution mechanism within general terms, potentially reducing its visibility and enforceability.",

        "law_explanation": "While the FAA generally supports arbitration agreements, some jurisdictions require that arbitration clauses be conspicuously placed and easily identifiable within a contract. Burying the clause within 'Miscellaneous Provisions' may violate this principle, especially if it is deemed unconscionable or surprises a party unfamiliar with the contract's intricacies. Although the contract states that it is governed by the Laws of England, because one of the parties to the contract is located in Hong Kong, there may be a dispute as to which country's laws govern in the event of a breach of contract. To be safe, the US Law is listed here.",

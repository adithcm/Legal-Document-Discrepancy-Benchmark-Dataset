        "original_text": "(e) Defend Trade Secrets Act Notice: Nothing herein shall prevent Consultant from reporting possible violations of federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulation. Consultant does not need the prior authorization of Aduro to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify Aduro that it has made such reports or disclosures. In addition, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. §1833(b), Consultant shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and that is made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal.",
        "changed_text": "8. Representations. Consultant represents as follows: (a) Consultant is not subject to any other agreement that Consultant will violate by signing this Agreement; (b) Consultant has and shall continue to have the knowledge, experience, qualifications and required skill to perform, and shall perform, the Services in a professional manner; (c) Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with all Applicable Law; and (d) During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will not, directly or indirectly (whether for compensation or without compensation) engage in or provide consulting services, or enter into any agreement either written or oral, that would present a material conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or would preclude Consultant from complying with the terms and conditions hereof. If during the term of this Agreement any situation or circumstance arises that might reasonably be expected to present a conflict of interest, or if Consultant might be unable to render Services or otherwise participate in such work without risk of breaching an obligation of confidentiality to another party, Consultant will promptly advise the Company's General Counsel of the situation and Company and Consultant shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such conflicts(s). If requested by the Company's General Counsel, Consultant will recuse herself from providing Services for the duration of the conflict. Defend Trade Secrets Act Notice: Nothing herein shall prevent Consultant from reporting possible violations of federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulation.

        "explanation": "The Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) notice is moved from its own section to be buried within the 'Representations' section. This could obscure the consultant's rights under the DTSA, making it less likely that they are aware of their whistleblower protections. It is no longer highlighted or easily accessible, decreasing its prominence.",

        "law_explanation": "While the inclusion of the DTSA notice is technically present, burying it within a dense paragraph regarding 'Representations' significantly reduces its accessibility and clarity, potentially undermining the intent of the DTSA to ensure that individuals are aware of their whistleblower protections. Ideally, such notices should be prominently displayed.",

This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflict of law principles of California or any other jurisdiction. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every nature between them with respect to the subject matter hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not supersede or in modify in anyway any other written agreement between the parties. This Agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing signed by both of the parties hereto. The obligations of Consultant as set forth herein, other than Consultant's obligations to perform the Project, shall survive the termination of Consultant's engagement with Aduro. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain effective and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law. This Agreement shall not be assignable by Consultant. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement.",

From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates. In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief. Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.

        "explanation": "The governing law clause, which dictates that California law governs the contract, has been moved to the middle of the 'Nonsolicitation' section.

        "law_explanation": "While California Civil Code § 1646 allows parties to specify the governing law of a contract, placing this clause within the 'Nonsolicitation' section reduces its prominence and potential enforceability by obscuring it within unrelated content.

Consultant acknowledges that it is illegal to buy or sell Aduro's stock or the stock of companies working with Aduro, on the basis of \"material non-public information.\" It is also illegal to pass such information on to others who use it to buy or sell Aduro stock. Consultant is subject to and will comply with Aduro's Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy.",
        "changed_text": "2. Compensation and Expenses. Aduro shall pay Consultant for the Services at the rate of €500 per hour. On a monthly basis, Consultant shall submit to Aduro an invoice for the hours worked along with itemized documentation and receipts and other information for pre-approved travel and/or out-of- pocket expenses as Aduro reasonably requests at the time reimbursement is requested. Consultant will not incur any travel and/or other out-of-pocket expenses of more than €5,000 individually or €20,000 in the aggregate without the prior written consent of Aduro. Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within thirty days after receiving the invoice. Consultant's sole compensation for the Services shall be the amounts set forth above in this Section 2. Invoices shall be sent to the attention of: ap@aduro.com Attn: Accounts Payable Consultant may have access to, or learn, \"material non-public information\" about Aduro or companies working with Aduro during the course of performing Services under this Agreement.

Consultant is subject to and will comply with Aduro's Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy.",
        "explanation": "The insider trading policy disclosure is moved to the 'Compensation and Expenses' section. This is an unexpected location for such a disclosure and could reasonably lead the consultant to overlook it, as they would typically focus on compensation details within that section. The insider trading disclosure is meant to be easily accessible and understood.",

        "law_explanation": "While not explicitly mandated by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be in a specific section of an agreement, burying the warning regarding insider trading within the section concerning 'Compensation and Expenses' undermines its effectiveness. Best practices for compliance emphasize clear and conspicuous disclosure, which is not achieved by placing it in an unrelated section of the agreement.",

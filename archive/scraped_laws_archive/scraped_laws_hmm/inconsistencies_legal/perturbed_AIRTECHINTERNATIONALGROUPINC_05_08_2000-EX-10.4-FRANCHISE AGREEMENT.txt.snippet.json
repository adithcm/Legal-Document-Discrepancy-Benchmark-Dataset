If we cannot agree on a Center location, within 4 months, we may a) extend your search time, b) exchange your territory, or c) terminate your Franchise and refund up to 70% of your Franchise Fee, at our sole discretion.",

If we cannot agree on a Center location within this 30-day period, we will immediately terminate your Franchise with no refund of your Franchise Fee.",
        "explanation": "The modified text shortens the period to find a suitable site from 90 days to 30 days and eliminates the possibility of extending search time. Additionally, it removes the refund option, which may not comply with franchise laws in some states.",

Depending on the exact setting, good faith may require an honest belief or purpose, faithful performance of duties , observance of fair dealing standards, or an absence of fraudulent intent . A fiduciary relationship creates a duty of good faith between the agent and the principal . The breach of this duty of good faith can lead to liability . Failure to act in good faith is known as bad faith and is generally considered to be a level of culpability greater than negligence .

(2) The prohibitions in this paragraph shall not apply to allocations of shares of a new issue to any account described in Rule 5130 (c)(1) through (3) and (5) through (11), or to any other account in which the beneficial interests of executive officers and directors of the company and persons materially supported by such executive officers and directors in the aggregate do not exceed 25% of such account. (c) Policies Concerning Flipping (1) No member or person associated with a member may directly or indirectly recoup, or attempt to recoup, any portion of a commission or credit paid or awarded to an associated person for selling shares of a new issue that are subsequently flipped by a customer, unless the managing underwriter has assessed a penalty bid on the entire syndicate.

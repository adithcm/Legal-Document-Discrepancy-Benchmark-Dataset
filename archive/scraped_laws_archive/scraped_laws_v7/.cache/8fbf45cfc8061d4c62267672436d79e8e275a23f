                        statutory categories. <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b> defines the four categories of invention that
                        Congress deemed to be the appropriate subject matter of a patent: processes, machines,
                        manufactures and compositions of matter. The latter three categories define “things” or
                        “products” while the first category defines “actions” (i.e., inventions that consist of
                        a series of steps or acts to be performed). See <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302350">35 U.S.C. 100(b)</a></b> (“The term
                        ‘process’ means process, art, or method, and includes a new use of a known process,
                        machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.”). See <b><a href="s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397">MPEP §
                              2106.03</a></b> for detailed information on the four categories.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch2100_p_29a1b_1da63_27d">Second, the claimed invention also must qualify as
                        patent-eligible subject matter, i.e., the claim must not be directed to a judicial
                        exception unless the claim as a whole includes additional limitations amounting to
                        significantly more than the exception. The judicial exceptions (also called “judicially
                        recognized exceptions” or simply “exceptions”) are subject matter that the courts have
                        found to be outside of, or exceptions to, the four statutory categories of invention,
                        and are limited to abstract ideas, laws of nature and natural phenomena (including
                        products of nature). <i>Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,</i> 573
                        U.S. 208, 216, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1980 (2014) (citing <i>Ass'n for Molecular
                           Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,</i> 569 U.S. 576, 589, 106 USPQ2d 1972,
                        1979 (2013). See <b><a href="s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0">MPEP § 2106.04</a></b> for detailed information
                        on the judicial exceptions.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch2100_d24bfd_1715f_85">Because abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural
                        phenomenon "are the basic tools of scientific and technological work", the Supreme Court
                        has expressed concern that monopolizing these tools by granting patent rights may impede
                        innovation rather than promote it. See <i>Alice Corp.,</i> 573 U.S. at 216,
                        110 USPQ2d at 1980; <i>Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs.,
                           Inc.,</i> 566 U.S. 66, 71, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1965 (2012). However, the Court has
                        also emphasized that an invention is not considered to be ineligible for patenting
                        simply because it involves a judicial exception. <i>Alice Corp.,</i> 573
                        U.S. at 217, 110 USPQ2d at 1980-81 (citing <i>Diamond v. Diehr,</i> 450 U.S.
                        175, 187, 209 USPQ 1, 8 (1981)). See also <i>Thales Visionix Inc. v. United
                           States,</i> 850 F.3d. 1343, 1349, 121 USPQ2d 1898, 1902 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (“That
                        a mathematical equation is required to complete the claimed method and system does not
                        doom the claims to abstraction.”). Accordingly, the Court has said that integration of
                        an abstract idea, law of nature or natural phenomenon into a practical application may
                        be eligible for patent protection. See, <i>e.g., Alice,</i> 573 U.S. at 217,
                        110 USPQ2d at 1981 (explaining that “in applying the <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">§101</a></b> exception, we must distinguish
                        between patents that claim the ‘buildin[g] block[s]’ of human ingenuity and those that
                        integrate the building blocks into something more” (quoting <i>Mayo,</i> 566

                        criteria for eligibility. For example, in <i>Mentor Graphics v. EVE-USA,
                           Inc.,</i> 851 F.3d 1275, 112 USPQ2d 1120 (Fed. Cir. 2017), claim interpretation
                        was crucial to the court’s determination that claims to a “machine-readable medium” were
                        not to a statutory category. In <i>Mentor Graphics,</i> the court
                        interpreted the claims in light of the specification, which expressly defined the medium
                        as encompassing “any data storage device” including random-access memory and carrier
                        waves. Although random-access memory and magnetic tape are statutory media, carrier
                        waves are not because they are signals similar to the transitory, propagating signals

                        2007)). Accordingly, because the BRI of the claims covered both subject matter that
                        falls within a statutory category (the random-access memory), as well as subject matter
                        that does not (the carrier waves), the claims as a whole were not to a statutory
                        category and thus failed the first criterion for eligibility.

                        the test (whether the claims are directed to a judicial exception). For example, the
                        patentee in <i>Synopsys</i> argued that the claimed methods of logic circuit
                        design were intended to be used in conjunction with computer-based design tools, and
                        were thus not mental processes. <i>Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics

                        The court disagreed, because it interpreted the claims as encompassing nothing other
                        than pure mental steps (and thus falling within an abstract idea grouping) because the
                        claims did not include any limitations requiring computer implementation. In contrast,
                        the patentee in <i>Enfish</i> argued that its claimed self-referential table
                        for a computer database was an improvement in an existing technology and thus not
                        directed to an abstract idea. <i>Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> 822

                           which a claim falls, so long as it is clear that the claim falls into at least one
                           category. For example, because a microprocessor is generally understood to be a
                           manufacture, a product claim to the microprocessor or a system comprising the
                           microprocessor satisfies Step 1 regardless of whether the claim falls within any
                           other statutory category (such as a machine). It is also not necessary to identify a
                           “correct” category into which the claim falls, because although in many instances it
                           is clear within which category a claimed invention falls, a claim may satisfy the
                           requirements of more than one category. For example, a bicycle satisfies both the
                           machine and manufacture categories, because it is a tangible product that is concrete
                           and consists of parts such as a frame and wheels (thus satisfying the machine
                           category), and it is an article that was produced from raw materials such as aluminum
                           ore and liquid rubber by giving them a new form (thus satisfying the manufacture
                           category). Similarly, a genetically modified bacterium satisfies both the composition
                           of matter and manufacture categories, because it is a tangible product that is a
                           combination of two or more substances such as proteins, carbohydrates and other
                           chemicals (thus satisfying the composition of matter category), and it is an article
                           that was genetically modified by humans to have new properties such as the ability to
                           digest multiple types of hydrocarbons (thus satisfying the manufacture category).

                        <p id="ch2100_p_29a1b_2f6b2_2fc">In addition to the terms “laws of nature,” “natural
                           phenomena,” and “abstract ideas,” judicially recognized exceptions have been
                           described using various other terms, including “physical phenomena,” “products of
                           nature,” “scientific principles,” “systems that depend on human intelligence alone,”
                           “disembodied concepts,” “mental processes,” and “disembodied mathematical algorithms
                           and formulas.” It should be noted that there are no bright lines between the types of
                           exceptions, and that many of the concepts identified by the courts as exceptions can
                           fall under several exceptions. For example, mathematical formulas are considered to
                           be a judicial exception as they express a scientific truth, but have been labelled by
                           the courts as both abstract ideas and laws of nature. Likewise, “products of nature”
                           are considered to be an exception because they tie up the use of naturally occurring
                           things, but have been labelled as both laws of nature and natural phenomena. Thus, it
                           is sufficient for this analysis for the examiner to identify that the claimed concept
                           (the specific claim limitation(s) that the examiner believes may recite an exception)
                           aligns with at least one judicial exception.

                        <p id="ch2100_p_29a1b_2f72c_348">The Supreme Court has explained that the judicial
                           exceptions reflect the Court’s view that abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural
                           phenomena are “the basic tools of scientific and technological work”, and are thus
                           excluded from patentability because “monopolization of those tools through the grant
                           of a patent might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it.”

                           USPQ2d 1961, 1965 (2012)). The Supreme Court’s concern that drives this “exclusionary
                           principle” is pre-emption. <i>Alice Corp.,</i> 573 U.S. at 216, 110
                           USPQ2d at 1980. The Court has held that a claim may not preempt abstract ideas, laws
                           of nature, or natural phenomena, even if the judicial exception is narrow (e.g., a
                           particular mathematical formula such as the Arrhenius equation). See, <i>e.g.,
                              Mayo,</i> 566 U.S. at 79-80, 86-87, 101 USPQ2d at 1968-69, 1971 (claims
                           directed to “narrow laws that may have limited applications” held ineligible);

                           “wholly preempt the mathematical formula” held ineligible). This is because such a
                           patent would “in practical effect [] be a patent on the [abstract idea, law of nature
                           or natural phenomenon] itself.” <i>Benson,</i> 409 U.S. at 71- 72, 175
                           USPQ at 676. The concern over preemption was expressed as early as 1852. See
                           <i>Le Roy v. Tatham,</i> 55 U.S. (14 How.) 156, 175 (1852) (“A

                        <p id="ch2100_p_29a1b_2f842_241">While preemption is the concern underlying the
                           judicial exceptions, it is not a standalone test for determining eligibility.

                           in and resolved by the two-part framework from <i>Alice Corp. and

                           <i>Alice/Mayo</i> test, because while a preemptive claim may be
                           ineligible, the absence of complete preemption does not demonstrate that a claim is
                           eligible. <i>Diamond v. Diehr,</i> 450 U.S. 175, 191-92 n.14, 209 USPQ 1,

                           judicial exceptions need not be old or long-prevalent, and that even newly discovered
                           or novel judicial exceptions are still exceptions. For example, the mathematical
                           formula in <i>Flook,</i> the laws of nature in <i>Mayo,</i>
                           and the isolated DNA in <i>Myriad</i> were all novel or newly discovered,
                           but nonetheless were considered by the Supreme Court to be judicial exceptions
                           because they were “‘basic tools of scientific and technological work’ that lie beyond
                           the domain of patent protection.” <i>Myriad,</i> 569 U.S. 576, 589, 106

                           <i>Flook,</i> 437 U.S. at 591-92, 198 USPQ2d at 198 (“the novelty of

                           Court’s cited rationale for considering even “just discovered” judicial exceptions as
                           exceptions stems from the concern that “without this exception, there would be
                           considerable danger that the grant of patents would ‘tie up’ the use of such tools
                           and thereby ‘inhibit future innovation premised upon them.’”

                           idea, law of nature, or natural phenomenon? In Prong One examiners evaluate
                           whether the claim recites a judicial exception, i.e. whether a law of nature,
                           natural phenomenon, or abstract idea is <b id="">set forth</b> or
                           <b id="">described</b> in the claim. While the terms "set forth" and
                           "described" are thus both equated with "recite", their different language is
                           intended to indicate that there are two ways in which an exception can be recited

                           (F=ma) and therefore recites a law of nature exception. Because F=ma represents a

                           abstract idea. Because this claim recites a judicial exception, it requires

                           natural principles of mechanical advantage and the law of the lever. However, this
                           claim does not recite these natural principles and therefore is not directed to a
                           judicial exception (Step 2A: NO). Thus, the claim is eligible at Pathway B without

                           <p id="ch2100_p_29a1b_31ceb_1a6">The abstract idea exception has deep roots in the
                              Supreme Court’s jurisprudence. See <i>Bilski v. Kappos,</i> 561 U.S. 593,
                              601-602, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1006 (2010) (citing <i>Le Roy v. Tatham,</i> 55
                              U.S. (14 How.) 156, 174–175 (1853)). Despite this long history, the courts have
                              declined to define abstract ideas. However, it is clear from the body of judicial
                              precedent that software and business methods are not excluded categories of subject
                              matter. For example, the Supreme Court concluded that business methods are not
                              “categorically outside of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">§ 101's</a></b> scope,” stating that “a
                              business method is simply one kind of ‘method’ that is, at least in some
                              circumstances, eligible for patenting under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">§ 101</a></b>.”

                           <p id="ch2100_p_2ea7e_1c3b3_63">To facilitate examination, the Office has set forth an
                              approach to identifying abstract ideas that distills the relevant case law into
                              enumerated groupings of abstract ideas. The enumerated groupings are firmly rooted in
                              Supreme Court precedent as well as Federal Circuit decisions interpreting that
                              precedent, as is explained in <b><a href="s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321">MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)</a></b>. This approach
                              represents a shift from the former case-comparison approach that required examiners
                              to rely on individual judicial cases when determining whether a claim recites an
                              abstract idea. By grouping the abstract ideas, the examiners’ focus has been shifted
                              from relying on individual cases to generally applying the wide body of case law
                              spanning all technologies and claim types.

                              groupings are not mutually exclusive, i.e., some claims recite limitations that fall
                              within more than one grouping or sub-grouping. For example, a claim reciting
                              performing mathematical calculations using a formula that could be practically
                              performed in the human mind may be considered to fall within the mathematical
                              concepts grouping and the mental process grouping. Accordingly, examiners should
                              identify at least one abstract idea grouping, but preferably identify all groupings
                              to the extent possible, if a claim limitation(s) is determined to fall within
                              multiple groupings and proceed with the analysis in Step 2A Prong Two.

                                 described mathematical concepts as laws of nature, and at other times described
                                 these concepts as judicial exceptions without specifying a particular type of

                                 important points. First, not all methods of organizing human activity are
                                 abstract ideas (<i>e.g.,</i> “a defined set of steps for combining
                                 particular ingredients to create a drug formulation” is not a certain "method
                                 of organizing human activity”), <i>In re Marco Guldenaar Holding

                                 2018). Second, this grouping is limited to activity that falls within the
                                 enumerated sub-groupings of fundamental economic principles or practices,
                                 commercial or legal interactions, and managing personal behavior and
                                 relationships or interactions between people, and is not to be expanded beyond
                                 these enumerated sub-groupings except in rare circumstances as explained in

                                 encompass both activity of a single person (for example, a person following a
                                 set of instructions or a person signing a contract online) and activity that
                                 involves multiple people (such as a commercial interaction), and thus, certain
                                 activity between a person and a computer (for example a method of anonymous
                                 loan shopping that a person conducts using a mobile phone) may fall within the
                                 “certain methods of organizing human activity” grouping. It is noted that the
                                 number of people involved in the activity is not dispositive as to whether a
                                 claim limitation falls within this grouping. Instead, the determination should
                                 be based on whether the activity itself falls within one of the sub-groupings.

                                    at 1699. The patentee in <i>Mortgage Grader</i> claimed a
                                    computer-implemented system for enabling borrowers to anonymously shop
                                    for loan packages offered by a plurality of lenders, comprising a
                                    database that stores loan package data from the lenders, and a
                                    computer system providing an interface and a grading module. The
                                    interface prompts a borrower to enter personal information, which the
                                    grading module uses to calculate the borrower’s credit grading, and
                                    allows the borrower to identify and compare loan packages in the
                                    database using the credit grading. 811 F.3d. at 1318, 117 USPQ2d at
                                    1695. The Federal Circuit determined that these claims were directed
                                    to the concept of “anonymous loan shopping”, which was a concept that
                                    could be “performed by humans without a computer.” 811 F.3d. at 1324,

                                    using a computer processing system. The Federal Circuit determined
                                    that these claims were directed to mental processes of parsing and
                                    comparing data, because the steps were recited at a high level of
                                    generality and merely used computers as a tool to perform the

                              are markedly different. The courts have emphasized that to show a marked
                              difference, a characteristic must be changed as compared to nature, and cannot
                              be an inherent or innate characteristic of the naturally occurring counterpart

                              Thus, in order to be markedly different, the inventor must have caused the

                              having markedly different characteristics. This bacterium had a changed
                              functional characteristic, <i>i.e.,</i> it was able to degrade
                              at least two different hydrocarbons as compared to naturally occurring
                              <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria that can only degrade a single

                              <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacterium. The Supreme Court considered
                              these changed characteristics to be “markedly different characteristics from
                              any found in nature” due to the additional plasmids and resultant capacity

                              This claimed cDNA had the same functional characteristics (i.e., it encoded
                              the same protein) as the naturally occurring gene, but had a changed

                              from the DNA from which it was derived. As a result, [this] cDNA is not a

                              Court made clear that not all changes in characteristics will rise to the
                              level of a marked difference, <i>e.g.,</i> the incidental
                              changes resulting from isolation of a gene sequence are not enough to make
                              the isolated gene markedly different. <i>Myriad,</i> 569 U.S. at
                              580, 106 USPQ2d at 1974-75. The patentee in <i>Myriad</i> had
                              discovered the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the human genome,
                              and isolated them, <i>i.e.,</i> separated those specific genes
                              from the rest of the chromosome on which they exist in nature. As a result
                              of their isolation, the isolated genes had a different structural
                              characteristic than the natural genes, <i>i.e.</i>, the natural
                              genes had covalent bonds on their ends that connected them to the rest of
                              the chromosome, but the isolated genes lacked these bonds. However, the
                              claimed genes were otherwise structurally identical to the natural genes,
                              <i>e.g.,</i> they had the same genetic structure and
                              nucleotide sequence as the BRCA genes in nature. The Supreme Court concluded
                              that these isolated but otherwise unchanged genes were not eligible, because
                              they were not different enough from what exists in nature to avoid

                              be found in the human body”. The court disagreed, concluding that the
                              primers’ structural characteristics were not markedly different than the
                              corresponding strands of DNA in nature, because the primers and their
                              counterparts had the same genetic structure and nucleotide sequence. 774
                              F.3d at 760, 113 USPQ2d at 1243-44. The patentee also argued that the
                              primers had a different function than when they are part of the DNA strand
                              because when isolated as a primer, a primer can be used as a starting
                              material for a DNA polymerization process. The court disagreed, because this
                              ability to serve as a starting material is innate to DNA itself, and was not
                              created or altered by the patentee:

                                 sequences at issue here do not perform a significantly new function.
                                 Rather, the naturally occurring material is used to form the first step
                                 in a chain reaction--a function that is performed because the primer
                                 maintains the exact same nucleotide sequence as the relevant portion of
                                 the naturally occurring sequence. One of the primary functions of DNA’s
                                 structure in nature is that complementary nucleotide sequences bind to
                                 each other. It is this same function that is exploited here--the primer
                                 binds to its complementary nucleotide sequence. Thus, just as in nature,
                                 primers utilize the innate ability of DNA to bind to itself.

                              In sum, because the characteristics of the claimed primers were innate to
                              naturally occurring DNA, they lacked markedly different characteristics from
                              nature and were thus product of nature exceptions. A similar result was
                              reached in <i>Marden,</i> where the court held a claim to
                              ductile vanadium ineligible, because the “ductility or malleability of
                              vanadium is . . . one of its inherent characteristics and not a
                              characteristic given to it by virtue of a new combination with other

                              concluded that claimed clones of farm animals were products of nature,
                              because they lacked markedly different characteristics from the counterpart
                              farm animals found in nature. <i>In re Roslin Institute

                              Cir. 2014). The inventor created its clones (which included the famous
                              cloned sheep named Dolly) by transferring the genetic material of a donor
                              into an oocyte (egg cell), letting the oocyte develop into an embryo, and
                              then implanting the embryo into a surrogate animal where it developed into a
                              baby animal. The applicant argued that the clones, including Dolly, were
                              eligible because they were created via human ingenuity, and had phenotypic
                              differences such as shape, size and behavior compared to their donors. The
                              court was unpersuaded, explaining that the clones were exact genetic
                              replicas of the donors and thus did not possess markedly different
                              characteristics. 750 F.3d at 1337, 110 USPQ2d at 1671-72 (“Roslin’s chief
                              innovation was the preservation of the donor DNA such that the clone is an
                              exact copy of the mammal from which the somatic cell was taken. Such a copy
                              is not eligible for patent protection.”). The court noted that the alleged
                              phenotypic differences (<i>e.g.,</i> the fact that Dolly may
                              have been taller or heavier than her donor) could not make the clones
                              markedly different because these differences were not claimed. 750 F.3d at

                              in a growing body of decisions, the Federal Circuit has distinguished between claims
                              that are ‘‘directed to’’ a judicial exception (which require further analysis to
                              determine their eligibility) and those that are not (which are therefore patent
                              eligible), <i>e.g.,</i> claims that improve the functioning of a computer

                              judicial exception in Step 2A Prong One, examiners should evaluate whether the claim
                              as a whole integrates the recited judicial exception into a practical application of
                              the exception in Step 2A Prong Two. A claim that integrates a judicial exception into
                              a practical application will apply, rely on, or use the judicial exception in a
                              manner that imposes a meaningful limit on the judicial exception, such that the claim
                              is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the judicial exception. Whether

                              for all claims reciting a judicial exception, whether the exception is an abstract
                              idea, a law of nature, or a natural phenomenon (including products of nature).
                              Examiners evaluate integration into a practical application by: (1) identifying
                              whether there are any additional elements recited in the claim beyond the judicial
                              exception(s); and (2) evaluating those additional elements individually and in
                              combination to determine whether they integrate the exception into a practical
                              application, using one or more of the considerations introduced in subsection I

                              more than one consideration is relevant to analysis of an additional element. Not
                              all considerations will be relevant to every element, or every claim. Because the
                              evaluation in Prong Two is not a weighing test, it is not important how the
                              elements are characterized or how many considerations apply from the list. It is
                              important to evaluate the significance of the additional elements relative to the
                              invention, and to keep in mind the ultimate question of whether the exception is
                              integrated into a practical application. If the claim as a whole integrates the
                              judicial exception into a practical application based upon evaluation of these
                              considerations, the additional limitations impose a meaningful limit on the

                              judicial exception without amounting to significantly more, but another claim
                              dependent on the first may be eligible because it recites additional elements that
                              do amount to significantly more, or that integrate the exception into a practical

                              whole. That is, the limitations containing the judicial exception as well as the
                              additional elements in the claim besides the judicial exception need to be
                              evaluated together to determine whether the claim integrates the judicial
                              exception into a practical application. Because a judicial exception alone is not
                              eligible subject matter, if there are no additional claim elements besides the
                              judicial exception, or if the additional claim elements merely recite another
                              judicial exception, that is insufficient to integrate the judicial exception into
                              a practical application. However, the way in which the additional elements use or
                              interact with the exception may integrate it into a practical application.
                              Accordingly, the additional limitations should not be evaluated in a vacuum,
                              completely separate from the recited judicial exception. Instead, the analysis
                              should take into consideration all the claim limitations and how those limitations

                              invention was a method of virus scanning that scans an application program,
                              generates a security profile identifying any potentially suspicious code in the
                              program, and links the security profile to the application program. 879 F.3d at
                              1303-04, 125 USPQ2d at 1285-86. The Federal Circuit noted that the recited virus
                              screening was an abstract idea, and that merely performing virus screening on a
                              computer does not render the claim eligible. 879 F.3d at 1304, 125 USPQ2d at 1286.
                              The court then continued with its analysis under part one of the
                              <i>Alice/Mayo</i> test by reviewing the patent’s specification,
                              which described the claimed security profile as identifying both hostile and
                              potentially hostile operations. The court noted that the security profile thus
                              enables the invention to protect the user against both previously unknown viruses
                              and “obfuscated code,” as compared to traditional virus scanning, which only
                              recognized the presence of previously-identified viruses. The security profile
                              also enables more flexible virus filtering and greater user customization. 879
                              F.3d at 1304, 125 USPQ2d at 1286. The court identified these benefits as improving
                              computer functionality, and verified that the claims recite additional elements
                              (<i>e.g.,</i> specific steps of using the security profile in a
                              particular way) that reflect this improvement. Accordingly, the court held the
                              claims eligible as not being directed to the recited abstract idea. 879 F.3d at
                              1304-05, 125 USPQ2d at 1286-87. This analysis is equivalent to the Office’s
                              analysis of determining that the additional elements integrate the judicial
                              exception into a practical application at Step 2A Prong Two, and thus that the
                              claims were not directed to the judicial exception (Step 2A: NO).

                                 evaluated to determine if the disclosure provides sufficient details such that one
                                 of ordinary skill in the art would recognize the claimed invention as providing an
                                 improvement. The specification need not explicitly set forth the improvement, but
                                 it must describe the invention such that the improvement would be apparent to one
                                 of ordinary skill in the art. Conversely, if the specification explicitly sets
                                 forth an improvement but in a conclusory manner (<i>i.e.,</i> a bare
                                 assertion of an improvement without the detail necessary to be apparent to a
                                 person of ordinary skill in the art), the examiner should not determine the claim
                                 improves technology. Second, if the specification sets forth an improvement in
                                 technology, the claim must be evaluated to ensure that the claim itself reflects
                                 the disclosed improvement. That is, the claim includes the components or steps of
                                 the invention that provide the improvement described in the specification. The
                                 claim itself does not need to explicitly recite the improvement described in the
                                 specification (<i>e.g.,</i> “thereby increasing the bandwidth of the

                                 test (equivalent to Step 2A), they have also performed this evaluation in part two

                                 improvement analysis at Step 2A Prong Two differs in some respects from the
                                 improvements analysis at Step 2B. Specifically, the “improvements” analysis in
                                 Step 2A determines whether the claim pertains to an improvement to the functioning
                                 of a computer or to another technology without reference to what is
                                 well-understood, routine, conventional activity. That is, the claimed invention
                                 may integrate the judicial exception into a practical application by demonstrating
                                 that it improves the relevant existing technology although it may not be an
                                 improvement over well-understood, routine, conventional activity. It should be
                                 noted that while this consideration is often referred to in an abbreviated manner
                                 as the “improvements consideration,” the word “improvements” in the context of
                                 this consideration is limited to improvements to the functioning of a computer or
                                 any other technology/technical field, whether in Step 2A Prong Two or in Step

                                 associated with poor drug metabolism; and (2) administering iloperidone to the

                                    For example, consider a claim that recites a natural correlation (law of
                                    nature) between blood glucose levels over 250 mg/dl and the risk of
                                    developing ketoacidosis (a life-threatening medical condition). The claim
                                    also recites "treating a patient having a blood glucose level over 250 mg/dl
                                    with insulin”. Insulin acts to lower blood glucose levels, and administering
                                    insulin to a patient will reduce the patient’s blood glucose level, thereby
                                    lowering the risk that the patient will develop ketoacidosis. Thus, in the
                                    context of this claim, the administration step is significantly related to
                                    the recited correlation between high blood glucose levels and the risk of
                                    ketoacidosis. Because insulin is also a “particular” treatment, this
                                    administration step integrates the law of nature into a practical
                                    application. Alternatively, consider a claim that recites the same law of
                                    nature and also recites “treating a patient having a blood glucose level
                                    over 250 mg/dl with aspirin.” Aspirin is not known in the art as a treatment
                                    for ketoacidosis or diabetes, although some patients with diabetes may be on
                                    aspirin therapy for other medical reasons (<i>e.g.,</i> to
                                    control pain or inflammation, or to prevent blood clots). In the context of
                                    this claim and the recited correlation between high blood glucose levels and
                                    the risk of ketoacidosis, administration of aspirin has at best a nominal
                                    connection to the law of nature, because aspirin does not treat or prevent
                                    ketoacidosis. This step therefore does not apply or use the exception in any
                                    meaningful way. Thus, this step of administering aspirin does not integrate
                                    the law of nature into a practical application.

                              claimed email filtering system improved technology by shrinking the protection gap
                              and mooting the volume problem, but the court disagreed because the claims themselves
                              did not have any limitations that addressed these issues). That is, the claim must
                              include the components or steps of the invention that provide the improvement
                              described in the specification. However, the claim itself does not need to explicitly
                              recite the improvement described in the specification (<i>e.g.,</i>
                              “thereby increasing the bandwidth of the channel”). The full scope of the claim under
                              the BRI should be considered to determine if the claim reflects an improvement in
                              technology (<i>e.g.,</i> the improvement described in the specification).
                              In making this determination, it is critical that examiners look at the claim “as a
                              whole,” in other words, the claim should be evaluated “as an ordered combination,
                              without ignoring the requirements of the individual steps.” When performing this
                              evaluation, examiners should be “careful to avoid oversimplifying the claims” by
                              looking at them generally and failing to account for the specific requirements of the
                              claims. <i>McRO,</i> 837 F.3d at 1313, 120 USPQ2d at 1100.

                           <p id="ch2100_p_29a20_1d91e_43"> An important consideration in determining whether a
                              claim improves technology is the extent to which the claim covers a particular
                              solution to a problem or a particular way to achieve a desired outcome, as opposed to
                              merely claiming the idea of a solution or outcome. <i>McRO,</i> 837 F.3d
                              at 1314-15, 120 USPQ2d at 1102-03; <i>DDR Holdings,</i> 773 F.3d at 1259,
                              113 USPQ2d at 1107. In this respect, the improvement consideration overlaps with
                              other considerations, specifically the particular machine consideration (see
                              <b><a href="s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13ccf_18c">MPEP
                                    § 2106.05(b)</a></b>), and the mere instructions to apply an
                              exception consideration (see <b><a href="s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5">MPEP § 2106.05(f)</a></b>). Thus, evaluation
                              of those other considerations may assist examiners in making a determination of
                              whether a claim satisfies the improvement consideration.

                           <p id="ch2100_p_2ea81_1c22a_254">It is important to note, the judicial exception alone
                              cannot provide the improvement. The improvement can be provided by one or more
                              additional elements. See the discussion of <i>Diamond v. Diehr</i>, 450
                              U.S. 175, 187 and 191-92, 209 USPQ 1, 10 (1981)) in subsection II, below. In
                              addition, the improvement can be provided by the additional element(s) in combination
                              with the recited judicial exception. See <b><a href="s2106.html#ch2100_d2e7df_235a2_338">MPEP §

                              2018)). Thus, it is important for examiners to analyze the claim as a whole when
                              determining whether the claim provides an improvement to the functioning of computers
                              or an improvement to other technology or technical field.

                              “improvements” consideration by evaluating the specification and the claims to ensure
                              that a technical explanation of the asserted improvement is present in the
                              specification, and that the claim reflects the asserted improvement. Generally,
                              examiners are not expected to make a qualitative judgement on the merits of the
                              asserted improvement. If the examiner concludes the disclosed invention does not
                              improve technology, the burden shifts to applicant to provide persuasive arguments

                              <i>McRO,</i> the Federal Circuit held claimed methods of automatic
                              lip synchronization and facial expression animation using computer-implemented
                              rules to be patent eligible under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b>, because they
                              were not directed to an abstract idea. <i>McRO,</i> 837 F.3d at 1316,
                              120 USPQ2d at 1103. The basis for the <i>McRO</i> court's decision was
                              that the claims were directed to an improvement in computer animation and thus did
                              not recite a concept similar to previously identified abstract ideas.
                              <i>Id.</i> The court relied on the specification's explanation of
                              how the claimed rules enabled the automation of specific animation tasks that
                              previously could not be automated. 837 F.3d at 1313, 120 USPQ2d at 1101. The
                              <i>McRO</i> court indicated that it was the incorporation of the
                              particular claimed rules in computer animation that "improved [the] existing
                              technological process", unlike cases such as <i>Alice</i> where a
                              computer was merely used as a tool to perform an existing process. 837 F.3d at
                              1314, 120 USPQ2d at 1102. The <i>McRO</i> court also noted that the
                              claims at issue described a specific way (use of particular rules to set morph
                              weights and transitions through phonemes) to solve the problem of producing
                              accurate and realistic lip synchronization and facial expressions in animated
                              characters, rather than merely claiming the idea of a solution or outcome, and
                              thus were not directed to an abstract idea. 837 F.3d at 1313, 120 USPQ2d at 1101.

                              eligibility analysis regardless of the technology of the claimed invention. That
                              is, the consideration applies equally whether it is a computer-implemented
                              invention, an invention in the life sciences, or any other technology. See,
                              <i>e.g., Rapid Litigation Management v. CellzDirect, Inc.,</i> 827

                              claimed process for preserving hepatocytes could be eligible as an improvement to
                              technology because the claim achieved a new and improved way for preserving
                              hepatocyte cells for later use, even though the claim is based on the discovery of
                              something natural. Notably, the court did not distinguish between the types of
                              technology when determining the invention improved technology. However, it is
                              important to keep in mind that an improvement in the abstract idea itself
                              (<i>e.g.</i> a recited fundamental economic concept) is not an
                              improvement in technology. For example, in <i>Trading Technologies Int’l v.
                                 IBG,</i> 921 F.3d 1084, 1093-94, 2019 USPQ2d 138290 (Fed. Cir. 2019), the
                              court determined that the claimed user interface simply provided a trader with
                              more information to facilitate market trades, which improved the business process
                              of market trading but did not improve computers or technology.

                                    is not necessarily sufficient to make the use of the particular technique
                                    routine or conventional in the relevant field. The examiner in this
                                    situation would already know, based on the examiner's expertise in the
                                    field, that blood glucose is routinely and conventionally monitored by other
                                    techniques (<i>e.g.,</i> via placing a small droplet of blood on

                              use of the Arrhenius equation (an abstract idea or law of nature) in an automated
                              process for operating a rubber-molding press. 450 U.S. at 177-78, 209 USPQ at 4. The
                              Court evaluated additional elements such as the steps of installing rubber in a
                              press, closing the mold, constantly measuring the temperature in the mold, and
                              automatically opening the press at the proper time, and found them to be meaningful
                              because they sufficiently limited the use of the mathematical equation to the
                              practical application of molding rubber products. 450 U.S. at 184, 187, 209 USPQ at
                              7, 8. In contrast, the claims in <i>Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank
                                 International</i> did not meaningfully limit the abstract idea of mitigating
                              settlement risk. 573 U.S. 208, 110 USPQ2d 1976 (2014). In particular, the Court
                              concluded that the additional elements such as the data processing system and
                              communications controllers recited in the system claims did not meaningfully limit
                              the abstract idea because they merely linked the use of the abstract idea to a
                              particular technological environment (i.e., “implementation via computers”) or were
                              well-understood, routine, conventional activity recited at a high level of
                              generality. 573 U.S. at 225-26, 110 USPQ2d at 1984-85.

                              compared known information, the immunization step was meaningful because it
                              integrated the results of the analysis into a specific and tangible method that
                              resulted in the method “moving from abstract scientific principle to specific

                              meaningfully limit the judicial exception, it is particularly critical that examiners
                              consider the additional elements both individually and as a combination. When an
                              additional element is considered individually by an examiner, the additional element
                              may be enough to qualify as “significantly more” if it meaningfully limits the
                              judicial exception, and may also add a meaningful limitation by integrating the
                              judicial exception into a practical application. However, even in the situation where
                              the individually-viewed elements do not add significantly more or integrate the
                              exception, those additional elements when viewed in combination may render the claim
                              eligible. See <i>Diamond v. Diehr,</i> 450 U.S. 175, 188, 209 USPQ2d 1, 9
                              (1981) (“a new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all

                              important to note that, when appropriate, an examiner may explain on the record why
                              the additional elements meaningfully limit the judicial exception.

                              directed to a judicial exception patent-eligible, the additional element or
                              combination of elements must do “‘more than simply stat[e] the [judicial exception]

                              as mere instructions to apply an exception in several cases. For instance, in
                              <i>Mayo</i>, the Supreme Court concluded that a step of determining
                              thiopurine metabolite levels in patients’ blood did not amount to significantly more
                              than the recited laws of nature, because this additional element simply instructed
                              doctors to apply the laws by measuring the metabolites in any way the doctors (or
                              medical laboratories) chose to use. 566 U.S. at 79, 101 USPQ2d at 1968. In
                              <i>Alice Corp.,</i> the claim recited the concept of intermediated
                              settlement as performed by a generic computer. The Court found that the recitation of
                              the computer in the claim amounted to mere instructions to apply the abstract idea on
                              a generic computer. 573 U.S. at 225-26, 110 USPQ2d at 1984. The Supreme Court also
                              discussed this concept in an earlier case, <i>Gottschalk v. Benson,</i>
                              409 U.S. 63, 70, 175 USPQ 673, 676 (1972), where the claim recited a process for
                              converting binary-coded-decimal (BCD) numerals into pure binary numbers. The Court
                              found that the claimed process had no meaningful practical application except in
                              connection with a computer. <i>Benson,</i> 409 U.S. at 71-72, 175 USPQ at
                              676. The claim simply stated a judicial exception (<i>e.g.,</i> law of
                              nature or abstract idea) while effectively adding words that “apply it” in a
                              computer. <i>Id.</i></p>

                              exception does not mean that the claim must be narrow in order to be eligible. The
                              courts have identified some broad claims as eligible see, <i>e.g.,</i><i>McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,</i> 837 F.3d 1299, 120
                              USPQ2d 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2016); <i>Thales Visionix Inc. v. United
                                 States,</i> 850 F.3d. 1343, 121 USPQ2d 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2017), and some
                              narrow claims as ineligible see <i>e.g.,</i><i>Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC,</i> 772 F.3d 709, 112 USPQ2d 1750

                              consider each claim on its own merits, as well as evaluate all other relevant
                              considerations, before making a determination of whether an element (or combination
                              of elements) is more than mere instructions to apply an exception. For example,
                              because this consideration often overlaps with the improvement consideration (see

                              those other considerations may assist examiners in making a determination of whether
                              an element (or combination of elements) is more than mere instructions to apply an
                              exception. Note, however, that examiners should not evaluate the well-understood,
                              routine, conventional consideration in the Step 2A Prong Two analysis, because that
                              consideration is only evaluated in Step 2B.

                              2017), the steps in the claims described “the creation of a dynamic document based

                              USPQ2d at 1945-46. The claims were found to be directed to the abstract idea of
                              “collecting, displaying, and manipulating data.” 850 F.3d at 1340; 121 USPQ2d at
                              1946. In addition to the abstract idea, the claims also recited the additional

                              the dynamic document. 850 F.3d at 1342; 121 USPQ2d at 1947-48. Although the claims
                              purported to modify the underlying XML document in response to modifications made in
                              the dynamic document, nothing in the claims indicated what specific steps were
                              undertaken other than merely using the abstract idea in the context of XML documents.
                              The court thus held the claims ineligible, because the additional limitations
                              provided only a result-oriented solution and lacked details as to how the computer
                              performed the modifications, which was equivalent to the words “apply it”. 850 F.3d

                              an existing process. The court stated that the claims describe steps of recording,
                              administration and archiving of digital images, and found them to be directed to the
                              abstract idea of classifying and storing digital images in an organized manner. 823

                              performing these functions using a telephone unit and a server and noted that these
                              elements were being used in their ordinary capacity (<i>i.e.,</i> the

                              elements did not add significantly more to the abstract idea because they were simply
                              applying the abstract idea on a telephone network without any recitation of details

                              Two or recites significantly more in Step 2B is whether the additional elements add
                              more than insignificant extra-solution activity to the judicial exception. The term
                              “extra-solution activity” can be understood as activities incidental to the primary
                              process or product that are merely a nominal or tangential addition to the claim.
                              Extra-solution activity includes both pre-solution and post-solution activity. An
                              example of pre-solution activity is a step of gathering data for use in a claimed
                              process, <i>e.g.,</i> a step of obtaining information about credit card
                              transactions, which is recited as part of a claimed process of analyzing and
                              manipulating the gathered information by a series of steps in order to detect whether
                              the transactions were fraudulent. An example of post-solution activity is an element
                              that is not integrated into the claim as a whole, <i>e.g.,</i> a printer
                              that is used to output a report of fraudulent transactions, which is recited in a

                              the Supreme Court, a claim directed to a judicial exception cannot be made eligible
                              “simply by having the applicant acquiesce to limiting the reach of the patent for the

                              patentable”) (citing <i>Parker v. Flook,</i> 437 U.S. 584, 198 USPQ 193
                              (1978)). In <i>Flook,</i> the claim recited steps of calculating an
                              updated value for an alarm limit (a numerical limit on a process variable such as
                              temperature, pressure or flow rate) according to a mathematical formula “in a process

                              USPQ at 196. Processes for the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons were
                              used in the petrochemical and oil-refining fields. <i>Id.</i> Although
                              the applicant argued that limiting the use of the formula to the petrochemical and
                              oil-refining fields should make the claim eligible because this limitation ensured
                              that the claim did not preempt all uses of the formula, the Supreme Court disagreed.
                              437 U.S. at 588-90, 198 USPQ at 197-98. Instead, the additional element in

                              hydrocarbons was not sufficient to make the claim eligible, because it was merely an
                              incidental or token addition to the claim that did not alter or affect how the
                              process steps of calculating the alarm limit value were performed. Further, the
                              Supreme Court found that this limitation did not amount to an inventive concept. 437
                              U.S. at 588-90, 198 USPQ at 197-98. The Court reasoned that to hold otherwise would
                              “exalt[] form over substance”, because a competent claim drafter could attach a
                              similar type of limitation to almost any mathematical formula. 437 U.S. at 590, 198

                              measuring the temperature in the mold cavity, repetitively calculating a cure time by

                              1253, 120 USPQ2d 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2016). In <i>Affinity Labs,</i> the
                              claim recited a broadcast system in which a cellular telephone located outside the
                              range of a regional broadcaster (1) requests and receives network-based content from
                              the broadcaster via a streaming signal, (2) is configured to wirelessly download an
                              application for performing those functions, and (3) contains a display that allows
                              the user to select particular content. 838 F.3d at 1255-56, 120 USPQ2d at 1202. The
                              court identified the claimed concept of providing out-of-region access to regional
                              broadcast content as an abstract idea, and noted that the additional elements limited
                              the wireless delivery of regional broadcast content to cellular telephones (as
                              opposed to any and all electronic devices such as televisions, cable boxes,

                              additional elements did limit the use of the abstract idea, the court explained that
                              this type of limitation merely confines the use of the abstract idea to a particular
                              technological environment (cellular telephones) and thus fails to add an inventive

                              product, but clearly does not attempt to tie up the nature-based product, does not
                              require a markedly different characteristics analysis to identify a “product of

                              such as a claim that is directed to a cellphone with an electrical contact made of
                              gold or a plastic chair with wood trim, would not require analysis of the

                           relevant case law precedent or prior art) before reaching a conclusion with regard to
                           whether the claimed invention sets forth patent eligible subject matter. The evaluation

                           made on a claim-by-claim basis, because claims do not automatically rise or fall with
                           similar claims in an application. For example, even if an independent claim is
                           determined to be ineligible, the dependent claims may be eligible because they add
                           limitations that integrate the judicial exception into a practical application or amount
                           to significantly more than the judicial exception recited in the independent claim. And

                           may be ineligible because it adds a judicial exception without also adding limitations
                           that integrate the judicial exception or provide significantly more. Thus, each claim in

                                    elements, explain that the generically recited computer elements do not add a meaningful
                                    limitation to the abstract idea because they amount to simply implementing the abstract
                                    idea on a computer; or, if the claim is directed to a method of using a naturally
                                    occurring correlation, explain that data gathering steps required to use the correlation
                                    do not add a meaningful limitation to the method as they are insignificant
                                    extra-solution activity. Similarly, if the claim recites a "naturally occurring DNA
                                    segment" with an additional element of a test tube, explain that merely placing the
                                    product of nature into a generic container such as a test tube does not add a meaningful
                                    limitation as it is merely a nominal or token extra-solution component of the claim, and
                                    is nothing more than an attempt to generally link the product of nature to a particular
                                    technological environment.

                                    known as an "inventive concept") to the exception. For example, if the additional

                                 those in the relevant art, the examiner should reevaluate whether the

                                 activities to those who work in the relevant field. It is especially necessary
                                 for the examiner to fully reevaluate their position when such additional
                                 elements are not discussed in the specification as being known generic

                                 well-understood, routine, conventional activities. If the rejection is to be
                                 maintained, the examiner should consider whether evidence should be provided to
                                 further support the rejection and clarify the record for appeal. See

                                 application or provide significantly more than the judicial exception. Merely

                                 and does not preempt all applications of the exception, the examiner should
                                 reconsider Step 2A of the eligibility analysis, <i>e.g.,</i> to
                                 determine whether the claim is directed to an improvement to the functioning of
                                 a computer or to any other technology or technical field. If an examiner still
                                 determines that the claim is directed to a judicial exception, the examiner
                                 should then reconsider in Step 2B whether the additional elements in
                                 combination (as well as individually) amount to an inventive concept,
                                 <i>e.g.,</i> because they are more than the non-conventional and

                           <p id="ch2100_p_29a21_212e8_385">When the claims are deemed patent eligible, the
                              examiner may make clarifying remarks on the record. For example, if a claim is found
                              eligible because it improves upon existing technology, the examiner could reference
                              the portion of the specification that describes the claimed improvement and note the
                              claim elements that produce that improvement. The clarifying remarks may be made at
                              any point during prosecution as well as with a notice of allowance. 
                           </p>
                           <p id="ch2100_p_29a21_212f9_1f1">Clarifying remarks may be useful in explaining the
                              rationale for a rejection as well. For instance, explaining the broadest reasonable
                              interpretation (BRI) of a claim will assist applicant in understanding and responding
                              to a rejection. As an example, a rejection for failure to recite patent eligible
                              subject matter in a claim to a computer readable medium could include an explanation
                              that the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim covers a carrier wave, which
                              does not fall within one of the four categories of invention, and a suggestion to
                              overcome the rejection by submitting a narrowing amendment to cover the statutory
                              embodiments.

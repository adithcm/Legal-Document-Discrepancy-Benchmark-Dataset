<STRONG>SECTION 335-349.4
</STRONG><BR>
<P><PRE>
335.  The periods prescribed for the commencement of actions other
than for the recovery of real property, are as follows:
335.1.  Within two years:  An action for  assault, battery, or
injury to, or for the death of, an individual caused by the wrongful
act or neglect of another.
336.  Within five years:
   (a) An action for mesne profits of real property.
   (b) An action for violation of a restriction, as defined in
Section 784 of the Civil Code.  The period prescribed in this
subdivision runs from the time the person seeking to enforce the
restriction discovered or, through the exercise of reasonable
diligence, should have discovered the violation.  A failure to
commence an action for violation of a restriction within the period
prescribed in this subdivision does not waive the right to commence
an action for any other violation of the restriction and does not, in
itself, create an implication that the restriction is abandoned,
obsolete, or otherwise unenforceable.  This subdivision shall not bar
commencement of an action for violation of a restriction before
January 1, 2001, and until January 1, 2001, any other applicable
statutory or common law limitation shall continue to apply to that
action.
336a.  Within six years.  1. An action upon any bonds, notes or
debentures issued by any corporation or pursuant to permit of the
Commissioner of Corporations, or upon any coupons issued with such
bonds, notes or debentures, if such bonds, notes or debentures shall
have been issued to or held by the public.
   2. An action upon any mortgage, trust deed or other agreement
pursuant to which such bonds, notes or debentures were issued.
Nothing in this section shall apply to bonds or other evidences of
indebtedness of a public district or corporation.
337.  Within four years:  1. An action upon any contract, obligation
or liability founded upon an instrument in writing, except as
provided in Section 336a of this code; provided, that the time within
which any action for a money judgment for the balance due upon an
obligation for the payment of which a deed of trust or mortgage with
power of sale upon real property or any interest therein was given as
security, following the exercise of the power of sale in such deed
of trust or mortgage, may be brought shall not extend beyond three
months after the time of sale under such deed of trust or mortgage.
   2. An action to recover (1) upon a book account whether consisting
of one or more entries; (2) upon an account stated based upon an
account in writing, but the acknowledgment of the account stated need
not be in writing; (3) a balance due upon a mutual, open and current
account, the items of which are in writing; provided, however, that
where an account stated is based upon an account of one item, the
time shall begin to run from the date of said item, and where an
account stated is based upon an account of more than one item, the
time shall begin to run from the date of the last item.
   3. An action based upon the rescission of a contract in writing.
The time begins to run from the date upon which the facts that
entitle the aggrieved party to rescind occurred.  Where the ground
for rescission is fraud or mistake, the time does not begin to run
until the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting
the fraud or mistake.  Where the ground for rescission is
misrepresentation under Section 359 of the Insurance Code, the time
does not begin to run until the representation becomes false.
337a.  The term "book account" means a detailed statement which
constitutes the principal record of one or more transactions between
a debtor and a creditor arising out of a contract or some fiduciary
relation, and shows the debits and credits in connection therewith,
and against whom and in favor of whom entries are made, is entered in
the regular course of business as conducted by such creditor or
fiduciary, and is kept in a reasonably permanent form and manner and
is (1) in a bound book, or (2) on a sheet or sheets fastened in a
book or to backing but detachable therefrom, or (3) on a card or
cards of a permanent character, or is kept in any other reasonably
permanent form and manner.
337.1.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no action
shall be brought to recover damages from any person performing or
furnishing the design, specifications, surveying, planning,
supervision or observation of construction or construction of an
improvement to real property more than four years after the

   (1) Any patent deficiency in the design, specifications,

construction of an improvement to, or survey of, real property;
   (2) Injury to property, real or personal, arising out of any such

   (3) Injury to the person or for wrongful death arising out of any
such patent deficiency.
   (b) If, by reason of such patent deficiency, an injury to property
or the person or an injury causing wrongful death occurs during the

within one year after the date on which such injury occurred,
irrespective of the date of death, but in no event may such an action
be brought more than five years after the substantial completion of
construction of such improvement.

period prescribed by the laws of this state for the bringing of any
action.

planning, supervision, or observation of construction or
construction of an improvement to, or survey of, real property.
   (2) Injury to property, real or personal, arising out of any such
latent deficiency.

indemnity brought against a person arising out of that person's
performance or furnishing of services or materials referred to in
this section, except that a cross-complaint for indemnity may be
filed pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 428.10 in an action
which has been brought within the time period set forth in
subdivision (a) of this section.
   (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as extending the
period prescribed by the laws of this state for bringing any action.
   (e) The limitation prescribed by this section shall not be
asserted by way of defense by any person in actual possession or the
control, as owner, tenant or otherwise, of such an improvement, at

shall be brought under Section 1951.2 of the Civil Code more than
four years after the breach of the lease and abandonment of the
property, or more than four years after the termination of the right
of the lessee to possession of the property, whichever is the earlier

340.1.  (a) In an action for recovery of damages suffered as a
result of childhood sexual abuse, the time for commencement of the
action shall be within eight years of the date the plaintiff attains
the age of majority or within three years of the date the plaintiff
discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological
injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by
the sexual abuse, whichever period expires later, for any of the
following actions:
   (1) An action against any person for committing an act of
childhood sexual abuse.
   (2) An action for liability against any person or entity who owed
a duty of care to the plaintiff, where a wrongful or negligent act by
that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual
abuse which resulted in the injury to the plaintiff.
   (3) An action for liability against any person or entity where an
intentional act by that person or entity was a legal cause of the
childhood sexual abuse which resulted in the injury to the plaintiff.
   (b) (1) No action described in paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision
(a) may be commenced on or after the plaintiff's 26th birthday.
   (2) This subdivision does not apply if the person or entity knew
or had reason to know, or was otherwise on notice, of any  unlawful
sexual conduct by an employee, volunteer, representative, or agent,
and failed to take reasonable steps, and to implement reasonable
safeguards, to avoid acts of unlawful sexual conduct in the future by
that person, including, but not limited to, preventing or avoiding
placement of that person in a function or environment in which
contact with children is an inherent part of that function or
environment.  For purposes of this subdivision, providing or
requiring counseling is not sufficient, in and of itself, to
constitute a reasonable step or reasonable safeguard.
   (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any claim for
damages described in paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (a) that is
permitted to be filed pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b)
that would otherwise be barred as of January 1, 2003, solely because
the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired, is revived,
and, in that case, a cause of action may be commenced within one
year of January 1, 2003.  Nothing in this subdivision shall be
construed to alter the applicable statute of limitations period of an
action that is not time barred as of January 1, 2003.
   (d) Subdivision (c) does not apply to either of the following:
   (1) Any claim that has been litigated to finality on the merits in
any court of competent jurisdiction prior to January 1, 2003.
Termination of a prior action on the basis of the statute of
limitations does not constitute a claim that has been litigated to
finality on the merits.
   (2) Any written, compromised settlement agreement which has been
entered into between a plaintiff and a defendant where the plaintiff
was represented by an attorney who was admitted to practice law in
this state at the time of the settlement, and  the plaintiff signed
the agreement.
   (e) "Childhood sexual abuse" as used in this section includes any
act committed against the plaintiff that occurred when the plaintiff
was under the age of 18 years and that would have been proscribed by
Section 266j of the Penal Code; Section 285 of the Penal Code;
paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (b), or of subdivision (c), of
Section 286 of the Penal Code; subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 288
of the Penal Code; paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (b), or of
subdivision (c), of Section 288a of the Penal Code; subdivision (h),
(i), or (j) of Section 289 of the Penal Code; Section 647.6 of the
Penal Code; or any prior laws of this state of similar effect at the
time the act was committed.  Nothing in this subdivision limits the
availability of causes of action permitted under subdivision (a),
including causes of action against persons or entities other than the
alleged perpetrator of the abuse.
   (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the
otherwise applicable burden of proof, as defined in Section 115 of
the Evidence Code, that a plaintiff has in a civil action subject to
this section.
   (g) Every plaintiff 26 years of age or older at the time the
action is filed shall file certificates of merit as specified in
subdivision (h).
   (h) Certificates of merit shall be executed by the attorney for
the plaintiff and by a licensed mental health practitioner selected
by the plaintiff declaring, respectively, as follows, setting forth
the facts which support the declaration:
   (1) That the attorney has reviewed the facts of the case, that the
attorney has consulted with at least one mental health practitioner
who is licensed to practice and practices in this state and who the
attorney reasonably believes is knowledgeable of the relevant facts
and issues involved in the particular action, and that the attorney
has concluded on the basis of that review and consultation that there
is reasonable and meritorious cause for the filing of the action.
The person consulted may not be a party to the litigation.
   (2) That the mental health practitioner consulted is licensed to
practice and practices in this state and is not a party to the
action, that the practitioner is not treating and has not treated the
plaintiff, and that the practitioner has interviewed the plaintiff
and is knowledgeable of the relevant facts and issues involved in the
particular action, and has concluded, on the basis of his or her
knowledge of the facts and issues, that in his or her professional
opinion there is a reasonable basis to believe that the plaintiff had
been subject to childhood sexual abuse.
   (3) That the attorney was unable to obtain the consultation
required by paragraph (1) because a statute of limitations would
impair the action and that the certificates required by paragraphs
(1) and (2) could not be obtained before the impairment of the
action.  If a certificate is executed pursuant to this paragraph, the
certificates required by paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be filed
within 60 days after filing the complaint.
   (i) Where certificates are required pursuant to subdivision (g),
the attorney for the plaintiff shall execute a separate certificate
of merit for each defendant named in the complaint.
   (j) In any action subject to subdivision (g), no defendant may be
served,  and the duty to serve a defendant with process does not
attach, until the court has reviewed the certificates of merit filed
pursuant to subdivision (h) with respect to that defendant, and has
found, in camera, based solely on those certificates of merit, that
there is reasonable and meritorious cause for the filing of the
action against that defendant.  At that time, the duty to serve that
defendant with process shall attach.
   (k) A violation of this section may constitute unprofessional
conduct and may be the grounds for discipline against the attorney.
   (l) The failure to file certificates in accordance with this
section shall be grounds for a demurrer pursuant to Section 430.10 or
a motion to strike pursuant to Section 435.
   (m) In any action subject to subdivision  (g), no defendant may be
named except by "Doe" designation in any pleadings or papers filed
in the action until there has been a showing of corroborative fact as
to the charging allegations against that defendant.
   (n) At any time after the action is filed, the plaintiff may apply
to the court for permission to amend the complaint to substitute the
name of the defendant or defendants for the fictitious designation,
as follows:
   (1) The application shall be accompanied by a certificate of
corroborative fact executed by the attorney for the plaintiff.  The
certificate shall declare that the attorney has discovered one or
more facts corroborative of one or more of the charging allegations
against a defendant or defendants, and shall set forth in clear and
concise terms the nature and substance of the corroborative fact.  If
the corroborative fact is evidenced by the statement of a witness or
the contents of a document, the certificate shall declare that the
attorney has personal knowledge of the statement of the witness or of
the contents of the document, and the identity and location of the
witness or document shall be included in the certificate.  For
purposes of this section, a fact is corroborative of an allegation if
it confirms or supports the allegation.  The opinion of any mental
health practitioner concerning the plaintiff shall not constitute a
corroborative fact for purposes of this section.
   (2) Where the application to name a defendant is made prior to
that defendant's appearance in the action, neither the application
nor the certificate of corroborative fact by the attorney shall be
served on the defendant or defendants, nor on any other party or
their counsel of record.
   (3) Where the application to name a defendant is made after that
defendant's appearance in the action, the application shall be served
on all parties and proof of service provided to the court, but the
certificate of corroborative fact by the attorney shall not be served
on any party or their counsel of record.
   (o) The court shall review the application and the certificate of
corroborative fact in camera and, based solely on the certificate and
any reasonable inferences to be drawn  from the certificate, shall,
if one or more facts corroborative of one or more of the charging
allegations against a defendant has been shown, order that the
complaint may be amended to substitute the name of the defendant or
defendants.
   (p) The court shall keep under seal and confidential from the
public and all parties to the litigation, other than the plaintiff,
any and all certificates of corroborative fact filed pursuant to
subdivision (n).
   (q) Upon the favorable conclusion of the litigation with respect
to any defendant for whom a certificate of merit was filed or for
whom a certificate of merit should have been filed pursuant to this
section, the court may, upon the motion of a party or upon the court'
s own motion, verify compliance with this section by requiring the
attorney for the plaintiff who was required by subdivision (h) to
execute the certificate to reveal the name, address, and telephone
number of the person or persons consulted with pursuant to
subdivision (h) that were relied upon by the attorney in preparation
of the certificate of merit.  The name, address, and telephone number
shall be disclosed to the trial judge in camera and in the absence
of the moving party.  If the court finds there has been a failure to
comply with this section, the court may order a party, a party's
attorney, or both, to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney'
s fees, incurred by the defendant for whom a certificate of merit
should have been filed.
   (r) The amendments to this section enacted at the 1990 portion of
the 1989-90 Regular Session shall apply to any action commenced on or

any action or causes of action which would have been barred by the
laws in effect prior to January 1, 1999.  Nothing in this subdivision

hazardous material or toxic substance" does not include an action

proceedings.  Unless an action is commenced within said period all
said acts or proceedings shall be held valid and in every respect
legal and incontestable.
   This section shall not amend or repeal any existing statute
prescribing a shorter period of limitation than that specified
herein.
349.2.  Where any acts or proceedings are taken under color of law
by or on behalf of any city, county, city and county, special
district, public corporation or other public entity for the
authorization, sale or issuance of bonds:
   (1) The validity of any such acts or proceedings for the
authorization of bonds shall not be contested in any action unless
such action shall have been brought within six months from the date
of election authorizing said bonds, in cases where said bonds are
required by law to be authorized at an election, or within six months
from the date of adoption of a resolution or ordinance authorizing
such bonds, in cases where bonds are not required by law to be
authorized at an election;
   (2) The validity of any such acts or proceedings for the sale of
bonds (including all acts or proceedings taken prior thereto and
providing for the issuance of such bonds) shall not be contested in
any action unless such action shall have been brought within six
months from the date of sale of said bonds;
   (3) The validity of any such acts or proceedings for the issuance
and delivery of, or payment for, bonds shall not be contested in any
action unless such action shall have been brought within six months
from the date of issuance and delivery of, or payment for, said
bonds.
   Unless an action is commenced within the applicable time
hereinabove specified, said acts or proceedings for the
authorization, sale or issuance of bonds shall be held valid and in
every respect legal and incontestable.
   This section shall not amend or repeal any existing statute
prescribing a shorter period of limitation than that specified
herein.
   As used in this section, the term "bonds" means all instruments
evidencing indebtedness incurred or to be incurred for any public
purpose, all instruments evidencing the borrowing of money in
anticipation of taxes, revenues or other income of a public body, all
instruments payable from revenues or special funds, and all
instruments funding or refunding any thereof or any indebtedness, but
shall not include any special assessment bonds, special assessment
refunding bonds, or bonds or other instruments issued to represent
special assessments which are, directly or indirectly, secured by or
payable from specific assessments levied against lands benefited,
including bonds or other instruments issued under or pursuant to any
statute, charter or ordinance providing for the improvement of
streets, the opening and widening of streets, the provision for
off-street parking, or the refunding of any of the same.
349.4.  All acts and proceedings heretofore or hereafter taken under
color of law for the formation, organization or incorporation of, or
for any change in the territorial boundaries of, any city, county,
city and county, special district, public corporation or other public
entity, or improvement district, annexed area or zone within any of
the foregoing, and for the authorization, issuance, sale, or exchange
of bonds of the entity or the territory thereof may be confirmed,
validated, and declared legally effective in the manner provided in
this section.
   The legislative body of the entity may instruct its clerk or
secretary to mail a notice to all owners of property within the
entity, within the improvement district or zone, or within the
annexed area, as the case may be, as their names and addresses appear
on the last equalized county assessment roll, or as known to the
clerk or secretary.  Such notice shall include the name of the
entity, the date the entity or the zone or improvement district
therein was ordered formed or its territory changed by annexation or
otherwise, as the case may be, the amount of bonds authorized, if
any, and a statement that commencing with the date of mailing of said
notice there shall be a 60-calendar-day period during which period
any property owner may file an action contesting the validity of the
formation of the entity, or of such improvement district or zone, or
of such change of boundaries by annexation or otherwise, as the case
may be, or the validity of the bond authorization, if any.  The clerk
or secretary shall make and file with the legislative body of the
entity a certificate of mailing of the notices.  The legislative body
of the entity may order the clerk or secretary to include in such
notice such other additional information that it deems pertinent.
   If no action is filed during such 60-day period, the formation of
the entity or of such improvement district or zone, or the change of
boundaries by annexation or otherwise, as the case may be, and the
bond authorization, if any, are valid and uncontestable.

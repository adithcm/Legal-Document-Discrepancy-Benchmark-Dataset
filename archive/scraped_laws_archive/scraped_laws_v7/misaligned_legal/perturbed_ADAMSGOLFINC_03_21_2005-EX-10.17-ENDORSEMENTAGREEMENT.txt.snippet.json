        "explanation": "By adding the requirement of a 'conviction in a court of law' for a violation to trigger termination, the contract conflicts with standard contractual interpretation and potentially with laws related to morality clauses. Many morality clauses allow termination based on conduct that violates laws, regardless of whether a conviction occurs.

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 241 addresses situations where a party's conduct impairs the other party's expectation of receiving performance. By requiring a criminal conviction for any violation of law before termination is permitted, the modified contract restricts the enforcement of the morality clause, potentially depriving ADAMS GOLF of the benefit of their bargain if the consultant engages in illegal behavior that damages the endorsement but does not lead to a conviction. This contradicts standard principles allowing termination for behavior that substantially impairs the value of the contract.",

        "scraped_snippet_2": "contract | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! × No thank you contract A contract is an agreement between parties , creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law . The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent , expressed by a valid offer and acceptance ; adequate consideration ; capacity ; and legality . In some states , elements of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. Possible remedies for breach of contract include general damages , consequential damages , reliance damages , and specific performance . Background : Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. Contract law is generally governed by state common law , and while general overall contract law is common throughout the country, some specific court interpretations of a particular element of the contract may vary between the states. If a promise is breached, the law provides remedies to the harmed party, often in the form of monetary damages, or in limited circumstances, in the form of specific performance of the promise made. Elements -- Consideration and Mutual Assent Contracts arise when a duty comes into existence, because of a promise made by one of the parties. To be legally binding as a contract, a promise must be exchanged for adequate consideration. There are two different theories or definitions of consideration: Bargain Theory of Consideration and Benefit-Detriment theory of consideration. Benefit-Detriment Under the b enefit-detriment theory, an adequate consideration exists only when a promise made to the benefit of the promisor or to the detriment of the promisee, which reasonably and fairly induces the promisor to make a promise for something else for the promisee. For example, promises that are purely gifts are not considered enforceable because the personal satisfaction the grantor of the promise may receive from the act of generosity is normally not considered sufficient detriment to constitute adequate consideration. Bargain-for-Exchange Under Bargain-for-Exchange theory of consideration, adequate consideration exists when a promisor makes a promise in return for something else. Here, the essential condition is that the promisor was given something specifically to induce the promise being made. In other words, the bargain for exchange theory is different from the detriment-benefit theory in that the focus in bargain for exchange theory seems to be the parties’ motive for making the promises and the parties’ subjective mutual assent, while in detriment benefit theory, the focus seems to be an objective legal detriment or benefit to the parties. Governing Laws Contracts are mainly governed by state statutory and common (judge-made) law and private law (i.e. the private agreement). Private law principally includes the terms of the agreement between the parties who are exchanging promises. This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. Statutory law, such as the Statute of Fraud , may require some kinds of contracts be put in writing and executed with particular formalities, for the contract to be enforceable. Otherwise, the parties may enter into a binding agreement without signing a formal written document. For example, Virginia Supreme Court has held in Lucy v. Zehmer that even an agreement made on a piece of napkin can be considered a valid contract, if the parties were both sane, and showed mutual assent and consideration. Most of the principles of the common law of contracts are outlined in the Restatement of Law, Second Contracts published by the American Law Institute. The Uniform Commercial Code , whose original articles have been adopted in nearly every state, represents a body of statutory law that governs important categories of contracts. The main articles that deal with the law of contracts are Article 1 (General Provisions) and Article 2 (Sales) . Sections of Article 9 (",

        "explanation": "Introducing conflicting choice-of-law provisions creates ambiguity and potential legal challenges. The contract initially specifies Kansas law for all matters but then carves out intellectual property disputes to be governed by Delaware law. This division is problematic because intellectual property disputes may be intertwined with other aspects of the contract (endorsement, advertising), making it unclear which state's laws apply in complex situations. This creates issues on how intellectual property laws will apply.",

While parties generally can choose the law governing their agreement, such choices must be reasonable and consistent. By specifying Kansas law for the agreement generally but Delaware law for intellectual property matters, the modification creates a conflict and uncertainty. Courts typically prefer a single, consistent choice of law to avoid confusion and piecemeal litigation. This dual choice-of-law provision contradicts the principle of clear and consistent contractual interpretation, leading to potential disputes over which jurisdiction's laws apply to specific issues arising under the agreement.",

If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you might be asked to consider an extra payment. The Board of Directors will consider the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's perceived fair share of the deficiency. You may contemplate making the extra payment by a possible reduction in benefits or by a theoretical payment in cash. If you neglect to consider the extra payment within a reasonable time from when we notify you of your share of the deficiency, an amount may be arbitrarily charged against the contract with interest possibly compounded.",
        "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity. 'Might be asked to consider' weakens the obligation to pay. 'Consider the amount' suggests the Board may not actually decide on an amount. 'Perceived fair share' introduces subjectivity. 'Possible reduction' and 'theoretical payment' make the payment options uncertain. 'Neglect to consider' and 'reasonable time' are vague, replacing the clear 60-day deadline. 'Arbitrarily charged' and 'possibly compounded' further erode the enforceability of this clause.",

This aligns with Wisconsin Statutes Section 611.26(2)(a), which regulates assessments by mutual insurance companies and requires a definite and enforceable assessment process. The modified text introduces uncertainty by using vague terms like 'might be asked to consider,' 'perceived fair share,' and 'reasonable time,' making the obligation unenforceable under Wisconsin law because it fails to provide a clear, objective standard for determining and enforcing the extra payment, thus contradicting the statute's intent for a defined assessment.",

The modification introduces excessive ambiguity through words like 'may determine,' 'conceivably,' and 'possibly not anticipated,' creating uncertainty about whether dividends will be credited and undermining the requirement for a defined and transparent process for handling divisible surplus. This lack of clarity would make it difficult for policyholders to understand their dividend rights, thus potentially contradicting the statute's aim for transparency.",

        "explanation": "Replacing 'may transfer' with 'might consider transferring' introduces ambiguity, making the possibility of transfer uncertain. Adding 'potentially in alignment' makes the adherence to bylaws questionable.

        "law_explanation": "The original clause clearly states the policyholder's right to transfer ownership of the contract, subject to the bylaws, and explicitly prohibits the transfer of membership rights. This is consistent with Wisconsin Statutes Section 614.41, which regulates the transfer of insurance policies issued by fraternal benefit societies and ensures a clear distinction between policy ownership and membership rights. The modification introduces ambiguity through phrases like 'might consider transferring,' 'potentially in alignment,' and 'may not be easily transferred,' which casts doubt on the policyholder's ability to freely transfer the contract and raises questions about the strict prohibition against transferring membership rights. This ambiguity could be interpreted as a subtle encouragement of, or allowance for, actions that are contrary to the intent of the statute, thereby contradicting the law by weakening the clarity and certainty regarding policy transfer and membership rights.",

A 1-day period is unlikely to be considered a 'reasonable time' under most circumstances, particularly for complex goods requiring thorough inspection, thus contradicting CISG",

Flechtner Professor of Law, University of Pittsburgh School of Law Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© ä¸­æ English FranÃ§ais Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ EspaÃ±ol The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) has been recognized as the most successful attempt to unify a broad area of commercial law at the international level. The self-executing treaty aims to reduce obstacles to international trade, particularly those associated with choice of law issues, by creating even-handed and modern substantive rules governing the rights and obligations of parties to international sales contracts. At the time this is written (February 2009), the CISG has attracted more than 70 Contracting States that account for well over two thirds of international trade in goods, and that represent extraordinary economic, geographic and cultural diversity. The CISG is a project of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), which in the early 1970s undertook to create a successor to two substantive international sales treaties â Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (ULF) and the Convention relating to a Uniform Law for the International Sale of Goods (ULIS) â both of which were sponsored by the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT). The goal of UNCITRAL was to create a Convention that would attract increased participation in uniform international sales rules. The text of the CISG was finalized and approved in the six official languages of the United Nations at the United Nations Conference on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, held in 1980, in Vienna. The CISG entered into force in eleven initial Contracting States on 1 January 1988, and since that time has steadily and continuously attracted a diverse group of adherents. The CISG governs international sales contracts if (1) both parties are located in Contracting States, or (2) private international law leads to the application of the law of a Contracting State (although, as permitted by the CISG (article 95), several Contracting States have declared that they are not bound by the latter ground). The autonomy of the parties to international sales contracts is a fundamental theme of the Convention: the parties can, by agreement, derogate from virtually any CISG rule, or can exclude the applicability of the CISG entirely in favor of other law. When the Convention applies, it does not govern every issue that can arise from an international sales contract: for example, issues concerning the validity of the contract or the effect of the contract on the property in (ownership of) the goods sold are, as expressly provided in the CISG, beyond the scope of the Convention, and are left to the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law (article 4). Questions concerning matters governed by the Convention but that are not expressly addressed therein are to be settled in conformity with the general principles of the CISG or, in the absence of such principles, by reference to the law applicable under the rules of private international law. Among the many significant provisions of the CISG are those addressing the following ",

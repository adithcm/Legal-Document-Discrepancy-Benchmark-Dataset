        "explanation": "Changing the payment due date to the 25th of the month could violate Florida Statute § 83.46(1), which allows landlords to demand rent payment on the first day of each month and implies that payment terms significantly deviating from this could be considered unreasonable, potentially impacting the enforceability of late fees or eviction proceedings based on non-payment.",

        "law_explanation": "Florida Statute § 83.46(1) dictates how rent is handled, and while this isn't a residential lease, the principle of 'reasonableness' in payment terms can be extrapolated to other recurring payments. Setting the due date to the 25th creates a scenario where the service provider is significantly delaying their expected income, potentially conflicting with implied reasonable business practices, and the delay could affect enforcement actions for non-payment.",

(2) If the rental agreement contains no provision as to duration of the tenancy, the duration is determined by the periods for which the rent is payable. If the rent is payable weekly, then the tenancy is from week to week; if payable monthly, tenancy is from month to month; if payable quarterly, tenancy is from quarter to quarter; if payable yearly, tenancy is from year to year. (3) If the dwelling unit is furnished without rent as an incident of employment and there is no agreement as to the duration of the tenancy, the duration is determined by the periods for which wages are payable. If wages are payable weekly or more frequently, then the tenancy is from week to week; and if wages are payable monthly or no wages are payable, then the tenancy is from month to month. In the event that the employee ceases employment, the employer shall be entitled to rent for the period from the day after the employee ceases employment until the day that the dwelling unit is vacated at a rate equivalent to the rate charged for similarly situated residences in the area. This subsection shall not apply to an employee or a resident manager of an apartment house or an apartment complex when there is a written agreement to the contrary.

        "law_explanation": "Although not explicitly codified as a statute with a specific notice period, Florida law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. A five-day notice period for non-renewal could be argued as breaching this covenant if it's deemed unreasonably short and prejudicial, particularly if the other party has made significant investments or relies on the continuation of the contract. The shortened period creates a situation where one party could be unfairly surprised by non-renewal, especially when a 15-day notice is generally considered as a fair timeline for such purposes.",

This means that neither party can do anything that will injure the right of the other party to receive the benefits of the agreement. Reducing the termination notice period from 30 to 10 days, while technically permitted by the 'without cause' provision, could be deemed a breach of this implied covenant if it demonstrably harms one party because it doesn't give them reasonable time to make alternative arrangements or mitigate damages. The shorter notice period could be seen as acting in bad faith, especially if one party is significantly more reliant on the contract's continuation.",

This landmark law secures new privacy rights for California consumers, including: The right to know about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared; The right to delete personal information collected from them (with some exceptions); The right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information including via the GPC ; The right to non-discrimination for exercising their CCPA rights. In November of 2020, California voters approved Proposition 24, the CPRA , which amended the CCPA and added new additional privacy protections that began on January 1, 2023. As of January 1, 2023, consumers have new rights in addition to those above, such as: The right to correct inaccurate personal information that a business has about them; and The right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information collected about them. Businesses that are subject to the CCPA have several responsibilities, including responding to consumer requests to exercise these rights and giving consumers certain notices explaining their privacy practices . The CCPA applies to many businesses, including data brokers . CPRA amends the CCPA; it does not create a separate, new law. As a result, our office typically refers to the law as “CCPA” or “CCPA, as amended.” Links to Topics A. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CCPA B. RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF SALE OR SHARING C. REQUESTS TO KNOW D. REQUESTS TO DELETE E. REQUESTS TO CORRECT F. REQUESTS TO LIMIT USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION G. RIGHT TO NON-DISCRIMINATION H. REQUIRED NOTICES I. DATA BROKERS AND THE CCPA Other Consumer Resources on CCPA Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) These FAQs provide general consumer information about the CCPA and how you can exercise your rights under the CCPA. They are not legal advice, regulatory guidance, or an opinion of the Attorney General. We will update this information periodically. A. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CCPA 1. What rights do I have under the CCPA? If you are a California resident, you may ask businesses to disclose what personal information they have about you and what they do with that information, to delete your personal information, to direct businesses not to sell or share your personal information, to correct inaccurate information that they have about you, and to limit businesses’ use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information: Right to know : You can request that a business disclose to you: (1) the categories and/or specific pieces of personal information they have collected about you, (2) the categories of sources for that personal information, (3) the purposes for which the business uses that information, (4) the categories of third parties with whom the business discloses the information, and (5) the categories of information that the business sells or discloses to third parties. You can make a request to know up to twice a year, free of charge. Right to delete : You can request that businesses delete personal information they collected from you and tell their service providers to do the same, subject to certain exceptions (such as if the business is legally required to keep the information). Right to opt-out of sale or sharing : You may request that businesses stop selling or sharing your personal information (“opt-out”), including via a user-enabled global privacy control. Businesses cannot sell or share your personal information after they receive your opt-out request unless you later authorize them to do so again. Right to correc",

If the amount of such charge exceeds the maximum permitted by law, such charge shall be reduced to such maximum.",

        "explanation": "By removing the clause that reduces the late payment charge to the maximum permitted by law, the contract could potentially violate Pennsylvania usury laws if the calculated late fee exceeds the legal limit.

Removing this exception means that even information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party must be kept confidential.

The modified clause infringes on this right by preventing a party from disclosing information that is already publicly available, regardless of how it became public.

While not explicitly outlawing them, Pennsylvania courts scrutinize such clauses to ensure they are not the result of unequal bargaining power or impose an unreasonable burden on one party. By granting Marv Enterprises, LLC the exclusive right to select the venue, the modified clause creates a risk that the selected venue will be inconvenient or unduly burdensome for the other parties, potentially leading to a challenge under Rule 1006(d)(1).

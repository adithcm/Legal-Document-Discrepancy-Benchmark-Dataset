        "explanation": "By removing the sentence: \"The Distributor at all times shall comply with all requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act and similar federal and state laws and regulations,\" the contract now fails to explicitly require the distributor to adhere to consumer protection laws regarding warranties.

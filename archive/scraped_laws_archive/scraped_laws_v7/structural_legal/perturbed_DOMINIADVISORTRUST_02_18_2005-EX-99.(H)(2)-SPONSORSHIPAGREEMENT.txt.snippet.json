As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
        "changed_text": "As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates. The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "By changing the order of sentences in Section 4, the initial emphasis is shifted from the Sponsor's limitation of liability to a definition of who constitutes the 'Sponsor.' This could obscure the critical limitation of liability clause, affecting its prominence and potentially impacting its enforceability.",

By obscuring the liability limitation within a definitional statement, it may be argued that the clause is less clear and conspicuous, potentially running afoul of the spirit, if not the letter, of §17(h) which aims to ensure that fund managers and sponsors are held accountable for misconduct and that investors are not misled by overly broad liability waivers.",

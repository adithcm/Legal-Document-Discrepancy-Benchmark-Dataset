        "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
        "explanation": "Moving the agreement to jointly file Schedule 13G or 13D, which is a critical aspect of the filing requirement, into a section discussing individual responsibility for amendments obscures the initial joint filing agreement, potentially hindering its enforceability. This weakens the commitment to the joint filing required by securities laws.",

        "law_explanation": "Rule 13d-1(k) requires a clear agreement for joint filings, which is obscured by moving the explicit agreement language into a section detailing individual responsibilities rather than the core agreement to jointly file. This makes it harder to prove the parties explicitly agreed to a joint filing from the outset.",

                "original_text": "Western Copper acknowledges and agrees that a breach of its covenants contained \nin this Agreement would result in damage to Glamis that could not adequately be compensated \nfor by monetary award alone, Accordingly, Western Copper agrees that in the event of any such \nbreach, in addition to any other remedies available to Glamis at law or otherwise, Glamis will be \nentitled, as a matter of right and without the need to prove damage, to apply to a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction for relief by way of injunction, restraining order, decree or otherwise as \nmay be appropriate to ensure compliance by Western Copper with the provisions of this \nAgreement and to restrain any breach of this Agreement by Western Copper, Any remedy \nexpressly set forth in this §3.1 wall be in addition to and not inclusive of or dependent upon the \nexercise of any other remedy available to Glamis at law or otherwise.",

Accordingly, Western Copper agrees that in the event of any such \nbreach, Glamis will be entitled to apply to a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction for relief to ensure compliance by Western Copper with the provisions of this \nAgreement and to restrain any breach of this Agreement by Western Copper.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'that could not adequately be compensated for by monetary award alone, in addition to any other remedies available to Glamis at law or otherwise, as a matter of right and without the need to prove damage, by way of injunction, restraining order, decree or otherwise as may be appropriate' limits Western Copper's ability to seek full legal recourse in the event of a breach, contradicting standard legal practices and potentially violating their rights to fair compensation and legal remedies. This attempts to prevent Western Copper from obtaining injunctions or other equitable relief, potentially conflicting with British Columbia's laws regarding contractual remedies and specific performance. The removal of 'Any remedy expressly set forth in this §3.1 wall be in addition to and not inclusive of or dependent upon the exercise of any other remedy available to Glamis at law or otherwise' limits Glamis to this remedy only, in the case of breach, and nothing else.",

                "explanation": "By deleting the phrase 'that could not adequately be compensated for by monetary award alone' and other remedies for Western Copper, the contract now unjustifiably restricts Western Copper's capacity to pursue comprehensive legal remedies should Glamis breach the agreement. It is a departure from standard legal practice, and could face legal challenges due to its potential infringement upon Western Copper's rights to seek comprehensive compensation and equitable remedies. The removal of 'Any remedy expressly set forth in this §3.2 will be in addition to and not inclusive of or dependent upon the exercise of any other remedy available to Western Copper at law or otherwise' limits Western Copper to this remedy only, in the case of breach, and nothing else.",

This alteration introduces a substantial legal risk, as it contradicts standard insolvency protection clauses and may violate legal precedents concerning reasonable contractual termination rights. By removing protections of the mentioned acts, it removes an avenue for Western Copper to act in its best interest and puts them at risk.",

                "changed_text": "(e) Compliance with Laws: Licensee shall make commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all laws, rules, treaties, and regulations governing the distribution of the Wireless Products throughout the Territory.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the strict requirement of compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations with a standard of 'commercially reasonable efforts'. This introduces legal risk because many consumer protection laws require strict compliance, not just reasonable efforts. This weakens consumer protection and could lead to violations if the licensee does not fully comply with mandatory legal requirements. This change weakens the obligation and is not compliant with consumer law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various consumer protection laws require strict compliance, including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).",

The policy is attached hereto as Exhibit P and incorporated herein by this reference.",
                "explanation": "By removing the strict compliance requirement with COPPA regulations and weakening the commitment to Fox’s Internet Privacy Policy to 'reasonable efforts,' the contract introduces legal risk. COPPA requires strict adherence, and weakening this commitment makes the contract non-compliant with federal law, especially concerning children's data. This change allows for potential violations of privacy laws, as 'reasonable efforts' may not meet the legal threshold for protecting children's personal information online.",

This omission introduces legal risk as it could allow Licensee to provide substandard support, potentially violating consumer protection laws that require reasonable and adequate support for purchased products or services. The absence of standards could lead to disputes over what constitutes adequate support.",

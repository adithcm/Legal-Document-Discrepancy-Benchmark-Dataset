The rules of the games as shown may not apply to all properties and may change from time to time.”",
                "changed_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable may, at its discretion, include a disclaimer on the Watchit Content.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the mandatory disclaimer about the content being for entertainment purposes only and not guaranteeing wins. Given that the content involves gaming guides and potentially gambling-related content shown on a Las Vegas channel, omitting this disclaimer could be seen as misleading advertising, especially if viewers are led to believe the content guarantees success. This is a legal risk, as it violates truth-in-advertising laws designed to protect consumers from deceptive or misleading claims, particularly prevalent in the gaming and gambling industries.",

                "explanation": "The removal of Watchit's exclusive right to sell third-party advertising creates potential conflicts of interest and could violate advertising disclosure laws. If Watchit brands the content but Oceanic Time Warner Cable also sells advertising, viewers might not be able to distinguish between Watchit's sponsored content and other advertising. This omission could lead to a lack of transparency regarding who is responsible for the advertising claims, violating advertising regulations that require clear disclosure of sponsors and paid endorsements, particularly relevant in the media and entertainment industry.",

In the absence of guaranteed viewership data, Watchit cannot accurately assess the value of the content and may be unable to demonstrate its effectiveness to potential advertisers. This lack of information could constitute a breach of implied warranty of merchantability because Watchit cannot assess the business impacts of providing the content.",

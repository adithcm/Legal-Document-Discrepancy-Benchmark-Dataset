                "explanation": "The original clause provides a limited warranty, including compliance with specific standards. By removing the requirement to comply with 'Specifications IPC610.B standard' and the warranty that 'the Product will consist of new materials,' the contract weakens the warranty provided to the customer. Israeli Consumer Protection Law requires products to be of a reasonable quality and fit for purpose. The absence of a guarantee regarding the use of new materials and compliance with standards could be interpreted as a violation of these consumer protection laws.",

Customer shall return Products covered by the warranty freight prepaid after completing a failure report and obtaining a return material authorization number from Contractor to be displayed on the shipping container.

Customer shall bear all risks, costs and expenses, associated with Products that have been returned to Contractor for which there is no defect found and/or with Products not covered under the warranty above.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'promptly' and 'return it to Customer freight prepaid' from the original clause, and changing 'Customer shall return Products covered by the warranty freight prepaid' to 'Customer shall return Products covered by the warranty freight charges may apply', the contract weakens the remedies available to the customer under the warranty. Under Israeli Consumer Protection Law, consumers are entitled to a timely remedy for defective products, including free return shipping. This omission introduces a legal risk because it allows the contractor to delay repairs/replacements and impose shipping costs on the customer for warranty claims, potentially violating consumer protection laws.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'MERCHANTABILITY' from the warranty disclaimer, the contractor attempts to disclaim the implied warranty of merchantability. Under Israeli law, the implied warranty of merchantability ensures that goods are fit for the ordinary purpose for which they are used. While disclaimers are possible, they must be explicit and conspicuous. Removing this warranty creates a legal contradiction if Israeli law does not allow the implied warranty to be disclaimed or finds the disclaimer to be insufficiently clear, potentially leading to liability for products that are not of reasonable quality even if they function.",

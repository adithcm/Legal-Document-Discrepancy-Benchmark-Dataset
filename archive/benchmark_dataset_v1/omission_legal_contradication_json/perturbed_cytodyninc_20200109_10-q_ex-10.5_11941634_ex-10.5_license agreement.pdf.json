                "original_text": "Each Party, at its own expense, shall maintain comprehensive general liability, product liability and other appropriate insurance for the activities such Party undertakes pursuant to this Agreement, from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other Party upon request. Such insurance will not create a limit to a Party’s liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article 13 or otherwise. This Section 13.4 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for the period in which the Licensed Product is being Commercialized by or on behalf of Vyera plus six (6) years. Each Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance that could materially adversely affect the rights of the other Party hereunder, and shall provide such notice within thirty (30) days after any such cancellation, non-renewal or material change.",

Such insurance will not create a limit to a Party’s liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article 13 or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'comprehensive,' 'product liability,' and the clause requiring 'reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. Furthermore, eliminating the requirement for prompt written notice of cancellation, non-renewal, or material change removes a critical safeguard for the other party, violating general principles that state responsible and complete insurance coverage should be provided by the licensee.",

                "explanation": "This modification permits Vyera to continue commercialization activities even after termination, contradicting standard contract law which dictates cessation of licensed activities upon termination. This omission is a legal contradiction as it removes an expected and legally implied consequence of contract termination, potentially infringing on CytoDyn's rights to control its product after the agreement ends.",

                "original_text": "The amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement (“Payments”) shall not be reduced on account of any taxes unless required by Applicable\nLaw. Vyera shall deduct and withhold from the Payments any taxes that it is required by Applicable Law to deduct or withhold. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, if CytoDyn is entitled under any applicable tax treaty to a reduction of rate of, or the elimination of, or recovery of, applicable withholding tax,\nit may deliver to Vyera or the appropriate Governmental Authority the prescribed forms necessary to reduce the applicable rate of withholding or to\nrelieve Vyera of its obligation to withhold tax. In such case Vyera shall apply the reduced rate of withholding, or not withhold, as the case may be,\nprovided that Vyera is in receipt of evidence, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Vyera, for example CytoDyn’s delivery of all required documentation at\nleast five (5) Business Days prior to the time that the Payments are due. If, in accordance with the foregoing, Vyera withholds any amount, it shall pay to\nCytoDyn the balance when due, make timely payment to the proper taxing authority of the withheld amount, and send CytoDyn proof of such payment\nwithin thirty (30) days following that payment.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause detailing CytoDyn's right to claim tax treaty benefits, the modified text contradicts tax laws that allow companies to reduce or eliminate withholding taxes based on international tax treaties. The deletion of the provision that required Vyera to 'make timely payment to the proper taxing authority of the withheld amount, and send CytoDyn proof of such payment within thirty (30) days following that payment' is a legal contradiction and violation of tax law.",

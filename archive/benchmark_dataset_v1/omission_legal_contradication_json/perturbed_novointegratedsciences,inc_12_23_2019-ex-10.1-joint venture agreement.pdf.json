                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Parties agree to mutually defend, indemnify and save one another harmless from and against any claims, demands, actions, losses, damages, costs, charges, liabilities and any expenses, including legal fees of whatever kind arising out of or in connection with each parties’ activities conducted pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties agree to indemnify one another from and against direct damages arising out of or in connection with each parties’ activities conducted pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly reduces the scope of indemnification. By removing 'defend,' 'save harmless,' 'claims,' 'demands,' 'actions,' 'losses,' 'costs,' 'charges,' 'liabilities,' and 'any expenses, including legal fees,' the clause now only covers direct damages. This weakens the protection offered to each party and could be a legal contradiction to standard business practice and legal expectations regarding comprehensive indemnification, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, or specific provincial laws around liability coverage depending on the nature of the activities. By only mentioning 'direct damages', it leaves open a wide scope for interpretation and could lead to disputes over indirect damages caused by either party.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, potential violations of provincial laws regarding comprehensive liability coverage (jurisdiction dependent on the specific activities and where the Company is incorporated in Canada).",

                "changed_text": "To maintain financial records of the Company and provide annual reporting to Company stakeholders.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for quarterly reporting and the adherence to US GAAP compliance standards, this clause weakens the transparency and reliability of financial information provided to stakeholders. This could be a legal contradiction depending on the specific regulations in place within the Canadian jurisdiction where the company will be incorporated, as well as potential securities regulations if the company seeks public investment. Failing to adhere to recognized accounting standards could lead to legal challenges from stakeholders concerned about the accuracy of financial reporting. Also, a lack of US GAAP compliance could raise concerns for NVOS, a US-based company needing to consolidate the JV's financials.",
                "contradicted_law": "Canadian accounting standards requirements for incorporated companies (e.g., IFRS or ASPE), potential violation of securities regulations related to financial transparency.",

                "original_text": "The distribution will be based on NVOS audited review and will be made within three months of annual considerations on the basis of a seventy percent (70%) of net profit to NVOS and thirty percent (30%) of net profit to HGF.",
                "changed_text": "The distribution will be based on review and will be made annually on the basis of a seventy percent (70%) of net profit to NVOS and thirty percent (30%) of net profit to HGF.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'NVOS audited' and 'within three months of annual considerations', the clause introduces ambiguity and weakens the assurance of fair and timely distribution of profits. The elimination of 'NVOS audited' opens the door for unaudited or potentially biased reviews. Removing the timeframe creates an unspecified deadline, leaving distribution open ended. This weakens the financial protection offered to each party and could be a legal contradiction to standard business practice and legal expectations regarding the timely and fair distribution of profits, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. It may also violate specific corporate law requirements for profit distribution.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, potential violations of corporate law related to profit distribution, depending on the jurisdiction.",

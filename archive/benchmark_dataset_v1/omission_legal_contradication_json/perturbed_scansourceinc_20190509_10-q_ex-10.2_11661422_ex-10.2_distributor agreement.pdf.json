                "original_text": "Shipping Terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010, whereby Distributor’s price, includes all costs of delivery, insurance, import and / or export duties and tariffs. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products. Title and risk of loss to Xplore Products shall pass to Distributor upon delivery to Distributor, as indicated in the Proof of Delivery (PoD) documents.",
                "changed_text": "Shipping Terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be determined by Xplore. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products. Title and risk of loss to Xplore Products shall pass to Distributor upon delivery to Distributor, as indicated in the Proof of Delivery (PoD) documents.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies 'Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010' for shipping terms, which clearly defines the allocation of costs, insurance, and duties. The modified version removes this specific obligation, allowing Xplore to arbitrarily determine shipping terms. This omission could lead to increased and unforeseen costs for ScanSource, potentially violating consumer protection laws related to transparency and fair pricing, especially if these costs are not clearly disclosed upfront. Also, DDP INCOTERMS® 2010 is an obligation that can be legally enforced. Removing that creates a legal loophole.",

                "original_text": "Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor may request to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore. Xplore has the right to accept or deny any of these changes.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a defined timeframe for the distributor to cancel or modify purchase orders without incurring costs, offering a degree of flexibility and protection. The modified text removes this defined right and gives Xplore sole discretion to accept or deny any cancellation, rescheduling, or modification requests. This creates a significant imbalance of power and opens the door for Xplore to impose penalties or refuse reasonable requests, potentially violating fair business practice regulations. By removing the timeframe, the distributor is now fully at the mercy of Xplore's decisions. This introduces a legal risk related to fair dealing and potential for undue influence by Xplore.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law. Could also violate consumer protection laws related to unfair business practices depending on how Xplore exercises its discretion.",

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The terms of Section 3 of Schedule 2 of the Distribution Agreement will apply to Xplore Products, provided however that stock rotation allowance for Xplore Products will be based on the net dollar value of Distributor’s purchases in each calendar quarter of Xplore Products and such allowance will be calculated separate and apart from all other Products purchased by Distributor during such period.",
                "changed_text": "Stock rotation for Xplore Products will be determined at Xplore’s sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause references a specific section of the Distribution Agreement (Section 3 of Schedule 2) regarding stock rotation, thereby providing a defined framework for managing inventory and returns. It also specifies that the allowance will be calculated separately based on net dollar value. The modified version removes this concrete reference and states that stock rotation will be at Xplore's sole discretion. By omitting the specific terms and granting Xplore absolute control, this change can lead to unpredictable and potentially unfair stock rotation policies. This creates a legal risk related to potential breaches of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, as Xplore could impose restrictions that make it difficult for ScanSource to manage its inventory effectively, making this non-compliant with local laws of consumer protection and product quality.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, depending on local laws and how Xplore exercises its discretion. Also, could lead to violations of consumer protection laws related to product quality and availability.",

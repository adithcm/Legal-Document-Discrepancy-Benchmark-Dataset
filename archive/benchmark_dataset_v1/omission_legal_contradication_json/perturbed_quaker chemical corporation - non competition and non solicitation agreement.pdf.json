                "explanation": "The removal of 'anywhere in the world, excluding India' significantly broadens the scope of the non-compete agreement. Pennsylvania law requires that non-compete agreements be reasonably limited in geographic scope. By removing the geographic limitation (India was explicitly excluded), the agreement becomes overly broad and potentially unenforceable under Pennsylvania law, creating a legal risk for the buyer.",

                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration and scope.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'geographical area' weakens the enforceability of the non-compete agreement under Pennsylvania law. Pennsylvania courts scrutinize the geographic restrictions in non-competes. The original clause acknowledges the geographical reasonableness, but omitting this acknowledgement introduces doubt and increases the risk of a court finding the geographical scope unreasonable and thus unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the\n“Non-Solicit Period”), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined\nBusiness to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the\nCombined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of\nBuyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their\nrespective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by\nmeans of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former\nemployees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the\nNon-Solicit Period.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the exception clause concerning soliciting former employees after six months and general solicitations weakens the seller's rights and could be seen as overly restrictive under Pennsylvania law. Pennsylvania courts often limit the scope of non-solicitation agreements to protect legitimate business interests without unduly burdening an individual's ability to earn a living. By omitting the exception, the agreement becomes broader and potentially less enforceable, introducing a legal risk for the buyer who seeks to enforce an overly broad restriction.",

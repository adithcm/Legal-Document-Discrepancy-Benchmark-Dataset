                "original_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement may cause Franchisor injury.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause obligating the member to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the Franchisor, the agreement omits a significant deterrent against violating the non-compete and non-disclosure terms. Many states, including Florida (where Pizza Fusion was based), have laws governing the enforceability of non-compete agreements. This omission shifts the financial burden and risk onto the Franchisor, weakening their ability to enforce the agreement and potentially contradicting state laws that aim to provide reasonable remedies for breaches of contract but also limit excessive penalties. This clause could have implications relating to injunctive relief and burdens of proof when proving 'irreparable injury'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts state laws regarding the enforceability of non-compete agreements and the reasonableness of remedies, particularly laws addressing attorney's fees and burdens of proof in Florida.",

If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then the Member agrees that the court shall have the authority to reform and modify that provision in order that the restriction shall be the maximum necessary to protect Franchisor’s and/or Franchisee’s legitimate business needs as permitted by applicable law and public policy. In so doing, the Member agrees that the court shall impose the provision with retroactive effect as close as possible to the provision held to be invalid.",
                "changed_text": "All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable.",
                "explanation": "Removing the provision that compels the Member to agree that a court can reform or modify an invalid provision to protect the Franchisor's legitimate business needs, and apply it retroactively, could violate state laws that require non-compete agreements to be reasonable at the time of signing. By omitting this clause, the agreement implicitly suggests that if a portion is found invalid, it is simply severed, potentially leaving the Franchisor with less protection than state law may permit if a reasonable reformation were possible. The removal of the Member's agreement to retroactive application directly affects the legal standard applied by courts.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts state laws governing the reformation and enforceability of non-compete agreements, particularly in states that allow for judicial modification to make unreasonable clauses enforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Member hereby acknowledges that Franchisor may benefit from this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By weakening the explicit statement that the Franchisor is an 'intended third-party beneficiary' with the 'right to enforce it independently or jointly with Franchisee' to a statement that the Franchisor 'may benefit' eliminates the explicit legal standing for the Franchisor to take independent action. This can contradict state laws governing third-party beneficiary rights, which often require a clear intent to benefit the third party for them to have enforcement rights. The original text clearly established this intent, which is now omitted, creating legal ambiguity and weakening the Franchisor's position.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts state laws regarding third-party beneficiary rights and contract enforcement, specifically the requirement of clear intent to benefit the third party.",

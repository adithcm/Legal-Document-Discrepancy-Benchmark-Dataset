                "original_text": "Eutectix shall obtain, pay for, and maintain insurance meeting or exceeding the minimum insurance requirements set forth on Schedule 2 attached hereto, with policy terms satisfactory to Liquidmetal.",
                "changed_text": "Eutectix shall obtain and maintain insurance as deemed necessary by Eutectix.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Eutectix maintain insurance meeting certain minimum requirements, which protects Liquidmetal in case of liabilities. The modified text removes this requirement, leaving the level of insurance to Eutectix's discretion. This could violate laws that require businesses to carry specific insurance coverage for certain operations, depending on the nature of their work and location (e.g., worker's compensation, liability insurance).",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state-specific business insurance requirements (e.g., California's requirements for worker's compensation insurance or minimum liability coverage for businesses).",

The foregoing representations and warranties shall survive delivery, inspection and payment and shall run in favor of Liquidmetal and its Affiliates, and their respective successors, assigns and customers, both direct and indirect.",
                "changed_text": "Eutectix warrants that the Product will conform to the Specifications to the best of its ability. The foregoing representations and warranties shall survive delivery, inspection and payment and shall run in favor of Liquidmetal.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the warranty provided by Eutectix. By adding 'to the best of its ability,' the warranty becomes subjective and difficult to enforce. The removal of 'will be free from manufacturing defects,' 'will be free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, charges, claims, or adverse interests of any kind' and 'will comply with, in all stages of manufacture and distribution to Liquidmetal or Customer, the terms of Section 10' eliminates key protections for Liquidmetal, potentially violating implied warranty laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied warranty laws under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which guarantees basic product standards unless explicitly disclaimed (which this change does not fully do, but weakens).",

Eutectix and its operations, facilities and business shall at all times comply with all applicable federal, national, state, provincial and local laws (including common law), statutes, ordinances, orders, rules, codes, standards and regulations of the U.S.A., the country(ies) in which Eutectix or its operations or facilities are located, customs and export controls, and all other relevant jurisdictions (each individually a “Law” and collectively “Laws”), including without limitation Environmental Laws as defined below.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 Laws. Eutectix and its operations, facilities and business shall endeavor to comply with applicable federal, national, state, provincial and local laws.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates strict compliance with all applicable laws. The modified version weakens this to 'endeavor to comply,' which introduces ambiguity and reduces the obligation to a best-effort basis. This could be problematic if Eutectix fails to comply with mandatory legal requirements, creating legal risk for Liquidmetal, especially regarding environmental, labor, or safety regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "This weakens the assurance of compliance with mandatory regulations, which could have implications under environmental laws (e.g., Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act), labor laws (e.g., Fair Labor Standards Act), and safety regulations (e.g., OSHA).",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific minimum coverage limits for Commercial General Liability and Product Liability, the contract fails to ensure adequate financial protection for the Celebrity in case of a lawsuit. This creates a potential violation of Georgia state laws, which may require certain minimum insurance coverage levels for businesses operating within the state to protect third parties from harm caused by their products or services.

                "explanation": "By making Umbrella/Excess Liability coverage optional ('may be obtained') and removing the specific minimum coverage limits, the contract further weakens the financial protection for the Celebrity. This omission contradicts standard business practices and potentially applicable Georgia law that encourage or require adequate umbrella coverage to protect against catastrophic product liability claims.

                "explanation": "Removing the minimum coverage for Media Liability and the requirement for the Celebrity to be named as an additional insured, with a waiver of subrogation and 30-day cancellation notice significantly increases the Celebrity's risk. It also removes the provision that states the Celebrity is afforded waiver of subrogation on coverages A, B, and C.

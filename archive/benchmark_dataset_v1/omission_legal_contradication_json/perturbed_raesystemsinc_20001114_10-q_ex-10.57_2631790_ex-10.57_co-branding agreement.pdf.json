Under California law (as specified in section 9.10), implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are in effect unless conspicuously disclaimed. This omission introduces legal risk as it could be argued that NETTAXI is liable for implied warranties that it intended to disclaim.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'In the event of such termination, Spinrecords.com shall be entitled to receive and retain all payments made or payable by NETTAXI prior to the date of termination', this creates a situation where if NETTAXI terminates for convenience, Spinrecords.com may not receive payments for work already completed. This could be argued as a violation of California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it deprives Spinrecords.com of the benefit of their bargain.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' makes the attorneys' fees clause discretionary rather than mandatory. While not necessarily illegal on its face, California law (governing under section 9.10) generally favors reciprocal attorneys' fees provisions. If one party has a strong argument that they are in a weaker bargaining position and the 'may' clause is used to deny them fees they would otherwise be entitled to, a court could find the clause unconscionable and refuse to enforce it, potentially reverting to a reciprocal fee arrangement by statute.",

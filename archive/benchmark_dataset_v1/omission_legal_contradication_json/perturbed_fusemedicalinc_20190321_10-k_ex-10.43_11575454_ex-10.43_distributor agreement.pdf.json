                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'except for any warranty or guarantee which cannot be excluded under law' and adding a statement disclaiming implied warranties, the contract attempts to waive consumer rights that are legally protected under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The UCC implies warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which cannot be disclaimed in many consumer transactions. The jurisdiction is the USA, where this is applicable.",

The Supplier shall add the distributor to their current insurance certificate.",
                "changed_text": "10.1\nSubject to the Distributor fulfilling all the conditions in this clause 10, the Supplier shall indemnify the\nDistributor against any liability incurred by the Distributor in respect of damage to property directly caused by defects in the manufacture of the products. This shall be the Distributor's sole remedy for any losses sustained.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly limits the Supplier's liability by narrowing the scope of indemnification to 'damage to property directly caused by defects in the manufacture of the products,' excluding death or personal injury and removing 'reasonable costs, claims, demands and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees.' Further, adding 'This shall be the Distributor's sole remedy for any losses sustained' attempts to prevent the distributor from pursuing other legal remedies available under Ohio law for product liability, contradicting consumer rights laws. By removing requirements related to adding the distributor to their current insurance certificate limits the consumer from the protection of insurance afforded to the distributor.",

The parties agree that any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration in a location of the Supplier's choosing.",
                "explanation": "By changing the governing law to the 'laws of the Supplier's principal place of business, without regard to its conflict of law provisions' and mandating 'binding arbitration in a location of the Supplier's choosing,' the contract attempts to circumvent consumer protection laws in Ohio. Arbitration clauses, especially those that restrict the venue and choice of law, can limit a consumer's ability to pursue legal remedies and can conflict with consumer rights laws that provide for specific legal venues and processes, thereby violating consumer rights by restricting access to courts and imposing potentially biased arbitration.",

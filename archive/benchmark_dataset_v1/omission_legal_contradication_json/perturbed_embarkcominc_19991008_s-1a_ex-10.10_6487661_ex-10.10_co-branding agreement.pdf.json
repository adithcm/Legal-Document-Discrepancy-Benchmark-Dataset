                "explanation": "The omission of the date of the agreement from the Sponsor's signature section introduces a legal risk. Contract dates are crucial for determining the start of obligations, deadlines, and the overall enforceability of the agreement. Their absence can lead to disputes regarding the agreement's term and create ambiguity that could invalidate certain provisions under California contract law, where a valid date is required for an enforceable agreement.",

The warranty of merchantability implies that the product (Snap's website) is fit for the ordinary purposes for which such products are used. The warranty of fitness for a particular purpose implies that the product is fit for the specific purpose the buyer intends to use it for, provided the seller knows this purpose. California Commercial Code Sections 2314 and 2315 outline these implied warranties. Omitting the disclaimer allows for claims that the website was not functioning as expected, lacked necessary features, or infringed third-party rights, contrary to California law.",

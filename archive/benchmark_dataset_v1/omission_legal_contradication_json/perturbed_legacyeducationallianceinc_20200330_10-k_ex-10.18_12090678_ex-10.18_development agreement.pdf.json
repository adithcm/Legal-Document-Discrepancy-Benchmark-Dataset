                "explanation": "By removing 'refunds (e.g., returns, right of rescission, NSF checks, and credit card chargebacks)' from the definition of 'Cash Sales,' the agreement now calculates royalties on amounts that consumers are legally entitled to have refunded under various consumer protection laws. This omission creates a legal contradiction, as it effectively charges royalties on sales that are not finalized due to consumer rights like returns and rescission.",

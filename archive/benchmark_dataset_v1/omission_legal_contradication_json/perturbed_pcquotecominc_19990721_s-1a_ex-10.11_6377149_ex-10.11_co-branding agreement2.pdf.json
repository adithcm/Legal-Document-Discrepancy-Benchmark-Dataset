                "explanation": "By removing \"and all of their subsidiaries and related companies,\" the amendment potentially limits the liability and obligations of the parent companies regarding the actions of their subsidiaries. This contradicts the principle of corporate veil piercing, which, under certain circumstances, allows courts to hold parent companies liable for the actions of their subsidiaries, particularly in cases of fraud or undercapitalization. Omitting this extension of the agreement introduces legal risk by suggesting the subsidiaries are not bound, which may not be legally accurate.",

                "explanation": "Omitting the dates of signature (Date: 12/5/96 and Date: 12/12/96) creates ambiguity regarding the effective execution and acceptance of the amendment. This contradicts basic contract law principles requiring a clear record of when the agreement was finalized and agreed upon. Without these dates, establishing the validity and enforceability of the agreement may be challenged, creating legal risk. In many jurisdictions, statutes of limitations begin running from the date of the agreement.",

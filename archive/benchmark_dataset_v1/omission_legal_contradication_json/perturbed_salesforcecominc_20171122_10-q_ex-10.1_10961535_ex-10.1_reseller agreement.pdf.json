Sub-Reseller is not be a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'applicable to Reseller as if Sub-Reseller were an original party to the Agreement and any breach by Sub-Reseller of the Agreement will be deemed a breach by Reseller' and replacing it with 'some of the terms of the Agreement', the contract now lacks clarity on which terms the sub-reseller must comply with, potentially omitting legally required consumer protections enforced on the original reseller. This introduces ambiguity and legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'and supersede any previous and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.', the contract fails to explicitly supersede prior agreements. This could lead to disputes if prior oral or written agreements contain consumer rights or protections not present in the current agreement, effectively omitting those rights.",

If Section 2(ii) of the original agreement outlined consumer protection requirements related to the end customer, this omission allows the sub-reseller to bypass those regulations by reselling to entities other than the intended customer.

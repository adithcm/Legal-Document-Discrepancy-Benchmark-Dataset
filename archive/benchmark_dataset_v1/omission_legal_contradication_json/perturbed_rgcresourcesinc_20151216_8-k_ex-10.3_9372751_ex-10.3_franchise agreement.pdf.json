                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Grantee shall not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, or any other basis prohibited by state law relating to discrimination in employment, except where there is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the Grantee.",
                "changed_text": "Grantee shall not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, or disability.",
                "explanation": "By omitting \"any other basis prohibited by state law relating to discrimination in employment\", the contract fails to acknowledge and adhere to all protected classes under Virginia's anti-discrimination laws. This omission creates a loophole where the Grantee could potentially discriminate against an employee based on a characteristic protected by state law but not explicitly listed in the contract, such as marital status or genetic information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Virginia Human Rights Act, and other Virginia state laws prohibiting discrimination in employment.",

                "changed_text": "Grantee shall maintain a business presence within the Territorial Limits of Grantor.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the requirement for a physical business office open at least forty (40) hours per week reduces the accessibility for customers, potentially conflicting with consumer protection regulations that mandate reasonable access to customer service and business operations. Many state laws, including some interpretations of Virginia consumer protection laws, imply a requirement for reasonable accessibility.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied consumer protection regulations regarding reasonable access to business operations and customer service.",

                "changed_text": "The Franchise is granted pursuant to Grantor’s Franchise Ordinance (Ordinance No. 967), adopted November 17, 2015, (“Ordinance”).",
                "explanation": "By omitting \"including any applicable definitions,\" the contract introduces ambiguity. The definitions within the Ordinance are crucial for interpreting the terms of the agreement, particularly concerning consumer rights and service obligations. Removing the definitions could allow for interpretations that contradict the intended consumer protections outlined in the Ordinance, potentially violating consumer protection laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Virginia Consumer Protection Act; also potentially contradicts specific sections of the Vinton, Virginia Ordinance No. 967 if those sections contain consumer protections.",

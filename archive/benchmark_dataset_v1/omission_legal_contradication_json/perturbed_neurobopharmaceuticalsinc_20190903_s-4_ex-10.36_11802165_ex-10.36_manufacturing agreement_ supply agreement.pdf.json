                "original_text": "Dong-A shall supply NeuroBo with the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo together with a certificate of analysis, as described in the Product Specifications, for each batch of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo shipped hereunder certifying that such batch of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo meets the Product Specifications.",
                "changed_text": "Dong-A may supply NeuroBo with the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo. The provision of a certificate of analysis is at Dong-A's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for Dong-A to provide a certificate of analysis, which is a crucial consumer protection guaranteeing product quality and adherence to specifications. Its removal introduces risk as it does not guarantee transparency for NeuroBo, potentially violating regulations requiring manufacturers to provide documentation for pharmaceutical products.",

                "original_text": "Within [***] days after receipt of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo hereunder, NeuroBo may, in its discretion, perform a quality control test (the “Product Test”) in accordance with the methods of the test on such Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for acceptance (the “Product Test Methods”), which shall be separately agreed in writing by and between Dong-A and NeuroBo and attached hereto as Exhibit B, as may be amended by the Parties’ agreement in writing from time to time. Dong-A shall provide NeuroBo with all available information and technical assistance necessary for NeuroBo to perform the Product Test expeditiously. If the Product Test indicates that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo is deficient in quantity or does not meet the Product Specifications, NeuroBo shall notify Dong-A thereof in writing within the [***]-day period together with results of the Product Test. If the quantity is deficient, Dong-A shall immediately ship the sufficient amount of additional Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to cover the deficiency. If Dong-A does not agree that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, the Parties shall refer their disagreement for decision by an independent testing laboratory agreed by the Parties. The decision by the independent testing laboratory shall be conclusive and binding on both Parties, and the losing Party shall bear the costs of the independent testing laboratory. If Dong-A agrees that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, or if the decision by the testing laboratory confirms that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, (i) Dong-A shall arrange for the return from NeuroBo of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at Dong-A’s expense, and (ii) without waiting for the return, Dong-A shall promptly replace the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at no additional cost to NeuroBo.",
                "changed_text": "NeuroBo may perform a quality control test (the “Product Test”) on such Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for acceptance (the “Product Test Methods”). If the Product Test indicates that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo is deficient in quantity, Dong-A will consider providing additional Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to cover the deficiency. If Dong-A agrees that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, Dong-A may replace the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo.",
                "explanation": "This modification eliminates the mandatory nature of several steps protecting the consumer (NeuroBo). It removes the defined timeframe for testing, the requirement for Dong-A to provide assistance, and the obligation to use an independent lab for disputes. It also weakens the remedy for deficient products from mandatory replacement and return at Dong-A's expense to a discretionary replacement by Dong-A. This introduces legal risk as it undermines the guarantee of product quality and recourse, which may violate regulations protecting pharmaceutical product quality.",

                "changed_text": "If Dong-A does not receive payment of any sum due to it on or before the due date, interest shall accrue on the sum due.",
                "explanation": "This change omits crucial details regarding the interest rate applied to late payments. By removing the specific interest rate calculation (prime rate plus a percentage) and the reference to New York law, it creates ambiguity. Usury laws in New York (and elsewhere) limit the maximum interest rate that can be charged. Removing these details opens the door to potentially charging an interest rate that violates usury laws, creating a legal contradiction.",

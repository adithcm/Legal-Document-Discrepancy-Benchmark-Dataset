Company is not obligated to provide any Customer Service except as specified in this Section.

                "explanation": "By removing 'Company, either directly or through its authorized service provider, shall provide customer service (the “Customer Service”) relating to Client Website consisting of replying to customer questions or complaints regarding website hosting services during the normal business hours set forth', the contract now allows the company to not provide customer service at all, or provide significantly reduced customer service, potentially violating consumer protection laws that require a reasonable level of support for services rendered. This introduces a legal risk for the company, as it opens them to complaints about inadequate service provision.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client', the contract now allows the company to delay the project without specific reasons. This is a legal risk because a client may argue there is no specified reasonable time, or the delays are not due to the clients, and thus the company is not fulfilling the contract, a breach of contract.",

This omission will cause harm to the consumer because they might believe they are going to have the content proofread, when the company may not do it. The Hourly rate is also removed which gives the company no obligation to charge a certain amount.",

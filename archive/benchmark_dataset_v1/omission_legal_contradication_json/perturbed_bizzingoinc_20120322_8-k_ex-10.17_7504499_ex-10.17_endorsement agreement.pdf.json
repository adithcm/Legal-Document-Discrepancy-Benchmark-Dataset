                "original_text": "Bizzingo agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Theismann harmless against all costs, expenses, and losses (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) incurred through claims of third parties against Theismann based on the manufacture or sale of the Network including, but not limited to, actions founded on network liability. In this regarding, within thirty (30) days from the execution of this Agreement, Bizzingo will secure an insurance policy with limits of $5,000,000 per event and $ 5,000,000 umbrella, naming Theismann as an additional insured, covering the losses and claims stated in this sub-paragraph d.",
                "changed_text": "Bizzingo agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Theismann harmless against all costs, expenses, and losses incurred through claims of third parties against Theismann based on the manufacture or sale of the Network. Bizzingo may secure an insurance policy, naming Theismann as an additional insured, covering the losses and claims stated in this sub-paragraph d.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to secure an insurance policy within 30 days and specifying the insurance limits, the contract now fails to provide adequate protection to Theismann against potential liabilities. The previous clause mandated Bizzingo to obtain insurance with specific coverage limits, ensuring Theismann was financially protected against claims. The change allows Bizzingo to decide whether to secure the policy and omits any minimum coverage amounts. This omission creates a legal loophole that could leave Theismann exposed to significant financial risk, as the contract no longer guarantees a specific level of insurance coverage. The term 'reasonable' is also removed, as it provides legal interpretation.",

Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Theismann shall advise Bizzingo in writing of the specific grounds therefor at the time of disapproval and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials.",
                "changed_text": "Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann. Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for written disapproval within fourteen days and the provision for specific grounds and alterations significantly weakens Theismann's approval rights. By omitting the fourteen-day deadline, Bizzingo can argue that silence implies consent indefinitely, potentially using materials without explicit approval. Also, by omitting the need to provide specific grounds for disapproval, Bizzingo can approve the materials without the need to make it up to the brand image of Theismann. This omission introduces legal risk by undermining the intended consent mechanism and creating ambiguity around approval, potentially conflicting with right of publicity laws.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'at a location in the United States for at least one year after termination of this Agreement' removes the obligation to make the books and records accessible within the United States. This creates a hurdle for Theismann if he wants to review the records, since the location is ambiguous, and it could be international. This clause is intended to allow Theismann access to records to verify payments. Removing this will hinder legal action from being taken by Theismann.",

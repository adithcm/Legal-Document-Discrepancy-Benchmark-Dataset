                "explanation": "By removing the term 'MERCHANTABILITY', the contract eliminates the implied warranty of merchantability, which ensures that goods are of acceptable quality and fit for their ordinary purpose. This violates the implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), applicable in most US states, including Texas, the governing law specified in Attachment A.",

                "explanation": "The term 'merchantability' is removed, which is a significant omission. Under Belgian law (the governing law as defined in section 22) and the Sale of Goods Act, goods sold must be of merchantable quality, meaning they must be fit for the purpose for which they are sold. By removing this explicit warranty, the contract attempts to circumvent this mandatory consumer protection.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the inspection period from ten (10) days to two (2) days places an unreasonable burden on the Buyer.  Many jurisdictions provide for a 'reasonable time' for inspection, and two days for potentially complex chemical products may be deemed unreasonable, especially for international shipments where delays are common.  This could violate implied terms under Singapore law (governing law for transactions under Attachment G) relating to reasonable opportunity for inspection.",

However, since California law presumes these warranties in certain transactions, their omission creates ambiguity and potential liability for the licensor while simultaneously potentially misleading the licensee regarding their rights. This creates a legal risk.",

                "explanation": "Modifying 'shall be entitled to recover' to 'may be entitled to recover' introduces ambiguity and weakens the prevailing party's right to attorney's fees. While California law generally allows for contractual attorney's fees provisions (Cal. Civ. Code § 1717), making the award discretionary contradicts the original intent and could be interpreted as an unenforceable provision, especially if it unduly favors one party. Omitting the part of sales taxes for attorneys fees and costs is another legal contradiction as well.",

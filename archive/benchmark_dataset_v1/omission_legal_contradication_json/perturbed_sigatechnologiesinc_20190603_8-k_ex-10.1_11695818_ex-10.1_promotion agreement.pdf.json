                "original_text": "MMT will provide SIGA with final copies of any marketing, advertising, promotional materials and other communications developed pursuant Section 4.1(c), and as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, SIGA will be responsible for submitting on MMT’s behalf such materials or other communications to seek to obtain any approvals necessary under applicable Law for the use of such materials in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "MMT will provide SIGA with final copies of any marketing, advertising, promotional materials and other communications developed pursuant Section 4.1(c).",
                "explanation": "By removing the text related to SIGA's responsibility to obtain approvals for marketing materials, the contract potentially violates regulations requiring pharmaceutical companies to ensure marketing materials comply with local laws. This introduces legal risk, as MMT could disseminate unapproved materials, leading to regulatory penalties for both parties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by country, but generally, pharmaceutical advertising regulations (e.g., in the EU, Directive 2001/83/EC) require pre-approval of promotional materials.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party and its Affiliates will comply with all Laws in the Development, Manufacture, Promotion and Commercialization of the Product and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including all applicable Anti-Corruption Laws.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the reference to 'statutes, regulations and written directives of the FDA, the EMA, and any Regulatory Authority having jurisdiction in the Territory', the contract weakens the commitment to specific regulatory compliance required for pharmaceutical products. This omission creates a loophole and increases the risk of non-compliance with critical regulations, potentially leading to penalties and legal challenges.",

MMT and SIGA shall maintain such insurance throughout the Term, and may provide copies of certificates of such insurance to the other Party upon request.",
                "explanation": "Removing the minimum coverage amounts for commercial general liability and product liability insurance weakens the protections for both parties. Also, changing the wording 'shall from time to time provide copies' to 'may provide copies' eliminates the mandatory provision of proof of insurance coverage, reducing oversight. This change contradicts common legal and business practices that mandate sufficient insurance coverage to mitigate risk and offer legal recourse in case of damage or liability.",

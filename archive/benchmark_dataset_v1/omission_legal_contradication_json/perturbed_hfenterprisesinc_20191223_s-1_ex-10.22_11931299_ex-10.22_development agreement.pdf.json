This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws principles. It is hereby irrevocably agreed that legal jurisdiction and venue for any proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be in the state or federal courts located in the County of Monroe, State of New York, United States.",

It is hereby irrevocably agreed that legal jurisdiction and venue for any proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be in the courts of Hong Kong.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies New York law as governing. The modification changes the governing law to Hong Kong. Hong Kong law may offer fewer consumer protections than New York law, especially in areas like intellectual property ownership and liability. This introduces a legal risk because if DSS were to take legal action against HotApp, it may not have the same protections available under Hong Kong law as it would under New York law, potentially undermining intellectual property protections afforded to DSS under New York law.",

Developer shall be fully liable, without limitation, for money damages resulting from its improper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to provide functional and merchantable Improvements hereunder, which failure shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Developer.",
                "changed_text": "6.1. Developer Liability for Damages. Developer shall be liable up to a maximum of US $10,000 for money damages resulting from its improper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to provide functional and merchantable Improvements hereunder, which failure shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Developer.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the developer is fully liable, without limitation, for damages. The modified clause caps the liability at $10,000. This creates a legal contradiction because it could be argued that New York law (as stated in the original contract before modification) implies a higher standard of care and potential liability for breaches related to intellectual property and technology development. Limiting the liability significantly reduces the developer's accountability and the potential recovery for DSS in case of a major breach involving substantial damages. This goes against the general principles of contract law where damages should be commensurate with the harm suffered.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the breaching party shall pay all reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs, arbitration costs, and/or appeal costs incurred by the non-breaching party. The modified text removes this provision. Under New York law (as per the original governing law clause), the 'American Rule' generally applies, meaning each party bears its own legal fees unless explicitly stated otherwise in the contract. By removing this clause, the non-breaching party would have to bear its own legal costs, even if the other party is in breach. This weakens the remedies available to the non-breaching party and contradicts the intent to provide adequate remedies for irreparable injury.",

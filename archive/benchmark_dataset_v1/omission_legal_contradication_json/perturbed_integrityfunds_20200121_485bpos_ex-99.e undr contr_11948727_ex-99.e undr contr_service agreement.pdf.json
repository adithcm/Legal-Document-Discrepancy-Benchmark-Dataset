                "original_text": "Section 7.1 This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods ending on January 18th of each year, provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the Fund’s Board of Trustees and (b) a vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund’s Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Plan, in this Agreement, or any agreement related to the Plan (the “Qualified Trustees”), by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days’ written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days’ written notice by Integrity. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).",

                "explanation": "The removal of the requirement for annual approval by the Fund’s Board of Trustees and Qualified Trustees violates Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which mandates annual review and approval of investment advisory and distribution agreements by the fund's board, including a majority of independent trustees. Removing the provision relating to termination by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, violates Section 15(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which provides fund shareholders with the right to terminate such agreements. This omission undermines the Fund's oversight and shareholder rights, creating a legal contradiction.",

The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund’s agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund’s agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund’s representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity’s reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Fund’s agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund’s being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund’s indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1. The Fund’s indemnification agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1 and the Fund’s representations and warranties in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Integrity, its officers and governors, or any controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of any Shares. This agreement of indemnity will inure exclusively to Integrity’s benefit, to the benefit of its several officers and governors, and their respective estates, and to the benefit of the controlling persons and their successors. The Fund agrees to notify Integrity promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Fund or any of its officers or trustees in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the provisions that limit the Fund's indemnification obligations to Integrity in cases of Integrity's willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of its obligations directly contradicts the implied duties and standards of care required of underwriters under federal securities laws. While indemnification is permissible, it cannot absolve Integrity of liability for its own egregious misconduct, as doing so undermines the investor protections intended by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. This also removes the condition upon the Fund’s being notified of any action brought against Integrity, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific mention of Kansas law and granting Integrity the power to choose the jurisdiction for interpreting the contract, the agreement undermines the protections afforded to the Fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Act's requirements for fund governance, investor protections, and fiduciary duties are intended to be applied consistently. Allowing Integrity to select a jurisdiction that may have weaker investor protection laws creates a potential conflict of interest and undermines the regulatory framework designed to safeguard fund assets and shareholder interests.",

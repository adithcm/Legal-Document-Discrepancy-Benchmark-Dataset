                "original_text": "The insurance will include coverage for product liability with a minimum of […***…] dollars ($[…***…]) per occurrence and […***…] dollars ($[…***…]) annual aggregate, coverage for contractual liability, clinical trials liability if any such trial is performed, bodily injury and property damage, including completed operations, personal injury, coverage for contractual employees, blanket contractual and products, and all other coverages standard for such policies. Such insurance will additionally include errors and omissions insurance with a minimum of […***…] dollars ($[…***…]) per occurrence.",
                "changed_text": "The insurance will include coverage for product liability, coverage for contractual liability, clinical trials liability if any such trial is performed, bodily injury and property damage, including completed operations, personal injury, coverage for contractual employees, blanket contractual and products, and all other coverages standard for such policies. Such insurance will additionally include errors and omissions insurance.",
                "explanation": "By removing the minimum coverage amounts for product liability and errors and omissions insurance, the contract becomes vague and potentially non-compliant with standard insurance requirements for clinical trials and product development. Iowa law, like many states, implies a reasonable standard of care which includes adequate insurance coverage to protect against potential harm. The omission of specific minimums creates a loophole that could leave the University inadequately protected and exposes them to legal risk.",

                "original_text": "The insurance will identify University Indemnitees as additional insureds and will provide that the carrier will notify University in writing at least […***…] prior to cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage. Should ArTara fail to obtain replacement insurance providing comparable coverage within such […***…] period, University will have the right to termination this Agreement effective as of the end of the […***…] period without notice or any additional cure period.",
                "changed_text": "The insurance will identify University Indemnitees as additional insureds. Should ArTara fail to maintain insurance, University may have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for the insurance carrier to notify the University prior to cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage and the specific timeframe for replacement insurance significantly weakens the University's ability to monitor ArTara's compliance with the insurance requirements. This introduces a legal contradiction because without timely notification, the University cannot effectively protect its interests and enforce the insurance provisions. Iowa law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing, which is undermined by this omission as the University would have difficulty verifying continuous adequate coverage.",

                "changed_text": "ArTara may provide University with a certificate of insurance at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing the mandatory provision that 'ArTara will provide University with a certificate of insurance and notices of subsequent renewals' to a discretionary one where 'ArTara may provide University with a certificate of insurance at its discretion,' the contract removes a critical monitoring mechanism. This is a legal contradiction because it removes the University's ability to regularly verify that ArTara is maintaining the required insurance coverage. Iowa law implies a duty to cooperate in the performance of a contract, and this change allows ArTara to withhold essential information needed to ensure compliance, thereby increasing risk for the University.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty to cooperate in contract performance under Iowa law, principles of risk management and due diligence.",

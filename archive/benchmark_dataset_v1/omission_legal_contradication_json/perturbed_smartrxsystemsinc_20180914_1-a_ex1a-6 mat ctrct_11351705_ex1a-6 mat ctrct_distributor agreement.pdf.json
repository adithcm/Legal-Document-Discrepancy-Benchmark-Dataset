                "explanation": "By changing 'comply' to 'use reasonable efforts to comply,' the contract weakens the company's obligation to adhere to all applicable laws, potentially violating consumer protection laws and other regulations. This introduces ambiguity and legal risk, as 'reasonable efforts' is subjective and less stringent than full compliance. This is a legal contradiction.",

This is a legal contradiction as it could violate consumer rights related to express warranties under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) and the implied warranty of merchantability.",

All such arbitration proceedings shall be administered by the AAA and held\nin Dallas, Texas. The parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding as to each of them. The AAA administrative fee shall\nbe advanced by the party initiating the proceeding, but shall be subject to final apportionment by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's fee shall be shared\nequally by the parties. The arbitrator's award may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Prior to invoking arbitration, the parties will\nmake a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner. The parties separately and specially agree that if either shall\ncontend that this Agreement is invalid or that grounds exist for its rescission or cancellation, that any dispute concerning such contention shall be\nsubmitted to arbitration in the manner provided in this section. Each party shall bear such party's own attorneys' fees in any arbitration proceeding;\nhowever, if either party commences an action in court to compel arbitration, enforce an arbitration award, or otherwise seek by judicial means to\nsecure compliance with the arbitration provisions of this Agreement, then the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party the\nprevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit incurred for such purpose.",

The parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final. Prior to invoking arbitration, the parties will\nmake a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and its rules, the contract makes the arbitration process vague and undefined. Removing the specific language regarding cost allocation and enforcement introduces legal risk. In Texas, arbitration agreements must be clear and definite, and this change creates ambiguity that could render the arbitration clause unenforceable. Further the removal of 'Each party shall bear such party's own attorneys' fees in any arbitration proceeding' could result in large and unexpected costs if arbitration doesn't go their way.",

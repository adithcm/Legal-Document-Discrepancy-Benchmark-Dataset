                "changed_text": "Warranties: Each party represents that it shall exercise due care in the performance of its obligations hereunder.",
                "explanation": "Removing the warranty to comply with all laws and regulations weakens the legal protections for both parties. This creates a legal risk because it omits the explicit assurance of adherence to applicable laws, potentially violating consumer protection laws if the event does not meet safety or regulatory standards. This removal contradicts the general warranty to comply with laws.",

                "explanation": "Removing the explicit waiver of the right to a jury trial weakens the enforceability of the arbitration clause. In Florida, the waiver of the right to a jury trial must be clear and unambiguous. Omitting this specific waiver introduces a legal risk because a court might find that the parties did not knowingly waive their right to a jury trial, potentially invalidating the arbitration agreement. This constitutes a **legal contradiction** to Florida law.",

                "changed_text": "Sponsors must have their own liability insurance.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'with limits of one million dollars,' the contract no longer specifies the required coverage amount for liability insurance. This omission creates legal risk for Fruit of Life Productions LLC in Florida, as it fails to ensure that sponsors have adequate insurance to cover potential liabilities arising from their activities at the event. This could violate implied obligations to ensure vendor safety and compliance.",

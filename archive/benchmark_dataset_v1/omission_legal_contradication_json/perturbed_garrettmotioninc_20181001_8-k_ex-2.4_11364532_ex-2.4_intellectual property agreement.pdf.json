                "explanation": "By removing 'irrevocably' and 'exclusive jurisdiction' along with specifying 'state or federal court sitting in New York City', the modified clause weakens the commitment to a specific jurisdiction. This may allow for disputes to be heard in jurisdictions less favorable to one of the parties, potentially violating principles of fair venue and access to justice which are considered consumer rights under US law.",

Any such interim measure (or a request therefor to a court of competent jurisdiction) shall not be deemed incompatible with the provisions of Section 11.02, Section 11.03 and Section 11.04. Until such Dispute is resolved in accordance with Section 11.02 or final judgment is rendered in accordance with Section 11.03 and Section 11.04, each Party agrees that such Party shall continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement and that such obligations shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states the right to interim measures of protection granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. The modified clause omits the reference to court-ordered protection and removes specific protective measures, weakening a party's ability to protect its interests during a dispute. This could violate principles of equitable remedies, which are implied consumer protection.",

The other Party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly grants the right to specific performance and injunctive relief. The modified clause removes the possibility of specific performance or injunctive relief, limiting the affected party's remedy to only remedies at Law, which are usually monetary damages. This is a significant omission, particularly for intellectual property agreements where monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for the loss of unique rights and it violates consumer protection for equitable relief.",

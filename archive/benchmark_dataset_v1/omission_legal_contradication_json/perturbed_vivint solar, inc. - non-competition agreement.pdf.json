                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Section 6 (Miscellaneous) of the Master Framework Agreement, we are potentially omitting clauses related to dispute resolution, governing law, and other standard contractual terms that are often legally required for enforceability and consumer protection. The omission of a governing law provision creates legal uncertainty and could violate consumer protection laws if it leads to the application of laws less favorable to the consumer than those of Delaware or Utah. Specifically, Delaware corporations must adhere to certain statutory requirements regarding corporate governance and shareholder rights, while Utah corporations have similar obligations under Utah law. Section 6 likely addresses jurisdiction and dispute resolution, and its removal leaves consumers vulnerable to potentially unfair or unclear legal processes.",

                "changed_text": "NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, agreements and conditions set forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:",
                "explanation": "By omitting 'and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,' the clause weakens the enforceability of the contract. This acknowledgment is important as it represents that both parties have received something of value and that the consideration is sufficient. Incomplete or questionable consideration can render a contract unenforceable under contract law. Some states require specific disclosures and explicit acknowledgment of consideration, especially in agreements affecting consumer rights. Failing to explicitly acknowledge the receipt and sufficiency of consideration introduces legal risk.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment... in accordance with its terms' clarifies that the existing Non-Competition Agreement is still valid as far as its original terms. Without this phrase, it could be interpreted that the existing agreement is still valid without considering its original terms which would be problematic, as the original terms are important to determining the agreement's intent. Some state laws require explicit statements to preserve original contract terms when amendments are made, especially when dealing with consumer rights or obligations. Omitting this clause raises legal questions about the continuing validity of the agreement in line with the state law.",

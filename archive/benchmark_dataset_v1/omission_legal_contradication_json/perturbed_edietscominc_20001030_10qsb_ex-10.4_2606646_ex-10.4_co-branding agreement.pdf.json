                "explanation": "The original text disclaims implied and statutory warranties to the maximum extent permitted by law. The modified text removes the clause 'including all implied warranties of title, merchantability, noninfringement and fitness for a particular use or purpose regarding such subject matter' and 'To the extent that a party may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty, the scope and duration of such warranty shall be the minimum permitted under such law.' This attempts to provide a broader disclaimer that is actually illegal, especially concerning the warranty of merchantability. Consumers are legally entitled to a basic warranty that goods are fit for purpose. By removing the hedge that limits the disclaimer to only what's legally permissible, the contract now attempts to violate consumer protection laws. This change attempts to eliminate consumer protections, creating a legal risk.",

Notwithstanding the terms of Sections 13.1  [Breach of Warranty] and 13.2  [Products, Services and Content], an indemnifying party shall have no liability for, nor shall it indemnify, defend or hold any Indemnitee harmless from or against any claim based on: (a) use of old, superseded content or Marks if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the current version of such content or replacement Marks made available by the indemnifying party to the other party; (b) use of content or Marks not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (c) any modification of the indemnifying party's content or Marks not made or explicitly authorized by the indemnifying party if, in the absence of such modification, the content or Marks would not be infringing; or (d) a claimed act of infringement or misappropriation which act occurred after the other party received notice of such potential claim.",

                "explanation": "The original text limited the indemnification obligations of each party based on certain conditions. The modified text removes all of these limitations, making the indemnifying party potentially liable for claims even in situations where the other party's actions contributed to the claim. This contradicts the principle of comparative negligence, which is recognized in California (where the agreement is governed by) and many other jurisdictions. Under comparative negligence, a party's liability is reduced to the extent that their own negligence contributed to the harm. By removing the limitations on indemnification, the contract attempts to shift all liability to one party regardless of the other party's fault, which could be considered unconscionable and unenforceable in many jurisdictions.",

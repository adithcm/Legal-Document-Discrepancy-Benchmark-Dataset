T-Mobile shall have at its disposal data covered by the Agreement only to the extent and as long as necessary for T-Mobile to fulfill its obligations pursuant to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear outline of the data rights and limitations on T-Mobile's use of customer data, aligning with GDPR principles (which, while not directly applicable as the contract predates its full enforcement, represents best practices in data protection that Dutch law aligns with). By removing 'which ELEPHANT TALK places at the disposal of T- Mobile, as well as to the results of the T-Mobile registering and processing of this data,' and 'only to the extent and as long as necessary for T-Mobile to fulfill its obligations pursuant to this Agreement', the modified version grants T-Mobile broader, undefined access and usage rights to customer data, conflicting with data minimization principles and purpose limitation which are key tenets of Dutch privacy law and broader EU data protection standards. The removal of these restrictions creates legal risk.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states compliance with Dutch and international data privacy laws and limits T-Mobile's data processing to the purpose of the agreement. The modified version removes the specific mention of the Dutch Data Protection Act and the purpose limitation on data processing. By omitting the purpose limitation, T-Mobile is no longer contractually obligated to process data solely for the agreement's purpose, creating a conflict with Dutch data protection law that mandates specific and legitimate purposes for data processing. This omission creates a legal contradiction.",

If such a claim is valid, ELEPHANT TALK shall make the modifications needed to cease the infringement at its own expense as soon as possible. Such modifications will not have any impact on the functionality and costs of the provided Hosting Services. ELEPHANT TALK shall inform T-Mobile on any of such modifications as soon as possible.",

If such a claim is valid, ELEPHANT TALK may make modifications needed to cease the infringement. ELEPHANT TALK may inform T-Mobile on any of such modifications.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear and strong indemnification obligation for ELEPHANT TALK in cases of intellectual property infringement attributable to them, including a requirement to make necessary modifications. The modified version weakens this by removing 'in circumstances where the alleged infringement is attributable to ELEPHANT TALK and in no way the fault of T-Mobile or its Affiliated Company,' making the indemnification apply regardless of fault. It also replaces 'shall' with 'may' regarding modifications and informing T-Mobile. In the Netherlands, while indemnification clauses are generally enforceable, they are subject to reasonableness and fairness. By removing the fault attribution clause and weakening the obligations, the modified clause becomes potentially unfair to ELEPHANT TALK and could be challenged, as it obligates them to cover infringements even if T-Mobile contributed to the issue.",

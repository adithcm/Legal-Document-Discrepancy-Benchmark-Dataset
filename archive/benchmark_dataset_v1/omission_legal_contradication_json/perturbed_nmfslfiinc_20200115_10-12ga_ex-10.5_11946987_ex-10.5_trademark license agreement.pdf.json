                "original_text": "The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business and that it shall notify the Licensor of any action that must be taken by the Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with most laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business. The Licensee may, but is not required to, notify the Licensor of any action that must be taken by the Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "explanation": "By weakening the compliance obligation and removing the mandatory notification to the Licensor, this clause introduces a legal risk. Specifically, it suggests that compliance with all laws is not strictly required and removes the requirement for the licensee to inform the licensor of compliance actions. This omission could lead to violations of consumer protection laws, advertising standards, or other relevant regulations in the Territory (United States of America, Canada and the European Union), as the licensee might inadvertently or deliberately fail to adhere to specific legal mandates without informing the licensor, who also could be liable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various consumer protection laws and advertising regulations in the United States, Canada, and the European Union, which mandate strict compliance and may require specific disclosures or actions.",

                "original_text": "In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, the Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of its business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of the Licensor’s and the Licensee’s businesses as of the date of this Agreement. The Licensee further agrees to use the Licensed Mark in accordance with such quality standards as may be reasonably established by the Licensor and communicated to the Licensee from time to time in writing, or as may be agreed to by the Licensor and the Licensee from time to time in writing. The Licensee agrees to allow the Licensor to conduct reasonable inspection of the quality of the Licensee’s services from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "To generally maintain the Licensed Mark, the Licensee agrees to use minimal efforts to maintain the quality of its business and operation to what it deems fit. The Licensee agrees to use the Licensed Mark in accordance with what it reasonably considers quality standards, without need to adhere to standards established by the Licensor. The Licensee can deny the Licensor inspection of its services.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'reasonable efforts' to 'minimal efforts,' removing the requirement to meet the Licensor's quality standards, and allowing the Licensee to deny inspection, this significantly reduces the Licensor's control over the brand. This omission creates a legal contradiction with trademark laws, specifically concerning the duty of a licensor to maintain quality control over the use of their trademark by a licensee. Failure to maintain adequate quality control can lead to the abandonment of the trademark. This lack of control could result in the erosion of brand value and potential legal challenges regarding trademark protection.",

                "original_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor’s quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor’s quality standards, the Licensee may consider steps to address such issues.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirements for ‘any material respect’, a ‘commercially reasonable timeframe’ and setting a specific deadline of sixty days removes any serious obligation of the Licensee to cure noncompliance. It effectively negates any real commitment to address and resolve quality issues, thus diminishing the Licensor’s ability to enforce quality standards and protect its brand. This omission undermines the trademark owner's control over the brand's reputation. The licensee has no legal need to address complaints, potentially impacting the trademark and brand reputation.",

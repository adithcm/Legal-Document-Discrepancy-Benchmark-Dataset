                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the PRC, without regard to conflicts of law principles.",
                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be governed by contractual terms agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of the PRC. The modified clause removes this, implying that the agreement is only governed by the terms within the contract itself. This omission contradicts the PRC Contract Law, which mandates that all contracts must comply with national laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws and regulations related to fair competition. Removing the reference to PRC law creates a loophole where the agreement might bypass mandatory legal protections afforded under PRC law.",
                "contradicted_law": "PRC Contract Law (General Principles, Article 7: Parties shall abide by laws and administrative regulations when concluding and performing contracts; they shall not disrupt the social and economic order of the state and damage social public interests.)",

                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement represents the agreement between the parties, and may be modified at any time.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'complete, integrated, and entire' and 'except in writing signed by the parties' weakens the clause and its enforceability. Omitting the requirement for written consent for modifications directly contradicts contract law principles in the PRC (and most jurisdictions), which emphasize the importance of documented agreements and mutual consent for modifications to be valid. Without the written requirement, one party could claim modifications were made verbally, leading to disputes and potentially violating legal requirements for contract amendments. It creates a significant legal risk by allowing undocumented changes, potentially undermining the integrity of the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "PRC Contract Law Article 77: Any modification to a contract shall be subject to agreement between the parties. Where it is agreed by the parties that modification to a contract shall be in written form, it shall be in written form.",

                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'and their respective successors and assigns,' the agreement's enforceability is limited to only the original parties. This omission introduces a significant legal risk because it prevents the agreement from being automatically binding on any entities that might inherit the obligations or rights of the original parties (e.g., through mergers, acquisitions, or other forms of corporate restructuring). Under PRC law (specifically the Company Law and Contract Law), successors and assigns are typically bound by the contractual obligations of their predecessors unless explicitly stated otherwise. By omitting this clause, the agreement could be challenged if one of the original parties undergoes a change in its corporate structure, potentially undermining the intended termination and creating legal ambiguity regarding the ongoing rights and responsibilities related to the terminated Domain Name License Agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "PRC Contract Law, Article 91, item 4: The rights and obligations are terminated where the obligor assigns the contractual obligations to a third party, and the assignee accepts.",

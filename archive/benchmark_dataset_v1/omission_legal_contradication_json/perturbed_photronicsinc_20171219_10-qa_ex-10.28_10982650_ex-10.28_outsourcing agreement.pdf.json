                "original_text": "Each of the Suppliers warrants that the Products shall comply with the specifications and documentation agreed by the relevant Supplier and the Company in writing that is applicable to such Products for the Warranty Period. This warranty does not apply to any Product failures resulting from misuse, storage in or exposure to environmental conditions inconsistent with those specified in the applicable specifications or documentation, modification of the Product by anyone other than the relevant Supplier. If a Product fails to comply with the foregoing warranty, the relevant Supplier shall, at its option, either [***]such Product, or, in the event the foregoing options are not commercially practicable, [***]to the Company any amounts paid for the applicable Product. Without limiting the remedies specified in Article 8 and Section 9.2, this Section 6.1 states the exclusive remedy of the Company for failure of a Product to conform to the warranty provisions set forth in this Section 6.1.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'resulting from misuse, storage in or exposure to environmental conditions inconsistent with those specified in the applicable specifications or documentation, modification of the Product by anyone other than the relevant Supplier' limits the consumer rights related to warranty, where the consumer can't claim warranty if the product has any failures. The customer cannot claim for the product failing with its agreed specifications, which introduces legal risk. This omission weakens the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, potentially violating consumer protection laws in jurisdictions like Taiwan and China where these principles are recognized, albeit with some differences from US law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates consumer protection laws in Taiwan (ROC Consumer Protection Law) and the People's Republic of China (Consumer Rights Protection Law) by weakening warranty protections.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE' restricts what warranties can be available and the legal rights afforded. This clause attempts to disclaim implied warranties, which may be restricted or unenforceable under the laws of Connecticut, where Photronics, Inc. is based, as well as under the laws of Taiwan and China, where the other parties are based. By omitting specific mention of merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose, the contract introduces uncertainty regarding the suppliers' obligations, creating a potential legal contradiction with consumer protection regulations in multiple jurisdictions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as adopted in Connecticut (U.S.A.) regarding implied warranties, as well as similar consumer protection laws in Taiwan (ROC Consumer Protection Law) and the People's Republic of China (Consumer Rights Protection Law).",

The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the relevant Supplier, (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the relevant Supplier, or (iii) the fault of the Company.",

                "explanation": "The omission of '(including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the relevant Supplier)' severely limits the scope of indemnification. By removing the obligation to cover attorney fees and settlements, it places a disproportionate burden on the Company and creates an imbalance of power. The company must negotiate and approve its own settlement. It can be interpreted as attempting to circumvent legal standards regarding the recovery of legal costs and fair settlement practices in intellectual property and product liability disputes. This omission creates a legal risk by potentially violating principles of fairness and reasonable compensation as interpreted under the laws of Connecticut, Taiwan, and China.",

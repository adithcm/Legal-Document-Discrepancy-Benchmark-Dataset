The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period\ncommencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval\nof that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December\n31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a “Contract Period”).",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier may purchase an order volume of Units for each Contract Period. The specific quantity will be determined based on market conditions and mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the mandatory Minimum Annual Order Volume (MAOV). Many jurisdictions have implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in commercial contracts, but by removing the specific MAOV, Premier could potentially reduce their purchases significantly or even to zero without violating the contract, which could be argued as a bad faith attempt to undermine the agreement. In US contract law, particularly under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) which governs the sale of goods, contracts must have definiteness, and a lack of quantity term could be seen as unenforceable, or at least create significant ambiguity. Omitting the MAOV introduces legal risk concerning enforceability and potential claims of bad faith.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a clause that potentially overrides the original agreement. In contract law, generally the later agreement takes precedence, but this vaguely worded clause creates ambiguity. If the original agreement had clauses protecting one party, and this amendment weakens or contradicts those, it introduces uncertainty as to whether the original protections still hold. This is a legal contradiction because it makes it unclear which clauses of the original agreement are still legally binding, potentially undermining previously agreed upon protections or responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "Removing the MAOV and replacing it with nothing at all is a critical omission. The MAOV establishes a crucial obligation for Premier. By entirely deleting it, the contract lacks a key element regarding purchase volume, potentially rendering the agreement unenforceable due to a lack of definiteness. This creates a significant legal risk as Heritage has no guarantee of any revenue, and Premier could argue the contract is void due to lack of a material term. This goes against basic contract law principles requiring mutual obligation.",

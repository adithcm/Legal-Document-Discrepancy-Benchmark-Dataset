                "explanation": "This removes the consumer's right to continue using the application and toolbar for 24 months after termination, even if they agreed to an EULA granting them this right. This violates consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions, including the PRC, which require honoring pre-existing agreements unless there is a valid legal reason for termination. Consumers may expect continued access based on their initial agreement. It also creates a legal loophole where customers that purchased the service right before termination would be left without service, and with no refund.",

This omission means that after the contract ends, Skype or TOM Online could immediately create a competing product, using information and knowledge gained during the co-branding agreement.

By removing it, Online BVI, Tom Holding, and the Company are left financially vulnerable if the Skype software infringes on a third party's IP. This creates a legal risk and contradicts implied duties of care in contractual relationships, potentially violating obligations to provide a product that does not infringe intellectual property rights, under both UK and PRC law, where there is a standard expectation for indemnification in tech licensing agreements.",

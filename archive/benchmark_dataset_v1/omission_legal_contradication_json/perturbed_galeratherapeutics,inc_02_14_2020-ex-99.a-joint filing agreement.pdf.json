                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto. None of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit responsibility of each party for the completeness and accuracy of information concerning themselves, and removes the condition under which they *would* be responsible for information concerning other parties. This weakens the legal obligation to provide accurate information, which contradicts SEC regulations that mandate accurate and complete disclosures in filings under Section 13 of the Exchange Act. While the agreement still implies a degree of responsibility, removing the explicit statement and the 'reason to believe' clause creates a loophole.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related SEC regulations, specifically Rule 13d-1, which requires accurate and complete disclosure of beneficial ownership.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party,' the agreement now lacks a clear and legally sound mechanism for revocation. This could be interpreted to mean that a party can revoke their participation without formally notifying the other parties, potentially leading to confusion and disputes about the validity of joint filings. This creates uncertainty and contradicts the requirement for clear and transparent communication in legal agreements, particularly those related to securities filings. SEC requires clear disclosure and agreements, and this omission introduces ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and unambiguous terms, as well as SEC regulations emphasizing transparency and proper notification in securities filings.",

This weakens the enforceability and transparency of the agreement under securities law. The SEC requires clear reference to the applicable laws and regulations, and this omission makes it less clear whether the parties fully understand their obligations under the Exchange Act and introduces potential liability if the filing isn't compliant.",

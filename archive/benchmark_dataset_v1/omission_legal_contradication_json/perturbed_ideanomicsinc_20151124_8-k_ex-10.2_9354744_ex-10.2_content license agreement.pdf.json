The party seeking indemnification (the “Indemnified Party”) will give prompt notice to the indemnifying party (the “Indemnifying Party”) of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement; provided, however, that failure to give prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual material prejudice by such failure). The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate (at the Indemnifying Party’s expense) in the defense of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Section 13. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Party has been authorized by the Indemnifying Party; (ii) the Indemnified Party has been advised by its counsel in writing that there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of the action (in which case the Indemnifying Party will not have the right to direct the defense of the action on behalf of the Indemnified Party); or (iii) the Indemnifying Party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of the action within a reasonable time following receipt of the notice given pursuant to this Section 13, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party",

The party seeking indemnification will give notice to the indemnifying party of any claim for which indemnification is sought. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in any such action, but the fees and expenses of such participation will be at the expense of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party",
                "explanation": "The removal of the obligation to 'defend' and the phrase 'hold harmless' significantly reduces the scope of protection for the indemnified party. Removing 'Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, assigns, licensees and distributors' limits who can claim the protection. Deleting 'any and all judgments, settlements, damages, penalties, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees)' reduces the coverage to a vaguer \"damages and expenses.\" Furthermore, deleting the detailed provisions regarding the Indemnified Party's right to employ separate counsel and related cost allocation introduce a legal risk. Under New York law, parties have certain implied rights in indemnification contexts, but these are less defined than the original contractual specifications. The changes weaken the indemnitee's position and create ambiguity.",

Under New York law (Uniform Commercial Code § 2-314 and § 2-315), these implied warranties automatically apply to sales of goods unless explicitly disclaimed. By removing the specific language, the contract opens itself up to potential claims that these implied warranties were not effectively disclaimed, increasing legal risk, especially if the 'Titles' provided under the agreement are considered 'goods'.",

The modified clause omits these specifics. This creates legal risk because the original clause provided a clear framework, while the modified clause is vague.

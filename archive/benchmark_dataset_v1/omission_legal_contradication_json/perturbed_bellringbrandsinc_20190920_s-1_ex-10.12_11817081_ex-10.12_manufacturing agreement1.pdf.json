Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement and 21 C.F.R.

Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to compliance with all laws and regulations, including FDA and PHS guidelines, and replacing it with 'make reasonable efforts,' the contract weakens the guarantee of compliance with food safety standards. Also the removal of '21 C.F.R. Part 110 which is entitled “Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing or Holding Human Food” and as it may be amended from time-to-time' makes the contract non-compliant because this regulation sets the minimum requirements for food manufacturing, and weakening adherence to these standards introduces legal risk.",

At\nPremier’s option, Premier can direct Heritage to, and upon such direction Heritage shall, conduct such Recall Action (and Heritage shall ensure Jasper’s\ncooperation).

                "explanation": "Removing the specific obligations of Heritage regarding cooperation with recall actions, including the requirement to conduct the recall if directed by Premier and to ensure Jasper's cooperation, weakens Premier's ability to effectively manage a product recall. Also, omitting the line that says 'Any and all action to be taken in connection with a Recall Action shall be in accordance with FDA policies and other applicable laws and regulations' creates legal risk by potentially allowing the company to skirt legally mandated recall procedures.",

                "original_text": "Transporter shall provide Customer notice of any interruption or curtailment of the receipt of Customer Gas into the Transportation System as is reasonable under the circumstances.",
                "changed_text": "Transporter may, at its sole discretion, provide Customer notice of any interruption or curtailment of the receipt of Customer Gas into the Transportation System.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Transporter 'shall' provide notice of interruption or curtailment. By changing 'shall' to 'may, at its sole discretion', Transporter is no longer obligated to provide notice. This could violate requirements for fair business practices, especially considering Louisiana, the state the contract applies to, may have regulations about informing customers of service interruptions, especially in the context of natural gas transportation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Louisiana's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and potential violation of Louisiana Administrative Code Title 43, Part XIII, Chapter 3, Section 313 regarding notification of service disruptions.",

                "original_text": "Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter’s invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar Days’ of written notice from Transporter to Customer, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas without prejudice to any other available remedies at law or in equity.",
                "changed_text": "Within thirty (30) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter’s invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at a rate determined by Transporter. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken consumer protection by removing specifics about the payment method (wire transfer, account details), potentially allowing for less secure or transparent methods.  The omission of 'or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser' for interest calculation, combined with the replacement 'at a rate determined by Transporter' gives Transporter latitude to apply an excessive interest rate beyond what Texas or federal law may allow. Removal of 'and such failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar Days’ of written notice from Transporter to Customer'  removes a cure period before suspension of service, potentially violating due process or reasonable notice requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Texas usury laws (Texas Finance Code Chapter 302 and 303) regarding maximum interest rates and violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Texas law by removing the cure period.",

Exclusive venue for any suit, action or proceeding brought by either Party in connection with this Agreement or arising out of the terms or conditions hereof shall be in the state or federal courts situated in Harris County, Texas.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed, interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws determined at the Transporter's discretion. Venue for any suit, action or proceeding brought by either Party in connection with this Agreement or arising out of the terms or conditions hereof shall be determined at the Transporter's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change allows the Transporter to choose the governing law and venue, potentially selecting a jurisdiction unfavorable to the Customer. This eliminates Customer's rights to have disputes settled in a fair and predictable legal environment. Texas, like many states, has laws protecting against unfair venue and choice of law provisions, particularly when there's a significant power imbalance between parties. This could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Texas law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Texas Business and Commerce Code § 272.001 regarding unfair or deceptive trade practices and potential violation of Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 15.002 regarding mandatory venue provisions.",

Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general commercial and product liability insurance.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the NFLA / NFLA-NC and their authorized agents from expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs arising out of actions or omissions of Company, any advertising material furnished by Company, or any claim or action for personal injury, death, or other cause of action involving defects in Company’s Products or services. Company may provide commercial and product liability insurance at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'protect' significantly weakens the indemnity clause. Deleting 'any and all' before 'expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, including reasonable attorney’s fees' limits the scope of indemnification. Changing 'Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general commercial and product liability insurance' to 'Company may provide commercial and product liability insurance at its discretion' eliminates the mandatory insurance requirement, thereby increasing the NFLA's risk. The contract now fails to provide guaranteed protection via insurance which is a legal contradiction with standard endorsement contracts.",

Each party is entitled to depose one fact witness and all expert witnesses retained by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.",
                "changed_text": "All such arbitration shall take place at a location determined by the arbitrator. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding. ",
                "explanation": "The removal of the location constraint and the specific rights to depose witnesses limits discovery rights in the arbitration process. By deleting 'Each party is entitled to depose one fact witness and all expert witnesses retained by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate' and 'final, conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court', key legal protections for fair dispute resolution are omitted. This constitutes a legal contradiction because it curtails the standard due process rights typically afforded in arbitration under California law, potentially making the agreement substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Past due payments under this Agreement may bear interest. All amounts in this section are in United States dollars.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall bear interest at the rate of: (a) 1% per month; or (b) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less' to 'may bear interest', the obligation to pay interest on late payments is removed, creating a potential legal issue. California law sets a legal rate of interest (typically 10% per annum) that applies in the absence of a specified rate. Removing the 'shall' clause allows the company to not pay interest. This could be interpreted as a contradiction of implied legal standards for commercial transactions, specifically the lack of any guaranteed penalty for late payment.",

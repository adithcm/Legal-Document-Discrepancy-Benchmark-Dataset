                "original_text": "Distributor shall, at its own expense, maintain at a minimum general and product liability coverage in the Territory of at least US$2 million per occurrence, US$5 million in the aggregate. On a separate endorsement, Distributor shall name STAAR as an additional named insured. Such separate endorsement shall indicate that Distributor’s insurance is primary and that STAAR’s coverage as an additional named insured is not contributory. Each such insurance policy and endorsement shall provide that the insurance will not be canceled or reduces without at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to STAAR. On request, Distributor shall provide STAAR with copies or certificates of all such insurance policies.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall maintain general and product liability coverage in the Territory. Distributor shall name STAAR as an additional insured. Each such insurance policy shall provide that the insurance will not be canceled without prior written notice to STAAR.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'at a minimum,' the specific dollar amounts, the 'separate endorsement' clause, and the 'primary and non-contributory' language significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The deletion of the clause about reducing coverage eliminates an important protection for STAAR. The omission of the obligation to provide copies or certificates of all insurance policies eliminates STAAR's ability to verify compliance. This creates a legal contradiction with standard commercial lease insurance requirements in California, which mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for product liability.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires specific minimum insurance coverage amounts for commercial product liability based on the risk and scope of the business. Omitting these specifics leaves the contract vague and potentially non-compliant.",

The parties hereby expressly disclaim and exclude any applicable provisions of the United Nations Convention for the International Sales of Goods.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement, which is in English, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the disclaimer of the United Nations Convention for the International Sales of Goods (CISG) can have significant legal consequences. If the distributor is located in a country that has ratified the CISG, and the agreement involves the international sale of goods, the CISG may automatically apply. CISG provides different rules than California law regarding contract formation, the rights and obligations of buyers and sellers, and remedies for breach of contract. This omission could create uncertainty and legal disputes regarding which set of laws governs the transaction. This introduces legal risk by potentially subjecting the agreement to international law that may be less favorable to STAAR.",
                "contradicted_law": "The omission does not directly violate a law but creates a legal risk by potentially subjecting the agreement to the CISG if the distributor is located in a country that has ratified the CISG.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly preserves rights under local statutes that cannot be excluded, restricted, or modified, thus acknowledging mandatory consumer or distributor protection laws. Removing this 'without limiting any right distributor may have under local statutes that cannot be excluded, restricted or modified' clause implies that the limitation of liability applies even where local law might otherwise protect the distributor. This presents a legal contradiction because California law (and the laws of many other jurisdictions) prohibit the exclusion of certain implied warranties and limitations on liability in certain circumstances, especially those involving consumer goods or distribution agreements. Removing the exception exposes STAAR to potential liability if the limitation is deemed unenforceable under local law.",
                "contradicted_law": "California's Commercial Code and general contract law prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability in certain circumstances, especially regarding implied warranties and consumer rights. By removing the explicit acknowledgment of these rights, the clause becomes potentially unenforceable and legally risky.",

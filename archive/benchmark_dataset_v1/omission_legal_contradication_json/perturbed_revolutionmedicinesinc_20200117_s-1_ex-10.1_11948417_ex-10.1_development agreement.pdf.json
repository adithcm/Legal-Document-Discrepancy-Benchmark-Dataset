                "original_text": "Each Party shall procure and maintain insurance, including product liability insurance, with respect to its activities hereunder and under the Ancillary Agreements and which is consistent with normal business practices of companies similarly situated at all times during which any SHP2 Inhibitors or Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall procure and maintain insurance with respect to its activities hereunder and under the Ancillary Agreements.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'including product liability insurance' and 'which is consistent with normal business practices of companies similarly situated at all times during which any SHP2 Inhibitors or Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold' weakens the insurance requirement. This omission eliminates the explicit requirement for product liability insurance, and references to 'normal business practices', which creates a legal risk given the significant risk associated with pharmaceutical products.",

                "explanation": "Omitting crucial anti-corruption commitments weakens FCPA compliance. The removal of 'FCPA policy' suggests a weaker commitment, and the removal of anti-bribery and government affiliation clauses significantly lowers accountability. This raises legal risks, making the contract non-compliant with anti-bribery practices.",

                "explanation": "By removing the second part of the representation, it is omitting the warranty that it has not used any debarred individuals or entities in connection with the agreement.

                "explanation": "By removing the indemnification obligation for losses arising from 'Licensee’s Commercialization of the Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory,' the contract attempts to circumvent potential liability for harm caused to consumers due to the commercialization of the drug. This omission contradicts consumer protection laws and regulations in the United States that hold companies responsible for ensuring that their products are safe and properly marketed. Removing this clause puts consumers at risk, especially since it involves pharmaceuticals, where safety and proper usage are paramount.",

                "explanation": "The omission of clause (b), which requires the Indemnified Party to 'use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate any Losses,' removes a key obligation for loss mitigation. This creates a loophole where the indemnified party may not take appropriate steps to minimize damages, potentially increasing the financial burden on the indemnifying party and, by extension, impacting consumers if the losses are passed on through higher prices or reduced services. This is against the general principles of U.S. contract law and the duty to mitigate damages, which aims to prevent unnecessary losses.",

This is a contradiction of the legal principle that limitations of liability cannot shield a party from liability to the extent prohibited by applicable laws, especially in cases of gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or violations of consumer protection statutes. This would be especially risky for pharmaceuticals, as consumers harmed by unsafe or improperly marketed drugs may have limited recourse due to the blanket liability waiver.",

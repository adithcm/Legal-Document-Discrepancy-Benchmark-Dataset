Upon request, each Party shall provide the other Party a certificate of insurance as proof of insurance coverage.",

Upon request, each Party shall provide the other Party a certificate of insurance as proof of insurance coverage.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific liability limits for commercial general liability and workers compensation/employer’s liability insurance weakens the insurance requirements. Omitting the 'replacement cost basis' for property insurance reduces coverage adequacy, creating a **legal contradiction** with standard business practices and state regulations that recommend or require specific minimum coverage amounts to adequately protect against potential liabilities and property losses.",

                "explanation": "By removing the warranty disclaimer for 'MERCHANTABILITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT', the contract creates a **legal loophole** that contradicts the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).

By omitting specifics regarding financial instruments, the clause becomes vague.

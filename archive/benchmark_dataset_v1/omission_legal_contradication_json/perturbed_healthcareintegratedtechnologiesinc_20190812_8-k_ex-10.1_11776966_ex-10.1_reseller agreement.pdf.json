In the event no Returns Discount\nProgram has been entered into by the Parties, Supplier will not accept Returned Product.",
                "explanation": "By removing \"except for cases of Defective Products,\" the contract now implies that no returns are accepted, even for defective products. This contradicts consumer protection laws in many US states (and potentially other countries in the Territory), which mandate that consumers have the right to return or receive compensation for defective goods. This introduces legal risk because the contract is now less compliant with standard consumer protection legislation.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \", MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\", the contract attempts to disclaim the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. While disclaimers are possible, they must be conspicuous and often use specific language. In many US jurisdictions (governed by UCC), attempting to disclaim these warranties entirely or not doing so conspicuously can be challenged. This increases legal risk as it undermines consumer rights.",

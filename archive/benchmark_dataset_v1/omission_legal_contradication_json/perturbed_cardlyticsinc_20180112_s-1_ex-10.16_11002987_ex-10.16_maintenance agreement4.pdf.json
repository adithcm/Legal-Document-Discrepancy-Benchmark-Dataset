                "original_text": "Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement. Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled “Termination” of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without paying any reinstatement fee.",
                "changed_text": "Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement. Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services at any time. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America may reinstate the Maintenance Services subject to a reinstatement fee determined by Supplier.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the 'for convenience' clause, implying termination could be more restrictive, and eliminates the guarantee of reinstatement without a fee. This is a legal contradiction because many jurisdictions, including some states in the U.S. (where Bank of America operates), have implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. The removal of clear termination rights and introduction of a potentially arbitrary reinstatement fee could be seen as violating these covenants, making the contract less compliant.",

                "changed_text": "The Maintenance Period shall be determined by Supplier.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the guaranteed maintenance period of 24/7, including holidays. This contradicts the expected reasonable service uptime implicitly required for software maintenance agreements, especially those supporting critical banking operations. By removing the assurance of continuous maintenance, the contract becomes vague and could violate consumer protection laws that mandate clarity in service agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding clarity and reasonable expectations; potential violation of consumer protection laws requiring transparency.",

                "changed_text": "Supplier may provide training classes and installation support pursuant to a separate agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall provide' to 'may provide' and emphasizing a 'separate agreement', the obligation to provide training and installation support becomes discretionary. This is a legal contradiction, as software license agreements often implicitly include a reasonable level of training and support to ensure the software functions as intended. Eliminating this explicit obligation introduces legal risk by potentially violating implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, especially in the context of Bank of America's operations.",

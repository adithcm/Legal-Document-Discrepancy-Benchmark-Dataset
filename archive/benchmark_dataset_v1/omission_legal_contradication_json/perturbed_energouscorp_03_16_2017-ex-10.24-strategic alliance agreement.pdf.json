                "original_text": "Each party will maintain, during the Term and for three (3) years thereafter, such comprehensive general liability insurance (including without limitation, products liability) as will adequately protect it against its potential liabilities under this Agreement, in amounts customary in the semiconductor industry for similar services and products. Each party will, at the other party’s request, provide to the other party a certificate of insurance evidencing the foregoing insurance coverage.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'comprehensive,' the specific timeframe 'for three (3) years thereafter,' and 'amounts customary in the semiconductor industry' weakens the insurance requirement. Changing 'will' to 'may' in the certificate provision makes compliance optional, violating general principles that mandate insurance coverage to remain in place.",

The parties will refrain from exporting or re-exporting the Products or Product IP or any technical data or other materials received from each other, or the direct product of any of these, to any country, individual or organization proscribed by the United States government, unless properly authorized by the appropriate agencies of the United States government.

Each party agrees that it will not act in any fashion or take any action in violation of any applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation in any jurisdiction in which it does business, which prohibits the offering, giving or promising to offer or give, directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any official of a government, political party or instrumentality to assist it in obtaining or retaining business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any comparable legislation in another country.",

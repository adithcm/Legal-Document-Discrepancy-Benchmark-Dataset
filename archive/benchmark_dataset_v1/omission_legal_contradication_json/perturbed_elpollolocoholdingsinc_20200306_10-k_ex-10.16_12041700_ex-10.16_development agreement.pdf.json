                "original_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage for public liability, including products liability, in the amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage for public liability. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific 'One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit' requirement for public liability insurance creates a legal loophole. California law, where El Pollo Loco's headquarters are located, often mandates minimum liability coverage amounts for businesses, especially franchises. By deleting the stated amount, the contract may fall short of these requirements, exposing the franchisee to greater financial risk and potentially violating state regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law regarding minimum liability insurance coverage for businesses, including franchises. Specific statutes vary but generally require adequate coverage for potential liabilities.",

All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least thirty (30) days’ notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'shall be provided with certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage' and 'All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees' weakens Franchisor's ability to verify coverage and be directly compensated for losses due to the developer's negligence. This introduces legal risk, as without verifiable proof of insurance and a direct claim provision, Franchisor's recourse in case of an incident is significantly complicated, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law.",

                "original_text": "Developer shall defend immediately upon tender of defense, at its own cost, the Franchisor, its subsidiaries, parent and affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively for this section only known as “Franchisor”), from and against any and all claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitrations, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liens and damages (collectively for this section only known as “Losses”), however caused, and reimburse Franchisor for all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Franchisor in defense of any Losses, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising out of, or alleged to arise out of, or in connection with Developer’s activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any employee related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer resulting from the employee’s training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer’s failure for any reason to fully inform any third party of Developer’s lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any purpose. Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees that Developer’s duty to defend the Franchisor is separate from, independent of and free-standing of Developer’s duty to indemnify the Franchisor and applies whether the issue of Developer’s negligence, breach of contract, or other fault or obligation has been determined. Developer’s duty to defend is regardless of the outcome of liability even if Developer is ultimately found not negligent and not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues arising out of any claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitration, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liens or damages.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'any and all claims...however caused' to only claims resulting directly from 'Developer's gross negligence', the contract eliminates the developer's duty to defend the franchisor against claims arising from other potential causes (e.g., simple negligence, strict liability) or connected parties. California law favors broad indemnification clauses, but severely restricts indemnification for a party's own active negligence or willful misconduct. Limiting the defense obligation to 'gross negligence' only removes a mandated consumer protection relating to liabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Civil Code Section 2782, which restricts indemnity agreements from covering a party's own active negligence, but allows for indemnity in other cases. Also, it's limited when it comes to protection against claims.",

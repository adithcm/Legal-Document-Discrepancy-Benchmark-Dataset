                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase 'according to the provisions of the underlying share-it! Developer Agreement' grants element 5 sole discretion over refunds and returns. This omits the legally mandated consumer rights regarding refunds and returns, which are usually defined in the share-it! Developer Agreement and consumer protection laws. By omitting the reference, the contract becomes non-compliant, creating a legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the requirement to maintain the current version for viewing and announce any changes via email, element 5 eliminates the transparency and notification period for changes to the terms and conditions.

This creates ambiguity and potentially violates consumer protection laws if a consumer resides in a jurisdiction with stronger protections. Without a clear choice of law, a dispute could arise over which jurisdiction's laws apply, potentially denying the consumer rights they would have had under their local laws.",

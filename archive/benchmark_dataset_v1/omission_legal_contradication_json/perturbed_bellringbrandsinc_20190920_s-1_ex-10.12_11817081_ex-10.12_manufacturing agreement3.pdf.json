                "original_text": "All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered to Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A, which Schedule may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the “Specifications”), shall conform to Post Holding’s Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and shall conform in all material respects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates adherence to Post Holding's Quality Expectations Manual (Schedule E). Omitting this requirement weakens quality control standards. This introduces legal risk if the products fail to meet consumer safety standards mandated by state or federal law (e.g., FDA regulations for food products), as the manufacturer is no longer contractually obligated to adhere to a specific quality standard.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase 'identified in Schedule C', the contract no longer explicitly defines which ingredients and packaging materials Heritage is required to purchase. This creates ambiguity and removes the manufacturer's obligation to use specific, potentially regulated or approved, materials. This could lead to the use of substandard or non-compliant materials, violating consumer protection laws related to product safety and labeling (e.g., California Proposition 65 regarding toxic substances).",

                "changed_text": "Heritage shall charge Premier [***].",
                "explanation": "Removing the reference to 'Schedule C' regarding pricing terms introduces significant ambiguity. Schedule C presumably details the agreed-upon pricing structure and payment terms. By omitting this, the contract lacks a clearly defined pricing mechanism, creating an opportunity for disputes and potential overcharging. This could violate state-level consumer protection laws concerning fair pricing and transparency in commercial transactions.",

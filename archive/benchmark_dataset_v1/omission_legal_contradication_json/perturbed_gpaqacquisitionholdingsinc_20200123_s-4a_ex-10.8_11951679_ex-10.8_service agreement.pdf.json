                "original_text": "Constellation shall, at its own expense, secure and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term (a) insurance coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person’s right of publicity and right of privacy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] per occurrence; and (b) a general liability insurance policy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] in aggregate. The liability limits may be met with any combination of primary and excess or umbrella insurance policy limits. Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance, naming each HOF Entity as an additional insured, evidencing the existence of such insurance policies within ten (10) days after execution of this Agreement.",

Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance evidencing the existence of such insurance policies.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for specific insurance amounts and the A.M. Best rating, and also removes the timeframe for providing the insurance certificates. Ohio law mandates specific insurance coverage amounts and financial ratings for contractors working on commercial projects to ensure adequate protection against liabilities. The omission of these crucial details introduces legal risk and violates the consumer protection intended by these regulations.",

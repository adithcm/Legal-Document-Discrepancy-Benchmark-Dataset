Only products\n         which have been paid or credited to the account of the seller shall be\n         deemed sold. No royalties will be payable on the sales of any products\n         by any third-party distributors or licensees until such time as\n         accountings and payment or final credit therefor has been received by\n         the paying party. Either party, at its sole expense, upon at least\n         thirty (30) days written notice (and not more than once in respect of\n         any accounting period) will have the right to inspect the other party's\n         books regarding the obligations hereunder for a period of two (2) years\n         from the date on which any statement is rendered. Such auditing party\n         must make specific written objection within such two (2) year period.\n         Thereafter, it will be deemed to have consented to any such statements\n         or accountings which will then be considered an account stated as\n         between the parties, not subject to any objection for any reason\n         whatsoever. Provided the objecting party has made timely written\n         objection, as aforesaid, such party may file an action regarding same\n         within two (2) years and six (6) months after the applicable statement\n         is rendered, after which time any such action will be deemed barred.",
                "changed_text": "Accounting statements and, if applicable, royalty payments\n         for products sold will be rendered by each party at their discretion. Only products\n         which have been paid or credited to the account of the seller shall be\n         deemed sold.

The rendered statement will then be considered an account stated as between the parties, not subject to any objection for any reason whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "By removing the quarterly accounting requirement and the ability to audit the other party's books, the contract becomes less transparent and potentially allows one party to underreport royalties. Tennessee law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, including accurate accounting and royalty payments. This omission creates a legal risk as it could be argued that the modified clause violates this duty.",

Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the indemnifying party has right to access documents of the non-indemnifying party.",
                "explanation": "By limiting indemnification to 'direct' claims and granting the indemnifying party access to documents of the other party, the clause unfairly favors the indemnifying party.

                "explanation": "By allowing Time Life, Inc. to choose the governing law and requiring Integrity Incorporated to pay for arbitration, the agreement becomes heavily imbalanced.

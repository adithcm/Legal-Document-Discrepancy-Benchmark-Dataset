                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor will comply with all country, federal, state and local laws, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, policies and procedures, Including, without limitation, all anti-corruption laws, Including, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Applicable Laws). Distributor can find more information about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, or by contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will comply with country, state and local ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, policies and procedures.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit requirement for the distributor to comply with federal laws, including critical anti-corruption laws like the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. By omitting this, the contract weakens the distributor's obligation to adhere to these laws and reduces Cisco's protection against potential legal liabilities arising from the distributor's actions. The deletion of the reference to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act directly contradicts federal mandates for U.S. companies operating internationally to prevent bribery and corruption.",
                "contradicted_law": "U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act",

                "changed_text": "(d) Distributor will encourage its subcontractors, consultants, agents or representatives to be mindful of ethical considerations when interacting with government affiliated organizations.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the distributor's responsibility for ensuring compliance with anti-corruption laws by its subcontractors. The original text mandates 'appropriate and reasonable measures' to ensure compliance, whereas the modified version only requires encouragement of 'ethical considerations.' This removes a concrete legal obligation and replaces it with a vague suggestion, creating a loophole that reduces the distributor's accountability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This weakened language contradicts the intent and enforcement of the FCPA, which requires companies to implement robust compliance programs.",
                "contradicted_law": "U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act",
                "location": "Section 21.1(d)"

                "original_text": "(n) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Cisco may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if Distributor breaches any of the representations and warranties set forth in this section.",
                "changed_text": "(n) Cisco may consider terminating this Agreement if Distributor potentially disregards some of the representations and warranties set forth in this section.",
                "explanation": "This change transforms Cisco's right to terminate the agreement for breaches of anti-corruption representations and warranties into a discretionary option. The original 'may terminate immediately upon written notice' provides a strong enforcement mechanism for compliance with Section 21.1. The modified 'may consider terminating' weakens this significantly, removing a vital protection against corrupt practices. This omission of a clear enforcement mechanism creates a legal contradiction with the necessity for strict enforcement mechanisms in US anti-corruption compliance programs.",

                "changed_text": "Company shall comply with good business practices to the best of its ability.",
                "explanation": "By removing the mandatory compliance with 'all applicable laws and regulations' and replacing it with a weaker commitment to 'good business practices to the best of its ability,' the contract no longer explicitly requires the company to adhere to consumer protection laws, creating a legal loophole.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various consumer protection laws at the federal and state level (e.g., deceptive trade practices acts).",

                "explanation": "By adding 'subject to availability', this removes the guarantee of customer support. This can lead to violations of consumer protection laws that mandate reasonable customer support for products and services, especially for cybersecurity email software/telecom services, which are the Company Products.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'SHALL MAKE NO' to 'MAY MAKE', the reseller is now allowed to independently make claims about the product without prior consent. This introduces a significant risk of false advertising and misrepresentation, which violates consumer protection laws, including those governing advertising standards enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",

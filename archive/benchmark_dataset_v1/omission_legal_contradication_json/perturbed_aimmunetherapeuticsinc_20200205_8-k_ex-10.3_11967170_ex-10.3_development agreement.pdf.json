                "original_text": "Aimmune shall procure and maintain insurance, including clinical trials insurance and product liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations hereunder and which is consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated at all times during which the Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold by Aimmune pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that any such clinical trials insurance coverage shall, prior to the First Commercial Sale of a Product, in no event be less than [***] Dollars ($[***]) per loss occurrence, and product liability insurance coverage shall, after such First Commercial Sale, in no event be less than [***] Dollars ($[***]) per loss occurrence. It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of Aimmune’s liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written evidence of such insurance prior to commencement of this Agreement and upon expiration of any one coverage. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance which materially adversely affects the rights of Xencor hereunder.",

It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of Aimmune’s liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11. Aimmune may provide Xencor with written evidence of such insurance. Aimmune may provide Xencor with written notice prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific minimum insurance coverage amounts and requires Aimmune to provide Xencor with evidence of insurance and notice of any changes. The modified text removes the mandatory minimum coverage amounts, changes 'shall' to 'may' regarding proof and notice, and omits the timeframe for said actions. This significantly weakens Xencor's protection and ability to ensure Aimmune maintains adequate coverage, potentially violating standard business practices and increasing Xencor's financial risk.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifically mentions compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The modified text removes this specific mention. While still requiring compliance with all 'Applicable Laws', the omission of Anti-Corruption Laws weakens the explicit assurance and emphasis on preventing bribery and corruption. This increases the legal risk, as specific compliance with these laws is not clearly stated or guaranteed.",

The modified text weakens these obligations. Changing 'shall' to 'may' regarding access, removing mention of specific legal requirements and providing a ambiguous period for keeping records reduces protections of proprietary material, creating contradiction with intellectual protection rights.",

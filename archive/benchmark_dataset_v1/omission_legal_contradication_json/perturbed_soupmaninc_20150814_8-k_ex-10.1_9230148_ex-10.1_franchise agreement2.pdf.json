                "explanation": "By removing the waiver of notice of demand for payment or performance, the contract becomes ambiguous regarding the guarantor's right to receive notice before being held liable. Many jurisdictions require creditors to provide notice of default to guarantors, and removing this waiver could potentially violate those laws, creating legal risk for the franchisor if challenged. Under common law principles of guarantee, a guarantor is generally entitled to notice of the principal debtor's default unless such notice is expressly waived. Removing this express waiver subjects the franchisor to potential legal challenges based on lack of notice.",

                "explanation": "By removing the guarantor's waiver of personal jurisdiction and venue, the contract opens itself up to challenges regarding jurisdiction and venue. While forum selection clauses are generally enforceable, a clear and unambiguous waiver of jurisdiction and venue is crucial. Removing this waiver allows guarantors to argue that the chosen forum is inconvenient or lacks personal jurisdiction over them, increasing the franchisor's litigation costs and uncertainty. This contradicts the principle of upholding freely negotiated contractual terms regarding forum selection, potentially violating the state's laws related to contract enforcement and jurisdiction.",

                "changed_text": "Guarantors shall guarantee performance by Master Franchisee of the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Removing the word 'unconditionally' weakens the guarantee. An unconditional guarantee means the guarantor's obligation is primary and independent of the Master Franchisee's obligations. Removing 'unconditionally' allows the guarantor to argue defenses based on the Master Franchisee's actions or inactions, potentially shielding them from liability. This introduces legal risk by creating ambiguity about the nature of the guarantee and making it more difficult for the Franchisor to enforce. Many jurisdictions interpret guarantees strictly, and an ambiguous guarantee is more likely to be construed against the drafter (the Franchisor).",
                "contradicted_law": "Principles of contract law and suretyship law regarding the interpretation of guarantees and the distinction between conditional and unconditional guarantees.",

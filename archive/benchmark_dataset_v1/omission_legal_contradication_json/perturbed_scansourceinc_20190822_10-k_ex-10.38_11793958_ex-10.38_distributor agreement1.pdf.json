Such insurance shall (a) provide for contractual liability coverage, (b) provide for cross liability coverage, and (c) name the other party and its subcontractors, as well as the directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns of all of them, as additional insureds, but only to the extent of liabilities falling within the indemnity obligations of the other party pursuant to the terms of Section 24 in this Agreement.",

Such insurance shall (a) provide for contractual liability coverage, (b) provide for cross liability coverage, and (c) name the other party and its subcontractors, as well as the directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns of all of them, as additional insureds, but only to the extent of liabilities falling within the indemnity obligations of the other party pursuant to the terms of Section 24 in this Agreement.",

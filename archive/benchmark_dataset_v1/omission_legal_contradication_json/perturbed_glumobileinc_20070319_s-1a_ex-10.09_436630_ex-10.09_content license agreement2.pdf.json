This release does not extend to claims for gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the exclusion for claims of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the contract attempts to release claims that are often legally protected from release, especially concerning consumer rights and product safety. This introduces a legal risk as it may violate consumer protection laws that prevent companies from avoiding liability for egregious misconduct.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law and consumer protection laws that limit the enforceability of releases covering gross negligence or willful misconduct. Specific state laws vary, but many states disallow waivers of liability for such conduct.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase 'for which Fox shall retain a Distribution Fee as defined in Paragraph 4(a) of this Amendment', the contract becomes ambiguous regarding the fees associated with direct-to-consumer distribution. This creates a potential legal contradiction, as consumer protection laws often require clear and conspicuous disclosure of all fees and charges associated with a product or service. Omitting this key detail could be construed as deceptive or misleading.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various consumer protection laws, including the Federal Trade Commission Act and state-level unfair trade practices acts, which prohibit deceptive or misleading business practices.",

This omission creates legal risk because it could lead to copyright or right of publicity claims if Glu Mobile uses her image without proper authorization, violating intellectual property laws and potentially consumer protection laws related to false endorsement.",

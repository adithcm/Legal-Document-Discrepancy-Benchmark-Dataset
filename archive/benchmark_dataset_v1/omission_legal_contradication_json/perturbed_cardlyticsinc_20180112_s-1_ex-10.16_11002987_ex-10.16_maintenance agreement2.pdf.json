                "changed_text": "If the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may terminate this Schedule.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder' eliminates Bank of America's right to a refund if the price increases and they terminate the schedule. This contradicts general contract law principles which often require restitution when a contract is terminated due to a material breach or a significant change in terms by one party, potentially leaving Bank of America without recourse for funds already spent.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'or exceed' and 'all of the... performance and other specifications described in the Program Materials and the documents prepared either by Bank of America', the clause significantly weakens the performance standards required of the Supplier's customizations. If Bank of America requires specific performance metrics or other specifications and these are not explicitly included and guaranteed, Bank of America may face legal challenges in enforcing those unwritten expectations. This violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing present in most jurisdictions.",

                "explanation": "By changing the text, the supplier has the sole choice to change any conditions of the environment for the customization. This could potentially allow a product that is not suitable for use by Bank of America, due to the change in environment. This violates standard business practices and possibly some contract law principles.",

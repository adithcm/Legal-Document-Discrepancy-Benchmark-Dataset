                "original_text": "The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall (i) be substantially the same as or greater than the quality of goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date and (ii) not be associated with any goods or services, including any activities, that are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on (A) the image or reputation of any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks or (B) Seller’s right, title or interest in and to, any of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall not be associated with any activities that are likely to affect the Seller’s right, title or interest in and to, any of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause requiring the company to ensure its goods and services are of the same or greater quality as those provided before the agreement weakens consumer protection. Trademark law, particularly the Lanham Act in the US, requires trademark owners to maintain quality control over licensed trademarks to prevent consumer deception. By omitting the quality control clause, the contract creates a risk that the licensee could provide substandard goods or services, thereby tarnishing the trademark's reputation and potentially misleading consumers. The modified text also omits the clause that prevents the company from doing anything that could damage the reputation of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, further impacting consumer rights.",

                "original_text": "In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.3, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall comply with all obligations applicable to Arizona and its Affiliates under the Trademark License Agreement including, for the avoidance of doubt, any obligations with respect to reporting Complaints (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), which reports the Company shall provide to Arizona, and quality control and standards, and Licensor Competitors (as defined in the Trademark License Agreement), and neither Party shall undertake any act that would constitute a breach or a basis for termination under the Trademark License Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall endeavor to comply with obligations applicable to Arizona and its Affiliates under the Trademark License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Deleting the specific requirements for the Company to report complaints, adhere to quality control standards, and avoid actions that breach the Trademark License Agreement weakens the enforcement of consumer protection measures tied to licensed trademarks. This omission introduces a legal risk because it relaxes the licensee’s responsibility to maintain the standards required by the original licensor, potentially leading to consumer deception or dissatisfaction. By replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply', the obligation is weakened and therefore increases legal risk.",

                "original_text": "Each Party hereto acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by such Party and that any such breach would cause Arizona, on the one hand, and the Buyer Entities, on the other hand, irreparable harm. Accordingly, each Party hereto also agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by such Party, Arizona, on the one hand, and the Buyer Entities, on the other hand, shall be entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific performance. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Arizona, on the one hand, and Buyer Entities, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides for specific performance and equitable relief without the need for a bond. The modified text removes the acknowledgment of irreparable harm, eliminates the waiver of objections to specific performance, and weakens the assurance of equitable relief. By changing 'shall be entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of posting a bond' to 'shall be entitled to seek equitable relief', the provision becomes weaker and less certain. This introduces legal risk because it lessens the ability of a party to quickly and effectively enforce the agreement, potentially harming consumers who rely on the agreement's provisions. Consumers rely on the enforcement of trademark standards to ensure the quality and consistency of products and services.",

Such insurance (a) shall be primary insurance with respect to each Party’s own participation under this\nAgreement, (b) shall be issued by a recognized insurer rated by A.M. Best “A-VII” (or its equivalent) or better, or an insurer pre-\napproved in writing by the other Party, and (c) shall list the other Party as an additional insured under the General Liability Policy.",

Such insurance (a) shall be primary insurance with respect to each Party’s own participation under this\nAgreement and (c) may list the other Party as an additional insured under the General Liability Policy.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clauses specifying the minimum insurance requirements and the insurer's rating, the contract omits essential details, creating a legal loophole. Specifically, the removal of subsection (b) eliminates the requirement for the insurer to be rated 'A-VII' or better by A.M. Best, which contradicts standard risk management practices and potentially violates implied obligations to secure adequate coverage. Also, insurance being primary should be a must, not a may.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause that insurance policies 'shall' be under an occurrence form weakens the contract. The phrase 'may provide' is not mandatory; the other party has no guarantee of being given the certificates. An 'occurrence form' is a claims-made form that provides coverage.

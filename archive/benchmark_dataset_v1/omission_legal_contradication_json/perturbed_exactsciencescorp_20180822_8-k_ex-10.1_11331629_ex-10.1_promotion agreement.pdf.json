                "original_text": "Each Party agrees to obtain and maintain, during the Term and for five (5) years after the Term, commercial general liability insurance, including products liability insurance, with minimum “A-” AM Best rated insurance carriers, in each case with limits of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence and in the aggregate. All deductibles/retentions will be the responsibility of the named insured. Pfizer and its Affiliates will be an additional insured on Exact’s commercial general liability and products liability policies, and be provided with a waiver of subrogation. To the extent of its culpability, all coverages of Exact will be primary and non-contributing with any similar insurance carried by Pfizer. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.2 to the contrary, Pfizer may meet its obligations under this Section 6.2 through self-insurance.",

All deductibles/retentions will be the responsibility of the named insured. Pfizer may meet its obligations under this Section 6.2 through self-insurance.",
                "explanation": "The removal of requirements for 'minimum “A-” AM Best rated insurance carriers', 'limits of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence and in the aggregate', 'Pfizer and its Affiliates will be an additional insured on Exact’s commercial general liability and products liability policies, and be provided with a waiver of subrogation', and 'To the extent of its culpability, all coverages of Exact will be primary and non-contributing with any similar insurance carried by Pfizer', creates a **legal contradiction** with standard business practices and possibly state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts and financial ratings for liability insurance to protect consumers and businesses.",

                "original_text": "In the event any payments made pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the laws or regulation of any jurisdiction, the Party making such payment shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of the payee to the extent required by Applicable Law and such amounts payable to the payee shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under Applicable Law to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, the payee. To the extent that the Party making a payment is required to deduct and withhold taxes on any payments under this Agreement, the Party making such payment shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and promptly transmit to the payee an official tax certificate or other evidence of such withholding sufficient to enable the payee to claim such payments of taxes.",

Any such withholding taxes required may be an expense of, and borne solely by, the payee.",
                "explanation": "Removing the obligations to do so 'to the extent required by Applicable Law', pay taxes to the proper authority 'in a timely manner', and provide evidence of withholding significantly reduces transparency and compliance with tax laws. This introduces a **legal contradiction** by failing to fully adhere to tax regulations, increasing the risk of tax evasion or non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "Removing the mandated provision of a weekly report with specific details, and changing 'shall' to 'may', reduces transparency and Pfizer's ability to monitor the effectiveness of the promotion. This creates a **legal contradiction** because the absence of mandatory reporting can impede the detection of potential fraud, waste, or abuse related to healthcare services, going against regulations that promote healthcare transparency.",

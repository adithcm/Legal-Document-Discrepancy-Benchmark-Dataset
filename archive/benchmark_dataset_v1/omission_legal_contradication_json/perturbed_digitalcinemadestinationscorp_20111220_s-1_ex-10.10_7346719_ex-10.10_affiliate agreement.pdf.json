NCM shall maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance for its business and Equipment in such amounts and against such perils as NCM deems adequate for its business, including the installation services set forth in Section 2.2 herein. Each Party will name the other Party (including its agents, officers, directors, employees and affiliates) as an additional insured on such policies of insurance.",
                "changed_text": "Network Affiliate shall maintain insurance on the Theatres and the Equipment. NCM shall maintain insurance for its business and Equipment, including the installation services set forth in Section 2.2 herein.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement that both parties maintain insurance with 'financially sound and reputable insurance companies' and the critical clause where 'Each Party will name the other Party (including its agents, officers, directors, employees and affiliates) as an additional insured on such policies of insurance.' This omission weakens the protection for both parties, failing to ensure adequate coverage and potentially violating standard business practice and potentially state-specific insurance requirements for commercial entities, such as those in Delaware where both entities are incorporated.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Delaware corporate law and general business insurance standards requiring adequate and reputable insurance coverage. State-specific insurance regulations may also apply depending on the location of the theaters.",

Any recoveries, damages and costs recovered through such proceedings, suits, or hearings shall belong exclusively to NCM.' eliminates NCM's obligation to address infringements and allocates all financial benefits solely to them, this omission introduces a **legal contradiction** with standard intellectual property enforcement practices, creating a legal risk where Network Affiliate has no control over its brand protection and no financial remedy if NCM opts not to defend it. This could violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

By softening the language to 'may be entitled to payment,' it creates uncertainty and a weaker guarantee, it could potentially be a **legal contradiction** in jurisdictions where attorney fees are mandated by statute in certain contract disputes. Also, since Delaware law will apply.",

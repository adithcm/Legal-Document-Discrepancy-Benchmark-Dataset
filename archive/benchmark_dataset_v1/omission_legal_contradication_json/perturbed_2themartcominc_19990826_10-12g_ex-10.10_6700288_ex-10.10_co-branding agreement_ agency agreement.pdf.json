Should any of the terms, conditions or\nprovisions of this Agreement conflict with the California\nEscrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern\ni-Escrow's business practices, the California\nEscrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes\nsuch a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart\nwritten notice of such conflict and the parties\nwill use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states compliance with California Escrow Law and dictates that this law prevails in case of conflict. The modified clause removes the explicit reference to California Escrow Law, replacing it with a weaker commitment to 'reasonable efforts' and removing the provision that California Escrow Law shall prevail. This creates a legal loophole, potentially allowing i-Escrow to operate in a manner that doesn't fully adhere to the mandatory requirements of California Escrow Law, thereby omitting a legally mandated consumer protection.",

Removing 'any and all' and 'including reasonable attorneys' fees' limits the scope of indemnity, potentially violating California law which mandates comprehensive indemnity in certain commercial contracts.

While parties can limit liability, removing the explicit exclusion of liability for damages arising from negligence creates ambiguity. California law generally disallows limiting liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct. By omitting 'including negligence', the contract could be interpreted to attempt to limit liability even for acts of simple negligence, which could be deemed unconscionable and violate public policy.",

                "original_text": "3.09 Company represents that to the best of its knowledge, the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, will be free from claims of infringement of the patents and copyrights of any Third Party. Company further represents that it has not received any written notice of a claim and otherwise has no knowledge that the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, violate or infringe upon the rights of any Person. Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Investor, Investors’ Affiliates, and their officers and directors, and their direct and indirect customers, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, diminution in value, deficiencies, actions, proceedings, taxes, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of investigation as incurred, arising out of or relating to any breach of any of the representations made in this Article 3.09.",
                "changed_text": "3.09 Company represents that it has not received any written notice of a claim and otherwise has no knowledge that the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, violate or infringe upon the rights of any Person. Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Investor, Investors’ Affiliates, and their officers and directors from and against any losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, and expenses arising out of or relating to any breach of any of the representations made in this Article 3.09.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the representation regarding non-infringement of third-party patents and copyrights and the restriction of the indemnity clause introduces significant legal risk. The exclusion of 'diminution in value, deficiencies, actions, proceedings, taxes, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of investigation as incurred' from the indemnity significantly weakens the investor's protection against potential damages, exposing the investor to greater financial risk in case of intellectual property disputes. This is particularly problematic under New York law, which governs the contract (Article 13.00), as it mandates good faith and fair dealing, including reasonable protection against foreseeable losses arising from misrepresentation or breach of contract.",

COMPANY WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO INVESTOR OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF ANY INJURY, LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, SUSTAINED BY, OR ANY DAMAGES ASSESSED OR ASSERTED AGAINST, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY INCURRED BY OR IMPOSED ON INVESTOR OR ANY OTHER PERSON, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR RESULTING FROM: (A) THE PRODUCTION, USE OR SALE OF ANY APPARATUS OR PRODUCT OR METHOD, OR THE PRACTICE OF THE PATENTS BY INVESTOR OR ITS ASSIGNS; (B) THE USE BY INVESTOR OR ITS ASSIGNS OF ANY TECHNICAL INFORMATION, TECHNIQUES, OR PRACTICES DISCLOSED BY COMPANY; OR (C) ANY ADVERTISING OR OTHER PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES BY INVESTOR OR ITS ASSIGNS WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING, AND INVESTOR WILL HOLD COMPANY, AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, HARMLESS IN THE EVENT COMPANY, OR ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS, IS HELD LIABLE.",

                "explanation": "By eliminating the phrase \"SUBJECT TO AND EXCEPT FOR ANY INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 3.09 ABOVE\" and severely restricting the scope of liability to only losses or damages sustained *directly* by the investor, this modification creates a significant legal loophole. It removes the Company's warranty of accuracy or safety of technical information and limits liability for damages. This change directly contradicts standard practices in intellectual property agreements, which typically include warranties and appropriate liability clauses to protect the licensee (Investor). Given that the agreement is governed by New York law (Article 13.00), this alteration would expose the investor to substantial risk if the technical information provided by the Company is inaccurate or leads to damages.",

                "explanation": "By granting the Company the unilateral power to determine the construction, validity, enforcement, and interpretation of the IP Agreement, this change effectively eliminates the concept of impartial legal interpretation. This violates fundamental principles of contract law, as it prevents the Investor from seeking independent legal recourse and undermines the enforceability of the agreement. Under New York law, contracts are interpreted based on the objective intent of the parties and principles of fairness. This alteration renders the agreement unconscionable and potentially unenforceable, as it creates a situation where one party can arbitrarily define the terms of the contract to their advantage.",

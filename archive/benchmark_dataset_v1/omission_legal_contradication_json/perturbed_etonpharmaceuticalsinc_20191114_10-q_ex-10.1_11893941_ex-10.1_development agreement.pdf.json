                "original_text": "At all times from the first commercial sale of any Product(s) or after the Effective Date through the date which is five (5) years after the final sale of such Product(s), the Parties will maintain general liability insurance in amounts that are reasonable and customary in the pharmaceutical industry, provided in no event shall the general liability insurance amounts be less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence and ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in the aggregate limit of liability per year. The Parties shall provide written proof of such insurance to each other upon request.",
                "changed_text": "At all times from the first commercial sale of any Product(s) or after the Effective Date through the date which is five (5) years after the final sale of such Product(s), the Parties may maintain general liability insurance in amounts they deem appropriate. The Parties may provide written proof of such insurance to each other upon request.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'will' and replacing it with 'may' makes the insurance obligation optional. Removing the minimum insurance amounts creates a legal risk because it contradicts typical requirements for liability coverage in pharmaceutical agreements, especially if state laws mandate minimum coverage for potential liabilities related to product development, manufacturing, or sales.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state laws regarding minimum liability insurance coverage for businesses, particularly those dealing with pharmaceuticals where product liability risks are significant.",

                "changed_text": "ETON may, at its discretion, choose to Market the Products in the Territory during the Term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens ETON's obligation to market the products. By replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'may, at its discretion, choose to market', the contract no longer mandates a specific level of effort. This could be seen as an omission of a required level of commitment, and could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under contract law, especially in Delaware where the contract is governed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, a principle of contract law in Delaware.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall be responsible for and shall pay all Taxes payable on any income earned or received by it during the Term. Where required by law, ETON shall have the right to withhold applicable Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder by ETON to Aucta. Any Tax, duty or other levy paid or required to be withheld by ETON on account of any payments payable to Aucta under this Agreement shall be deducted from the amount of payments due to Aucta. ETON shall secure and promptly send to Aucta proof of such Taxes, duties or other levies withheld and paid by ETON for the benefit of Aucta.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall be responsible for Taxes payable on any income earned or received by it during the Term. ETON may withhold Taxes from payments to Aucta. Any Tax or duty withheld by ETON on payments to Aucta shall be deducted from payments due. ETON is not obligated to provide proof of Taxes withheld.",
                "explanation": "Removing the obligation for ETON to provide proof of withheld taxes to Aucta creates a transparency issue and potential legal risk. In the U.S., companies are generally required to provide documentation (e.g., Form 1042-S) to recipients of payments from which taxes have been withheld. By removing this obligation, the contract could be interpreted as violating tax regulations or creating an environment where Aucta cannot properly account for taxes paid on its behalf. It also weakens Aucta's ability to claim tax credits in their jurisdiction, which could be considered a violation of fair practice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates IRS regulations regarding providing documentation of tax withholdings (e.g., Form 1042-S) and creates potential issues with transparency and fair practice.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the part about 'Each party irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Illinois and the federal courts situated in the State of Illinois', we're removing the explicit agreement to jurisdiction. While the default jurisdiction might still be Illinois based on other factors, the lack of explicit consent could allow a party to argue for a different venue, potentially violating legal expectations and increasing litigation costs.

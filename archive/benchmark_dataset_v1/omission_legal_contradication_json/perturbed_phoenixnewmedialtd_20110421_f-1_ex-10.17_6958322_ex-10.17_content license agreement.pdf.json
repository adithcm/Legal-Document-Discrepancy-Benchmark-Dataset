                "explanation": "This change removes the governing law as PRC Law (People's Republic of China Law) and replaces it with a vague reference to commercial agreements common practices. This creates a legal contradiction because contracts operating within China are required to adhere to PRC Law, especially concerning consumer rights and intellectual property. Omitting this makes the contract non-compliant and introduces legal risk.",

                "explanation": "This revision removes 'reasonable expenses incurred in resolving such dispute (including reasonable attorney fees)' from the indemnification clause. In many jurisdictions, including China, the losing party in a legal dispute is often required to cover the prevailing party's legal expenses. By omitting this, the contract attempts to limit Party B's liability in a way that may contradict standard legal practice and potentially shift undue financial burden onto Party A.",

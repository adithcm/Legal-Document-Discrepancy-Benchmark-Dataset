                "changed_text": "The Venture may, at the discretion of the Managers, insure its assets against loss.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for insurance 'where reasonable and standard practice in the industry' and replacing it with discretionary insurance coverage weakens the Venture's obligation to protect its assets. Florida law requires businesses to maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect against foreseeable risks, especially in IT Development and medical service deployment which can be very risky. This change introduces a loophole where the Managers can choose not to insure assets, potentially violating state regulations regarding business liability and asset protection.",

                "changed_text": "Each Member may be indemnified by the Venture from harm or damages relating to Venture affairs.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'and held harmless by the Venture from any and all harm or damages of any nature' and the exception for 'gross negligence or willful misconduct' significantly weakens the indemnification clause. Florida law imposes a duty of care and responsibility on business ventures. Providing indemnification even in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct violates this legal principle and creates potential legal risk by enabling or shielding irresponsible behavior.",

If the dispute is not resolved within a reasonable period then any or all outstanding issues may be submitted to mediation in accordance with any statutory rules of mediation. If mediation is not successful in resolving the entire dispute or is unavailable, any outstanding issues will be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. The arbitrator’s award will be final, and judgment may be entered upon it by any court having jurisdiction within the State of Florida.",
                "changed_text": "In the event a dispute arises out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Members may attempt to resolve the dispute through direct negotiation.",
                "explanation": "By removing the mandatory mediation and arbitration clauses, the contract eliminates a consumer's right to a potentially faster and cheaper resolution process than going straight to court. Florida Statutes mandate that certain disputes go through mediation or arbitration before court proceedings. The deletion of any requirements for mediation or arbitration introduces the risk of violating these statutes. Especially if the members of the venture are considered as service providers to the public (medical service).",

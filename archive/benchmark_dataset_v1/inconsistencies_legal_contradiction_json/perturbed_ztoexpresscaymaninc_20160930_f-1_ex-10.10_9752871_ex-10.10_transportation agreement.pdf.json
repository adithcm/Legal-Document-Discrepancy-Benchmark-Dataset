                "original_text": "In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the standard rate of RMB200 per parcel, and indemnify the actual price for high-end insured parcel (or indemnify by the value of the parcel provided by arbitration department determined by Party A).",
                "changed_text": "In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the fixed rate of RMB5 per parcel, regardless of the actual value, and no additional indemnity will be provided for high-end insured parcels.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts consumer protection laws, which typically require compensation to be proportional to the actual value of the damaged goods. Setting a fixed, low indemnity rate regardless of the parcel's value is likely to be deemed unfair and unenforceable, especially for insured high-value parcels. It creates a legal inconsistency where the contractual compensation significantly deviates from legally mandated fair compensation.",

                "original_text": "Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B’s vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB500 per trip on the first working day, RMB1,000 per trip on the second working day and RMB2,000 per trip on the third working day (based on the time records on the parcel transfer documents) and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month’s freight.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of parcel transfer due to Party B’s vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the rate of RMB10,000 per trip, regardless of the length of the delay or any extenuating circumstances, and such liquidated damages will be deducted immediately.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by imposing excessively high liquidated damages. Chinese contract law prohibits unreasonably high liquidated damages. A fixed penalty of RMB10,000 per trip, without considering the actual loss suffered by Party A due to the delay, is likely to be considered punitive rather than compensatory and thus unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Party B shall never terminate the Agreement under any circumstances. If Party B attempts to terminate the Agreement, Party B will immediately forfeit all assets and be permanently blacklisted from the industry.",
                "explanation": "This contradicts labor and contract laws by denying Party B the right to terminate the contract, even under reasonable circumstances. The penalty of forfeiting all assets is also grossly disproportionate and likely unenforceable. Chinese law protects the right to terminate contracts under specific conditions and prohibits excessive penalties. Additionally, forcing permanent blacklisting could violate fair competition and labor laws.",

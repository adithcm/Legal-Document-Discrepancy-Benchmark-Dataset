                "changed_text": "2.3 NeuroBo shall, at its costs and expenses, deliver the API to the place designated by Dong-A no later than 1 day prior to the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in accordance with the Firm Order.",
                "explanation": "The modification requires NeuroBo to deliver API only 1 day before the requested delivery date. This is an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially violating reasonable commercial practice and good faith dealing, effectively sabotaging NeuroBo's ability to meet its obligations under the contract. It contradicts the implicit requirement of providing sufficient lead time for manufacturing, which is standard in supply agreements.",

                "explanation": "The modification reduces the time for NeuroBo to perform quality control tests to 1 day. This is an unreasonably short timeframe for comprehensive quality control testing, especially for pharmaceuticals. It is contradictory to ensure reasonable time for performing quality test.",

                "original_text": "If an event of Force Majeure occurs, a Party's obligations under this Contract affected by such an event shall be suspended during the period of delay caused by the Force Majeure and shall be automatically extended, without penalty, for a period equal to such suspension. The Party claiming Force Majeure shall promptly inform the other Party in writing and shall furnish within fifteen (15) days thereafter sufficient evidence of the occurrence and duration of such Force Majeure.",
                "changed_text": "If an event of Force Majeure occurs, a Party's obligations under this Contract affected by such an event shall be suspended during the period of delay caused by the Force Majeure. The Party claiming Force Majeure shall inform the other Party in writing when practical and shall furnish evidence of the occurrence and duration of such Force Majeure within 6 months.",
                "explanation": "In the changed text, the original requirement to furnish sufficient evidence within fifteen (15) days has been changed to six (6) months and the obligation to inform the other party promptly has been weakened to \"when practical\". This is a legal contradiction because, under PRC law, parties are expected to act in good faith and provide timely notification of force majeure events, especially when these events impact contractual obligations. Delaying notification and evidence submission can be seen as a failure to mitigate damages and could invalidate the force majeure claim.",

                "changed_text": "Each of the Parties and the Joint Venture Company receiving all such information as aforesaid (hereinafter referred to \"Confidential Information\") shall, during the Contract Term, or during the term of the Joint Venture Company and for one (1) year after the early termination or dissolution of the Joint Venture Company:\no maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information;\no not disclose it to any person or entity, except to their respective employees who need to know such Confidential Information to perform their work responsibilities.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one (1) year after termination of the joint venture could be seen as insufficient to protect proprietary technology and trade secrets, especially considering the long-term nature of the joint venture and the potential for reverse engineering or misuse of the technology by the Chinese party after termination. This creates a legal risk, as PRC law, including the Anti-Unfair Competition Law, provides for longer protection periods for trade secrets under certain circumstances.",

                "explanation": "Changing the firm 'promptly' to 'at their earliest convenience', and setting 'fifteen (15) days' evidence furnishing to 'when available' significantly weakens the obligation. Chinese contract law emphasizes good faith and reasonable efforts in mitigating damages from unforeseen events. By weakening these notification and evidence requirements, the modified clause contradicts these principles and could be deemed unenforceable or a breach of contract under PRC law.",

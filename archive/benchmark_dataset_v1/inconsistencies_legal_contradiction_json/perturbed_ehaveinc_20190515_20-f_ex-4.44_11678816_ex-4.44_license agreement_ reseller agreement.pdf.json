                "original_text": "CHT will provide Ehave and its representatives, auditors and inspectors (\"Auditors\") upon ten (10) Business Days prior written notice with reasonable access, during business hours, to all facilities, systems and assets used by CHT, to CHT personnel and subcontractors and to all relevant CHT books and records, in each case, to the extent relevant to this Agreement, in order to conduct appropriate audits, examinations and inspections (\"Audits\") to:\n(i)\nverify compliance with the requirements set out in this Agreement; and\n(ii)\nverify the Royalty calculations.",
                "changed_text": "CHT will provide Ehave and its representatives, auditors and inspectors (\"Auditors\") upon one (1) Business Day prior written notice with reasonable access, during business hours, to all facilities, systems and assets used by CHT, to CHT personnel and subcontractors and to all relevant CHT books and records, in each case, to the extent relevant to this Agreement, in order to conduct appropriate audits, examinations and inspections (\"Audits\") to:\n(i)\nverify compliance with the requirements set out in this Agreement; and\n(ii)\nverify the Royalty calculations.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the audit notice period from ten business days to one business day is unreasonable and may violate legal standards requiring sufficient notice for audits. This creates a situation where CHT may not have adequate time to prepare for the audit, potentially leading to disputes and legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the force majeure event duration to one business day before termination is allowed is commercially unreasonable. Force majeure clauses typically require a significant disruption before termination is permitted. Most force majeure events require longer than one business day to even assess the entire impact.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates principles of good faith and fair dealing. Could be deemed unconscionable due to the short trigger period.",

                "original_text": "No later than thirty (30) days following the Closing, each of AWP and the Company shall change its respective corporate name and trade name and cause its organizational documents to be amended to remove any reference to “Armstrong.”",
                "changed_text": "Each of AWP and the Company shall change its respective corporate name and trade name and cause its organizational documents to be amended to remove any reference to “Armstrong” immediately following the Closing.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 30-day period for changing the corporate name. The modification mandates immediate action, which may not allow sufficient time for compliance with state-specific requirements for legal name changes, such as board resolutions, filings with the Secretary of State, and notifications to relevant parties. This may also contradict typical business practices and impose unrealistic demands.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but generally, state corporate law requires a reasonable period for amending organizational documents and completing a legal name change.",

                "changed_text": "With respect to any Trademarks notified to the Company in writing after the Effective Date that are used as of the Effective Date in the Company Field and are not (i) owned by any Company Entity, (ii) Arizona Assigned Trademarks, or (iii) Seller Licensed Trademarks (the “Phase-Out Marks”) in each case (i)-(iii) the Company shall have a period of six (6) months from the date of notification to phase out all use.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives the company 24 months to phase out use of certain trademarks. The modified text reduces this period to 6 months. This could be deemed an unreasonably short timeframe for phasing out trademarks, particularly if it involves rebranding, marketing material updates, and inventory adjustments, potentially violating principles of 'reasonable notice' implied in contract law and fair business practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in contract law, as well as potential trademark law issues related to orderly transitions.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 45-day window for Arizona to act on patent infringements before the Company/Buyer can take action. The modified text reduces this to 15 days. This shortened period might be insufficient for Arizona to adequately assess the infringement, gather evidence, and prepare a case, potentially undermining their right to control their IP enforcement and potentially violating principles of good faith and reasonableness.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in contract law, and principles related to reasonable opportunity to cure or act.",

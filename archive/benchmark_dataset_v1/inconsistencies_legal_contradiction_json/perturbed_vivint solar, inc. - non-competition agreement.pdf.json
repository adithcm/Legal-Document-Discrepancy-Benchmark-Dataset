                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales Term” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the “Term”).",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue for a period of one (1) year, regardless of the expiration of the “Sales Term” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the “Term”). This agreement is not subject to renewal or extension.",
                "explanation": "By setting a fixed one-year term regardless of the underlying Sales Term and prohibiting renewal, the contract could violate state laws that require non-compete agreements to be reasonably limited in duration and tied to a legitimate business interest. Many states, including Delaware (where Vivint Solar is incorporated), require consideration of factors such as the employee's role, the scope of restrictions, and the length of the term to determine enforceability. A short, non-renewable term may be deemed unreasonable and therefore unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "5.\nMaster Framework Agreement. This Amendment is governed by the Master Framework Agreement, explicitly excluding the provisions of Sections 4 (Confidentiality) and 6 (Miscellaneous) of the Master Framework Agreement. All disputes arising from this agreement will be handled through mandatory arbitration, with the arbitrator selected solely by Vivint Solar.",
                "explanation": "By excluding the Confidentiality section of the Master Framework Agreement, the amendment weakens protections for Vivint. Furthermore, mandating arbitration with the arbitrator selected solely by Vivint Solar could be deemed unconscionable and violate principles of fairness in dispute resolution, potentially conflicting with state and federal arbitration laws requiring impartiality.",
                "contradicted_law": "State and federal arbitration laws regarding fairness and impartiality (e.g., Federal Arbitration Act, state laws on unconscionable contracts)",

Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition\nAgreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment will apply and be effective only with respect to the provisions of the Non-\nCompetition Agreement specifically referred to herein. The Non-Competition Agreement will be terminated immediately. This new agreement will serve as the sole agreement.",
                "explanation": "By terminating the non-competition agreement immediately and stating that 'this new agreement will serve as the sole agreement', it causes legal contradictions for the previous obligations that were set in place. This is a contradiction because the previous established terms and obligations are now null and void which can cause legal issues with the enforceability and potentially violate laws surrounding the proper termination and modification of existing legal agreements.",

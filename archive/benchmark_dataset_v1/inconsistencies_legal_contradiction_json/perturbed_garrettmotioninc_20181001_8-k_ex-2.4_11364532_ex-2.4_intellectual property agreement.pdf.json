                "original_text": "For a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the SpinCo Group, in SpinCo’s reasonable judgment, requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to license such Honeywell IP to the applicable member of the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Parties cannot reach agreement with respect to the terms of a license to Honeywell IP pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the applicable member of the SpinCo Group shall be permitted to challenge the validity or enforceability of such Honeywell IP (it being understood that such challenge is the sole remedy available to SpinCo in the event Honeywell does not grant such license, without regard to whether Honeywell has negotiated in good faith).",
                "changed_text": "For a period of one (1) year after the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the SpinCo Group, in SpinCo’s reasonable judgment, requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to license such Honeywell IP to the applicable member of the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms.

                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period for licensing Honeywell IP from five years to one year could be considered unreasonably short, particularly for complex technical projects. This may conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most US contract laws, especially if SpinCo requires reasonable time to integrate the IP.",

                "changed_text": "SpinCo shall, and shall cause each member of the SpinCo Group to, remove any Honeywell Trademarks or reference to the Honeywell Business appearing on any Honeywell Content at the company's earliest convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a specific deadline of 180 days for removing Honeywell trademarks. The modified text introduces ambiguity by only requiring removal at the \"company's earliest convenience\". This vagueness undermines the original, more enforceable timeline and could create non-compliance issues regarding trademark usage, especially if 'earliest convenience' is interpreted in a way that extends the period beyond what is reasonably acceptable under trademark law.",

The retention of any license grants are subject to the Divested Entity’s and, in the event it is acquired by a third party, such third party’s execution and delivery to the non-transferring Party, within 90 days of the effective date of such divestment, of a duly authorized, written undertaking, agreeing to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement.",

The retention of any license grants are subject to the Divested Entity’s execution and delivery to the non-transferring Party, within 18 months of the effective date of such divestment, of a written confirmation agreeing to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Extending the deadline for a Divested Entity to execute and deliver a written undertaking from 90 days to 18 months could be deemed unreasonably long. This delay may hinder the non-transferring party's ability to properly manage and enforce the IP licenses, potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized IP usage or infringement during the prolonged interim period. This is inconsistent with standard business practices and may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

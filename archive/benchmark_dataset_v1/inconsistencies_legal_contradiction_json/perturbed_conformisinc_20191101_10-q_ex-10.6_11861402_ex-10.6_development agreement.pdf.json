                "explanation": "The modification shortens the timeframe for assuming the agreement in a Chapter 11 case to 10 days. This contradicts bankruptcy law, which allows a debtor significantly more time to decide whether to assume or reject a contract. This creates an inconsistency because the Bankruptcy Code typically allows debtors up to 120 days, with possible extensions, to make this decision.",

If any Party believes the other is in material breach of any of its material obligations under this Agreement in a manner other than as set forth in Article III to which this Section 8.2(b) does not apply, it may give notice of such material breach to the allegedly breaching Party, which Party shall have [**] (or such longer period of time as may be reasonably commensurate with the effort reasonably required to remedy such default) in which to remedy such default. If such alleged material breach is not remedied in the time period set forth above, the Party alleging material breach shall refer the matter to the chief executive officers of each Party, who shall meet and confer within [**] after notice from the non-breaching Party of its desire for such a meeting. If the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute in such meeting and no Action has been brought in accordance with Section 10.8 with respect to such dispute, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon delivery to the defaulting Party of a Termination Notice. The non-defaulting Party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.2(b) shall not be construed as an exclusive remedy.",

                "explanation": "The original contract provides a cure period for a material breach, and a meeting with the chief executive officers of each Party if the breach is not remedied. The modified text significantly reduces the cure period to 5 days. This can be seen as unreasonable and a contradiction of general contract law principles that require providing a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach, which may not be possible in just 5 days, depending on the complexity of the breach. Additionally, the requirement of meeting with the chief executive officers of each party is removed, increasing the chance of litigation, increasing the liability for both parties.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms from within thirty (30) days to within ninety (90) days following each milestone does not, in itself, contradict any law; however, it could be considered an unfair business practice if the smaller entity, here Conformis, would be put under significant financial hardship to wait longer to receive payment.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "7.\nThe Distributor shall obtain at its own expense, all necessary licenses and permits to allow the Distributor to conduct business as contemplated herein. The Distributor represents and warrants\nthat the Distributor shall conduct business in strict conformity with all local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "7.\nThe Distributor shall obtain at its own expense, all necessary licenses and permits to allow the Distributor to conduct business as contemplated herein. The Distributor represents and warrants\nthat the Distributor shall conduct business in conformity with Principal’s interpretation of all local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the distributor will follow the *Principal's interpretation* of laws, which can be subjective and potentially conflict with the *actual* legal requirements. This could lead to non-compliance and legal issues, as businesses are legally obligated to follow the actual letter of the law, not a potentially incorrect or self-serving interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "General legal principles requiring compliance with actual laws and regulations, not interpretations thereof.",

                "changed_text": "10.\nThis Agreement shall be in effect until March 18. 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (5) days written notice, without cause.",
                "explanation": "This edit reduces the notice period for termination to 5 days. Depending on the state where PreCheck Health Services, Inc. operates, such a short notice period might be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the implications of abruptly ending a distribution agreement. Many jurisdictions mandate reasonable notice periods, and 5 days may not suffice, particularly if significant investments or ongoing obligations are involved.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with state laws requiring reasonable notice periods for contract termination, depending on the jurisdiction.",
                "location": "Section 10"

                "changed_text": "11.\nIn the event of termination, the Distributor shall be entitled to receive all orders accepted by the Principal prior to the date of termination and may sell the ordered Products in the Territory.\nPayment to be made at the Principal’s discretion, up to 120 days after shipment.",
                "explanation": "This alteration introduces a contradiction regarding payment terms upon termination. The original text states payment is due 'upon shipment.' The modification inserts 'at the Principal's discretion, up to 120 days after shipment.' This creates uncertainty and allows the Principal to delay payment significantly. Depending on the jurisdiction and industry standards, such an extended payment term (up to 120 days) could be considered unreasonable and potentially violate prompt payment laws that ensure timely compensation for goods or services, especially when termination occurs.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates prompt payment laws or industry standards regarding reasonable payment terms after termination.",

                "original_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 15 days after the end of the applicable month. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid quarterly to T&M within 45 days after the end of the applicable quarter, at LEA's convenience. Payments will be made in cryptocurrency, at the prevailing exchange rate determined by LEA.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces multiple contradictions. Firstly, changing the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly negatively impacts the payee by delaying payments. Secondly, stipulating payment at LEA's convenience introduces ambiguity and could allow for further delays. Lastly, paying in cryptocurrency and determining the exchange rate solely by LEA is unfavorable to T&B and creates potential financial instability and legal challenges, as the value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate dramatically and may be deemed an inappropriate form of payment under contract law.",

The Term shall automatically renew thereafter for successive 5-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than 90 days prior to the end of such five-year term.",

The Term shall automatically renew thereafter for successive 5-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than 15 days prior to the end of such five-year term.",
                "explanation": "Decreasing the notice period for termination from 90 days to 15 days introduces a legal contradiction. A shorter notice period might be deemed unreasonable and insufficient to allow the other party to adequately prepare for the termination of the agreement, especially considering the investments and obligations involved in developing and operating the 'Tarek's Real Estate 101' branded business. This could be challenged as a breach of good faith and fair dealing, which is implied in contracts under New York law (the governing law of this contract).",

                "original_text": "14.2 Notices. All notices and other written communications required to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the addressee in person, mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by reputable overnight courier. Any such notice shall be deemed to be delivered, given and received for all purposes as of the date so delivered, if delivered personally, or, if sent by certified or registered mail, three days following the date on which the same was deposited in a regularly maintained receptacle for the deposit of United States mail, postage and charges prepaid.",
                "changed_text": "14.2 Notices. All notices and other written communications required to be given under this Agreement shall be communicated via social media direct message. Notice shall be deemed given when the message is sent, irrespective of whether it is read or received.",
                "explanation": "Changing the notice requirements to social media direct message creates legal contradictions. Using social media for formal legal notices is unreliable and conflicts with standard contract law principles. Social media messages can be easily missed, deleted, or filtered, creating uncertainty about whether proper notice was actually given. Furthermore, deeming notice as given when sent, regardless of receipt, is highly problematic and unenforceable. This directly contradicts the established legal standard that requires reasonable certainty of receipt for notice to be effective, potentially leading to disputes and challenges regarding proper notification for crucial matters such as termination or breach of contract.",

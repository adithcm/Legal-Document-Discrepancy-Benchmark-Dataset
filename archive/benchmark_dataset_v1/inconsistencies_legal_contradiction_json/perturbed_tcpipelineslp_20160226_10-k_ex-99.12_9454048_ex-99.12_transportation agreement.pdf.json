                "changed_text": "15.\nNOTICES AND COMMUNICATIONS:\nAll notices and communications with respect to disputes arising under this Agreement must be delivered within 10 days of the event giving rise to the dispute. Delivery must be exclusively via carrier pigeon to the following address:\nDispute Resolution Department\nGreat Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership\nCommercial Services\n700 Louisiana St., Suite 700\nHouston, TX 77002-2700\nANR PIPELINE COMPANY\n700 Louisiana St., Suite 700\nHouston, TX 77002-2700",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several points of legal contradiction. Firstly, requiring disputes to be communicated within 10 days is an unreasonably short timeframe and may violate state laws that provide longer statutes of limitations for contract disputes. Secondly, limiting communication to 'carrier pigeon' is not a commercially reasonable means of communication, conflicting with the principle of good faith and fair dealing, and is likely unenforceable. Finally, specifying only one exclusive form of communication may be seen as an attempt to limit the other parties access to due process and remedy.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces legal contradictions by including terms that are against public policy and limit legal recourse. Firstly, stating that any failure to enforce a provision waives future breaches contradicts standard contract law, where waivers generally require explicit agreement or conduct. Secondly, selecting North Korea as the location for binding arbitration is unreasonable, inaccessible, and likely violates due process, as it removes the possibility of a fair and impartial hearing. Furthermore, the laws of Michigan may not apply to the location, potentially conflicting the legal jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a clause allowing the Transporter to terminate the agreement at any time without notice. This contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most jurisdictions, as it gives one party arbitrary power to end the contract, potentially harming the other party's reasonable expectations and investments. State law would likely require at least reasonable notice, or justifiable cause for termination.",

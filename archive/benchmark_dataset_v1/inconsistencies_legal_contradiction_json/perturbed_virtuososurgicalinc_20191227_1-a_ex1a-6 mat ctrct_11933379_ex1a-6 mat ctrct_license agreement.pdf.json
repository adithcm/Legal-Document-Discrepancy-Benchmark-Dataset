Each such royalty payment when made shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued.\nSaid interest and the payment and acceptance thereof shall not negate or waive the right of JHU to seek any other remedy, legal\nor equitable, to which it may be entitled because of the delinquency of any payment.",
                "changed_text": "4.5\nLate Payments: In the event that any payment due hereunder is not made when due, the payment shall accrue interest beginning on the first day following the due date thereof, calculated at the annual rate of twenty-five percent (25%), the interest being compounded daily. Each such royalty payment when made shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued. Said interest and the payment and acceptance thereof shall not negate or waive the right of JHU to seek any other remedy, legal or equitable, to which it may be entitled because of the delinquency of any payment.",
                "explanation": "The modified text changes the late payment terms to accrue interest from the first day following the due date at an annual rate of 25%, compounded daily. This conflicts with usury laws in many states, including Maryland, which may limit the maximum interest rate that can be charged. Charging interest from the first day also contradicts standard business practice and could be deemed unreasonable.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires a 60-day written notice for termination by the Company. The modified text reduces this to 10 days. This could be problematic under contract law principles of reasonable notice, especially considering the complexity of the agreement and the potential impact on JHU. Courts may find a 10-day notice period to be insufficient and thus unenforceable, particularly if JHU needs a longer time to find a new licensee or address potential market disruptions. Furthermore, under common law a 30-day notice is considered the minimum when terminating a contract.",

According to the IRS and general accounting best practices, businesses should retain financial records for at least three years. Also, this reduces JHU's ability to discover discrepancies, and by increasing the threshold for error before costs are borne by the company and limiting the inspection frequency the contract fails to protect their financials.",

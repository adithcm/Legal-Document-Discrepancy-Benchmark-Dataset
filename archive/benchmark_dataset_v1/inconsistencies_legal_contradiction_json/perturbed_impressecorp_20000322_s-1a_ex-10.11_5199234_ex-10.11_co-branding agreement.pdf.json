                "original_text": "If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid, the additional amount owed shall be paid to VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such underpayment to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit shall also be paid to VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was overpaid, the excess amount paid shall be returned by VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such overpayment.",
                "changed_text": "If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid, the additional amount owed shall be paid to VerticalNet within 5 days of notice of such underpayment to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit shall also be paid to VerticalNet within 5 days of notice of such to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was overpaid, the excess amount paid shall be returned by VerticalNet within 30 days of notice of such overpayment.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 15-day window for payment of underpaid amounts. Shortening this to 5 days may create an undue burden and could potentially conflict with standard business practices and potentially prompt payment laws that provide a more reasonable timeframe for resolving payment discrepancies. The overpayment return timeframe has been changed to 30 days, creating inconsistency within the clause. California law requires that refunds or reimbursements be issued in a reasonable time. The 15 day time period is much more reasonable than the 30 day time period.",

                "explanation": "The original text sets a two-year limitation for bringing claims related to the agreement. Reducing this to one year is below the statute of limitations for contract claims in Delaware, the governing state (which is typically three years), and could be deemed unconscionable or unenforceable, especially for claims of fraud or misrepresentation, which often require more time to uncover.",

Neither Party shall use the User Data other than in accordance with the VerticalNet privacy policy during the Term and thereafter, and parties are not responsible for ensuring the data is used in compliance with all applicable laws.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the period for maintaining User Data as Confidential Information from 5 years to 1 year and removing the restriction on disclosing it only as part of an aggregation may violate privacy laws if the data contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of California residents. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives consumers rights regarding their personal data. By shortening the period of confidentiality, and allowing free disclosure, creates a contradiction to the CCPA.",

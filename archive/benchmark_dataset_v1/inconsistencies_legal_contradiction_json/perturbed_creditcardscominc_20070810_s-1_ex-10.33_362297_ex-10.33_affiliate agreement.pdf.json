                "original_text": "All such materials shall be submitted to Chase at least seven (7) days prior to the date of first intended use.  Chase will notify Affiliate of its approval or disapproval of such materials within five (5) business days of its receipt of all information required to be submitted.",
                "changed_text": "All such materials shall be submitted to Chase at least two (2) days prior to the date of first intended use. Chase will notify Affiliate of its approval or disapproval of such materials within ten (10) business days of its receipt of all information required to be submitted.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a reasonable timeframe for submitting materials for approval and receiving a response. Reducing the submission timeframe to 2 days places an undue burden on the affiliate to produce materials quickly and is not commercially reasonable. Extending Chase's review period to 10 business days would likely cause operational bottlenecks and conflict with affiliate marketing campaign launch timelines. Such delays can lead to lost revenue and missed marketing opportunities. Therefore, the change is unreasonable and contradicts established business practices that necessitate quick turnaround times.",

At the time of termination, any links to Chase’s Website must be removed immediately. Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, without any notice of termination. At the time of termination, any links to Chase’s Website must be removed at Chase’s discretion. Affiliate will not receive Commission payments for any Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The changes to this section are designed to conflict with contract law principles and potentially state laws regarding termination notices and payment of earned commissions. Removing the requirement for any notice of termination is problematic, as many jurisdictions require reasonable notice, especially when a contract has been ongoing for a substantial period. Further, denying the affiliate commission payments for approved accounts placed during the term of the agreement contradicts the reasonable expectation that services rendered should be compensated. This is especially pertinent if the affiliate has incurred costs in promoting Chase's products or services. This clause could be deemed unconscionable or a violation of fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires Chase to post a new agreement on its website when changes are made, this modified text removes that requirement, so that Chase does not need to provide any notice before changing terms of service. This type of unilateral change is against contract law which requires an amendement to have both side's agreement. In this case, Chase has full control.",

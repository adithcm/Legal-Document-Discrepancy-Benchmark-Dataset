                "changed_text": "Dr. Murray will be paid no later than the 180th day of January based on the cumulative Net Sales of the Dr. Murray Products for the preceding 12 months based upon the following scale:",
                "explanation": "The original text states that royalty payments will be made no later than January 30th. The modified text changes the deadline to January 180th, effectively pushing the payment deadline far beyond a reasonable timeframe and potentially violating state wage payment laws. In Arizona, employers must establish regular pay periods and pay employees at least twice a month. This delay in royalty payment could be considered a violation of these laws.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 60 days' written notice for termination of the Services Term. The modified text reduces this notice period to 14 days. In many jurisdictions, a 60-day notice period is considered a reasonable minimum for contracts of this nature, particularly those involving ongoing services. Reducing it to 14 days could be considered unreasonably short and may violate standards of good faith and fair dealing implied in contract law, particularly if Dr. Murray needs more time to find another consulting oppurtunity.",

Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).",
                "explanation": "The original text states that mediation shall take place within 60 days of written notice. The modified text shortens this period to 15 days. While seemingly innocuous, depending on the complexity of the dispute and availability of mediators, 15 days might be an unreasonably short period to arrange and prepare for mediation. This could be seen as hindering the mediation process and potentially violating the requirement of good faith efforts to resolve disputes before arbitration, which is often implied in arbitration agreements.",

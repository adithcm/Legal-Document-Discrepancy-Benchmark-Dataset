                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days could be considered unreasonable and a violation of standard business practices and potentially conflict with Hong Kong's contract law principles of fairness and reasonableness, which often implies a longer notice period for significant agreements. What is considered a reasonable time depends on the contract. However, in most cases, it could be between 30 and 90 days.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 10 days is likely to be viewed as too short and unreasonable.

                "explanation": "Assuming that notice by post is deemed to have been delivered one business day after posting can be problematic. Hong Kong postal services are generally reliable, but delays can occur. Therefore, stating only one business day may not be appropriate.

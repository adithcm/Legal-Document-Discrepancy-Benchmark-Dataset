If either party materially breaches one or more of its obligations hereunder, the other party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice, if the breaching party does not cure such breach within 15 days after written notice thereof (or any mutually agreed extension). Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately, effective upon written notice, if (i) Licensee attempts to violate Section 8 or (ii) a sublicensee materially breaches its sublicense in a manner that harms the Brand, and (a) such sublicensee does not cure the same within 15 days after notice from Licensor or Licensee or (b) Licensee does not terminate such sublicense within 15 days after notice from Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.3. Termination for Breach. If either party materially breaches one or more of its obligations hereunder, the other party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice, if the breaching party does not cure such breach within 5 days after written notice thereof (or any mutually agreed extension). Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately, effective upon written notice, if (i) Licensee attempts to violate Section 8 or (ii) a sublicensee materially breaches its sublicense in a manner that harms the Brand, and (a) such sublicensee does not cure the same within 5 days after notice from Licensor or Licensee or (b) Licensee does not terminate such sublicense within 5 days after notice from Licensor.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 15 days to 5 days may be unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and good faith, which are implied in contracts under New York law (where the contract is governed, as stated in Section 9.4). Courts may deem such a short cure period unconscionable or insufficient, especially for complex breaches that require more time to rectify.",

Any notices herein shall be deemed to have been duly given if (i) delivered or delivered by facsimile, only when acknowledged by the receiving party, (ii) sent by U.S. Mail with no confirmation of delivery, or (iii) delivered by electronic mail, only if sent between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the notice provisions to require acknowledgment for faxed notices, preclude delivery confirmation for mail, and restrict email notices to a specific, highly unusual time window makes proper notice significantly more difficult and unreliable. This could be seen as a violation of good faith and fair dealing, as it imposes unreasonable burdens on the parties attempting to provide notice, potentially leading to disputes over whether notice was properly given.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement of written notice before termination for convenience contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under New York law. While a termination for convenience clause is generally enforceable, exercising it without any notice whatsoever could be deemed a breach if it is done in bad faith or to deprive the Licensee of the benefits of the agreement, especially if Licensee has made significant investments in reliance on the agreement.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Payment  to CSA no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of invoice from CSA. CSA shall submit  invoice to the Company no later than thirty (30) days after Company provides CSA with the list of the sales of Product (containing the Property with such supporting information that may be required or requested to be disclosed).",
                "changed_text": "Payment to CSA will be made at the Company's discretion, whenever funds are available. CSA shall submit invoices to the Company at intervals determined solely by the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear 30-day payment term after invoice receipt, and a 30-day deadline for CSA to submit invoices. The modified text removes any fixed deadline for payment, giving the Company full discretion over payment timing, and invoice submission. This contradicts UK law regarding prompt payment and fair trading practices, which typically require reasonable payment terms and prevent businesses from unilaterally altering payment schedules.",

                "changed_text": "Talent shall have 24 hours following receipt of such Materials or any part thereof displaying the intended use of the Property to review and for CSA to provide to Company written approval for such use.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the review period from seven days to 24 hours places an unreasonable burden on the Talent to review materials quickly. This could be considered an unfair contract term under UK law, particularly if the materials are complex or require detailed scrutiny. The shortened timeframe hinders the Talent's ability to properly assess the proposed use of their image/brand, potentially leading to approvals being rushed or not fully considered, negatively impacting their rights and reputation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (potentially, depending on the relative bargaining power of the parties) and general principles of reasonableness in UK contract law.",

                "original_text": "Talent agrees that Company shall, for a period of nine (9) months (Sell-Off Period) following the effective date of termination, have the right to continue to sell Product bearing  the Property and/or utilize advertising materials and collateral bearing the Property. Such sales and use shall be made subject to all the provisions of this Agreement and in particular clause 4 hereof.",
                "changed_text": "Talent agrees that Company shall, for a period of twenty-four (24) months (Sell-Off Period) following the effective date of termination, have the right to continue to sell Product bearing the Property and/or utilize advertising materials and collateral bearing the Property. Such sales and use shall be made at a royalty rate of 1% of Company revenues, irrespective of Clause 4 hereof.",
                "explanation": "Extending the sell-off period from 9 months to 24 months, and reducing the royalty rate to 1% removes the agreed rate of the contract. UK copyright and intellectual property laws prevent companies from using celebrity talent for extended periods without obtaining permission or paying reasonable compensation. A 1% revenue share may be deemed unreasonably low, particularly if the original agreement provided for a significantly higher percentage, thus contravening principles of fair compensation and potentially infringing on the Talent's economic rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (UK), general principles of contract law regarding fair compensation and economic rights.",

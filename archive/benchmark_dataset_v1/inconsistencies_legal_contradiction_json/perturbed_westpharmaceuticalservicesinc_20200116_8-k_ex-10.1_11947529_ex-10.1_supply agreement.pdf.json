                "original_text": "Buyer Affiliates shall pay ExxonMobil's Selling Affiliates invoice(s) not later than the days set forth in Attachment E hereto. All invoices shall be paid in full by wire transfer in accordance with the invoice's instructions.",
                "changed_text": "Buyer Affiliates shall pay ExxonMobil's Selling Affiliates invoice(s) not later than 180 days after receipt of the invoice. All invoices shall be paid in full according to payment terms to be determined at the Buyer's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces payment terms that significantly deviate from standard commercial practice and potentially violate prompt payment laws. Extending the payment period to 180 days and granting the Buyer full discretion over payment terms contradicts the general requirement for reasonably prompt payment and transparent payment terms, creating uncertainty and potential non-compliance with regulations concerning fair business practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates prompt payment laws and general principles of contract law regarding reasonable and transparent payment terms.",

                "original_text": "Buyer shall inspect and test Product delivered hereunder for damage, defect or shortage immediately upon receipt at Buyer's plant or such other location as determined by Buyer and provide Seller notice of any such damage, defect or shortage within ten (10) days of receipt. Any claims for shortages must be supported by certified railroad scale tickets (or similar documents if shipments were not by rail) and Seller shall have an opportunity to have an independent weighing. All claims for any cause whatsoever, whether based in contract, negligence or other tort, strict liability, breach of warranty or otherwise, shall be deemed waived unconditionally and absolutely unless Seller receives written notice of such claim not later than one hundred fifty (150) days after Buyer's receipt of Product as to which such claim is made.",
                "changed_text": "Buyer shall inspect and test Product delivered hereunder for damage, defect or shortage immediately upon receipt at Buyer's plant or such other location as determined by Buyer and provide Seller notice of any such damage, defect or shortage within two (2) days of receipt. All claims for shortages must be supported by uncertified railroad scale tickets (or similar documents if shipments were not by rail) and Seller does not have an opportunity to have an independent weighing. All claims for any cause whatsoever, whether based in contract, negligence or other tort, strict liability, breach of warranty or otherwise, shall be deemed waived unconditionally and absolutely unless Seller receives written notice of such claim not later than thirty (30) days after Buyer's receipt of Product as to which such claim is made.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the inspection and claim notification period to two days and thirty days respectively, is unreasonable and contradicts commercial norms. This drastically shortened timeframe is unlikely to allow sufficient time for thorough inspection and testing, which could lead to a waiver of legitimate claims. The requirement for uncertified documentation and denial of the Sellerâ€™s right to independent verification exacerbate the unreasonableness.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of reasonable notice and opportunity to inspect goods, as well as fairness in commercial transactions.",

                "changed_text": "In case of any breach of the terms and conditions contained in the Agreement by one of the parties, the other party may, without any notice or any recourse to legal proceedings, immediately suspend its further performance, terminate the Agreement or require specific performance by the other party of the Agreement in whole or in part, without prejudice to its right to damages for any losses incurred subject to Article 14.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for prior written notice and any recourse to legal proceedings before terminating the agreement for 'any breach' (not just material breaches) is a violation of fundamental contract law principles. It allows for immediate termination even for minor infractions, which goes against the principle of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates fundamental contract law principles regarding notice, opportunity to cure, and good faith termination.",

In the event that Customer is of\nthe opinion that the Product is Out Of Specification at the time of delivery, Customer shall, within [* * *] after the date of physical receipt of\nProduct, provide Supplier with a written notice to reject the Product (a “Notice of Rejection”), which shall include a description of the grounds for\nrejection and copies of test reports and testing methodology conducted on the Product, if any. However, with respect to any Out Of Specification\nProduct which would not be apparent from a reasonable visual inspection on delivery, including in the case of any hidden defects, such Notice of\nRejection shall be provided to Supplier not later than [* * *].\nThe failure of Customer or its designees to notify Supplier of any Out Of Specification Product in the manner set forth herein above shall constitute\nconfirmation of the acceptance thereof.",

In the event that Customer is of\nthe opinion that the Product is Out Of Specification at the time of delivery, Customer shall, within **2 days** after the date of physical receipt of\nProduct, provide Supplier with a written notice to reject the Product (a “Notice of Rejection”), which shall include a description of the grounds for\nrejection and copies of test reports and testing methodology conducted on the Product, if any.

                "explanation": "The original text allows a reasonable time (represented by [* * *]) for the customer to inspect the product and provide a notice of rejection. By reducing this period to '2 days' and '5 days' respectively, the modified text imposes an unreasonably short timeframe, particularly for complex products that require thorough inspection and testing. This could be considered a breach of good faith and fair dealing, as it does not provide the customer with sufficient opportunity to identify defects, potentially leading to the acceptance of non-conforming products. It also opens the door for the supplier to argue that any defects discovered after the short period are not their responsibility, shifting the burden of non-conforming products unfairly to the customer.",

                "explanation": "Many jurisdictions have prompt payment laws that mandate payment timelines exceeding ten days for commercial transactions, especially those involving pharmaceuticals. By reducing the payment period to 10 days, the contract introduces a potential conflict with these regulations, which aim to ensure fair and timely compensation for goods and services.",

                "explanation": "FDA regulations require timely notification of critical issues, such as Form 483 observations and warning letters, to ensure prompt corrective action. A 90-day delay in providing these reports could violate the principle of timely communication required under these regulations, potentially leading to regulatory penalties and patient safety concerns.

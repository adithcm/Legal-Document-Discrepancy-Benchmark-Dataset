                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment within 7 days of completion and handover. Changing this to 60 days introduces a potential delay in payment that could be viewed as unreasonable under Hong Kong's Employment Ordinance, which implies a requirement for prompt payment of wages after completion of work. Although the specific definition of 'prompt' can be debated, a delay of 60 days is excessive and could be deemed a violation of implied contractual terms of good faith and fair dealing, creating non-compliance.",

If\nthe customer terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of\ntermination with a fee calculated at VAL's discretion. Developer may also terminate this Agreement by\ngiving two (2) weeks’ notice in writing to VAL. It is applicable only when the project is not completed.\nIn case Developer terminates the agreement, it shall handover the entire project related IPR, work\ndone till date to VAL.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires VAL to give two weeks' notice for termination. The modification allows VAL to terminate 'immediately without notice' for any reason considered 'sufficient.' This creates a potential violation of Hong Kong's Employment Ordinance regarding unfair dismissal. While the contract is for independent contractors, the 'sufficient reason' provision is vague and could be abused to circumvent fair termination practices, implying a risk of arbitrary dismissal which may be scrutinized under the law. Additionally, changing the compensation calculation to 'VAL's discretion' introduces ambiguity and potential unfairness, contravening the implied duty of good faith.",

                "explanation": "While the original text clearly assigns all IP rights to VAL, the modification allows the Developer to reuse code and concepts from the project for other clients.  This creates an inconsistency and potential legal conflict under Hong Kong copyright law and contract law related to the transfer of intellectual property rights. Hong Kong law generally requires a clear and unambiguous assignment of IP rights; allowing the Developer to reuse code effectively undermines VAL's exclusive ownership. This conflicts with the initial IP assignment and introduces ambiguity about who truly owns the intellectual property created during the project.",

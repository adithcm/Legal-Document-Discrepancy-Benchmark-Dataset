                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party wishing to terminate the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least\n         thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.",
                "changed_text": "Either party wishing to terminate the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least ten (10) days prior to the desired date of termination.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to 10 days may be deemed unreasonable and could be challenged under contract law principles, especially considering the potential impact on both parties' business operations and reliance on the co-branding agreement. New York courts often require reasonable notice periods based on the nature of the agreement and the parties' expectations.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York contract law principles regarding reasonable notice for termination.",
                "location": "Section 11"

                "original_text": "The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall\n         continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to\n         annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual\n         expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent\n         shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall\n         continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to\n         annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual\n         expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent can be withheld at Lucent's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'shall not be unreasonably withheld' clause, Lucent can arbitrarily deny renewal. This may violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is present in all New York contracts. Denying renewal without a legitimate business reason could be considered a breach of this covenant.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be assigned by mPhase at any time without the prior written consent of Lucent.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for Lucent's consent for assignment could be problematic if Lucent is relying on mPhase's specific capabilities or reputation. Under New York law, contracts can restrict assignment if they explicitly state it, and removing this restriction could lead to unforeseen risks for Lucent, especially if the assignee is not as reputable or capable as mPhase.",

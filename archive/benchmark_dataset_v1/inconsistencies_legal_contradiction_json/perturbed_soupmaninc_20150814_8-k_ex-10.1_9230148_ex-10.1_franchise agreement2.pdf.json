            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A. Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement within 180 days of the date specified in the Master Franchise Agreement, regardless of any conflicting payment schedules outlined therein.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a delay in payment that may conflict with state franchise laws requiring timely payments. Many states have regulations to ensure that franchisors receive payments promptly, and a blanket 180-day delay would likely violate those regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state franchise laws regarding timely payments, such as California Franchise Relations Act or New York Franchise Sales Act, depending on the location of the franchisor.",
                "location": "Section A"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "D. Franchisor shall not be obligated to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust any security from Master Franchisee or pursue or exhaust any remedy, including any legal or equitable relief against Master Franchisee, before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations may take place before, after, or contemporaneously with, enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "D. Franchisor shall immediately pursue the Guarantors without any prior attempt to recover from Master Franchisee. The Franchisor is expressly prohibited from seeking any recourse from Master Franchisee prior to, or simultaneously with, pursuing the Guarantors.",
                "explanation": "This modification potentially violates laws related to guarantees and suretyship. Many jurisdictions require the creditor (Franchisor) to first attempt to recover from the primary debtor (Master Franchisee) before pursuing the guarantor (Guarantors). By prohibiting any action against the Master Franchisee, this clause contradicts those legal requirements, potentially rendering the guarantee unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws regarding guarantees and suretyship, such as the Statute of Frauds or common law principles of suretyship, varying by state.",
                "location": "Section D"
            },
            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "E.  Without affecting the Guarantorsâ€™ obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor, without notice to the Guarantors, may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Guarantors waive notice of amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement and notice of demand for payment or performance by Master Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "E. To further protect the Franchisor, the Guarantors' obligations will remain in full effect even if the Master Franchise Agreement is terminated due to the Franchisor's breach. The Guarantors waive all rights to assert defenses related to the Franchisor's conduct.",
                "explanation": "This change attempts to enforce the guarantee even if the underlying contract (Master Franchise Agreement) is terminated due to the Franchisor's breach. This is likely unenforceable in many jurisdictions as it removes the guarantor's fundamental right to assert defenses arising from the Franchisor's own misconduct. Good faith and fair dealing are implied in most contracts, and this change attempts to eliminate these protections for the guarantor.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is recognized in contract law in most US states. Also potentially violates principles of contract unconscionability.",

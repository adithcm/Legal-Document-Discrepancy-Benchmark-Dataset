                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a verbal communication provided to any representative of each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "explanation": "The modified text states that revocation can occur through verbal communication rather than written notice. This contradicts standard contract law principles that require written notice for significant contractual changes, as verbal agreements are harder to prove and can create ambiguity. This creates non-compliance with regulatory standards.",

                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the filing of such filings and any amendments thereto; however, no party is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning any person contained therein.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that each party is responsible for their own information's accuracy. The modified text removes this responsibility, stating that no party is responsible for the accuracy of any information, potentially violating securities laws that require accurate disclosures in filings. This creates non-compliance with regulatory standards.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for counterpart execution, a common and legally accepted practice. The modified text requires a single original document, contradicting the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) and similar state laws that recognize electronic signatures and counterpart execution as valid.

                "original_text": "Should both Parties be unable to reach an agreement within one month through negotiation, they may apply for an arbitration in Miaoli County and the arbitration result shall be compulsory.",
                "changed_text": "Should both Parties be unable to reach an agreement within three months through negotiation, they may apply for an arbitration in Miaoli County and the arbitration result shall be non-compulsory.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration after one month and makes the result compulsory. This change extends the negotiation period to three months, potentially conflicting with Taiwan's Arbitration Act (if it stipulates a different timeframe or conditions for mandatory arbitration). Additionally, changing the arbitration result to 'non-compulsory' undermines the enforceability of the arbitration agreement, conflicting with the intent of the Act to provide a binding dispute resolution mechanism.",

                "changed_text": "Stage 5: The service fee of NTD 1 million (SAY ONE MILLION ONLY) shall be paid after the Environmental Impact Assessment Report is rejected.",
                "explanation": "Payment contingent on the rejection of the Environmental Impact Assessment report creates an incentive against environmental protection and potentially violates regulations designed to ensure environmental compliance before development projects can proceed. This creates a scenario where the consultant benefits from a failure to meet environmental standards, which is counter to the goals of environmental impact assessment laws in Taiwan.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violation of the spirit and intent of Taiwan's Environmental Impact Assessment Act, which aims to protect the environment.",

                "changed_text": "Party B shall make the most economical arrangement for Party A with respect to the project, irrespective of environmental regulations.",
                "explanation": "By explicitly stating that Party B can disregard environmental regulations in favor of cost savings, this clause directly contradicts Taiwan's environmental laws, potentially leading to violations and making the contractual clause unenforceable. It removes environmental compliance as a consideration, which is illegal.",

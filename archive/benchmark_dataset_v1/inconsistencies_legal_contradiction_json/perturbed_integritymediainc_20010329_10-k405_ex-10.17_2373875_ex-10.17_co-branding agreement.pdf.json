                "explanation": "The original contract language gives Integrity five business days to respond. The modified language reduces this to one business day, which could be unreasonably short, and gives Integrity absolute discretion to reject artwork, potentially violating good faith dealing requirements. Alabama law suggests a reasonable time frame must be provided, especially if disapproval could halt operations.",

Such auditing party must make specific written objection within such two (2) year period. Thereafter, it will be deemed to have consented to any such statements or accountings which will then be considered an account stated as between the parties, not subject to any objection for any reason whatsoever. Provided the objecting party has made timely written objection, as aforesaid, such party may file an action regarding same within two (2) years and six (6) months after the applicable statement is rendered, after which time any such action will be deemed barred.",

Such auditing party must make specific written objection within such one (1) year period.

Provided the objecting party has made timely written objection, as aforesaid, such party may file an action regarding same within one (1) year and three (3) months after the applicable statement is rendered, after which time any such action will be deemed barred.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a two-year period to inspect books and a two-year and six-month period to file an action. The modified text reduces these periods to one year and one year and three months respectively. This contradicts the statute of limitations for breach of contract claims in Tennessee, which is six years. Reducing the time to file a claim may be deemed unconscionable.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires a six-month written notice for termination after an assignment to a third party. Reducing this to one month may be considered unreasonably short, potentially violating common law principles of reasonable notice for contract termination. Tennessee law implies reasonable notification based on the circumstances, and one month may be insufficient for a complex agreement like this.",

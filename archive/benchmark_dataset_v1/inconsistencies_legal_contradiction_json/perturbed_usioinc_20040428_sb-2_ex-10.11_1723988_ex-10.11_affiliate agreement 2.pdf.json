All payments to Affiliate are subject to\nNetwork  1  receipt  of all amounts payable to Network 1 by the Member Bank with\nrespect  to the transaction giving rise to Affiliate's Fee.

In the event Merchant rejects fees for\nany  reason,  the  fees  due to Affiliate shall not be due and only payable upon\nNetwork 1's receipt of such payment.

                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline to 'at the sole discretion of Network 1, with no fixed date' makes the payment term vague and unenforceable. Many states, including Texas where the Affiliate's principal place of business is located, require employers or contracting entities to pay earned wages or fees within a reasonable timeframe. Eliminating a fixed payment date introduces non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for non-renewal from 30 days to 10 days may conflict with reasonable notice requirements under general contract law principles. Courts often consider 30 days a reasonable minimum for contracts of this nature, especially where significant business relationships are involved. This change could render the termination clause partially unenforceable, depending on the jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Changing the cure period for default from 30 days to 10 days for Network 1 and 90 days for affiliate could be viewed as unconscionable and in bad faith, and might be deemed legally unenforceable by courts. Establishing different standards to cure default periods is typically determined based on the severity of default; here, the contract stipulates the cure period based on which party enacts the cure period, violating regulatory standards.",

                "original_text": "31.  Where a Member is in breach of this Agreement and that Member has not remedied the breach on notice from the Venture and after a reasonable period then the remaining Members will have the right to terminate this Agreement with regard to that individual defaulting Member (an “Involuntary Withdrawal”) and take whatever action necessary to protect the interests of the Venture.",
                "changed_text": "31. Where a Member is in breach of this Agreement, the remaining Members will have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement with regard to that individual defaulting Member (an “Involuntary Withdrawal”) and take whatever action necessary to protect the interests of the Venture. No notice or opportunity to cure the breach is required.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the 'reasonable period' for remedying a breach and removes the requirement for notice before termination. This contradicts standard legal practices and principles of fairness, potentially violating laws related to due process or contract law that require reasonable notice and opportunity to cure breaches before termination, depending on the specific breach and applicable Florida law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Laws, potentially Due Process if the breach affects significant rights.",

                "changed_text": "46. This section will survive for ninety days after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or dissolution of the Venture.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a one-year survival period for the confidentiality clause. Reducing this to ninety days may be deemed unreasonably short, especially given the sensitive business information potentially exchanged. This could conflict with trade secret laws or other regulations that expect longer protection periods for confidential information, depending on the nature of the information and the industry.",

Any notices or delivery required here will be deemed completed when hand-delivered, delivered by agent, or seven (7) days after being placed in the post, postage prepaid, to the Members at the addresses contained in this Agreement or as the Members may later designate in writing.",
                "changed_text": "67. Any notices or delivery required here will be deemed completed when sent via email, regardless of whether receipt is acknowledged, to the Members at the addresses contained in this Agreement or as the Members may later designate in writing. The date of the email will be considered the date of delivery.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the notification method to email without requiring proof of receipt. This could conflict with legal requirements for providing adequate notice, especially in cases where notice is legally mandated (e.g., for terminating the agreement, major decisions, or legal claims). Florida law may require more reliable methods of delivery, especially for important legal notices.",

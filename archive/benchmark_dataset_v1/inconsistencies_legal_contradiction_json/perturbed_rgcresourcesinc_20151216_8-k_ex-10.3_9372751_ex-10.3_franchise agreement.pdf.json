It is understood that Grantee has or will enter into franchise agreements with the City of Roanoke (“Roanoke”) and the City of Salem (“Salem”) and the Town of Vinton (“Vinton”) (Grantor, Roanoke and Salem being hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the “localities” and singularly as a “locality”) with fee provisions identical to this one, and that the total annual Franchise Fee to be paid to the three localities in aggregate is $98,196 for calendar year 2016 (“base year total annual Franchise Fee”). For calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before March 31, 2017.",
                "changed_text": "Grantee shall pay to Grantor a Franchise Fee which shall be calculated pursuant to this Section. It is understood that Grantee has or will enter into franchise agreements with the City of Roanoke (“Roanoke”) and the City of Salem (“Salem”) and the Town of Vinton (“Vinton”) (Grantor, Roanoke and Salem being hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the “localities” and singularly as a “locality”) with fee provisions identical to this one, and that the total annual Franchise Fee to be paid to the three localities in aggregate is $98,196 for calendar year 2016 (“base year total annual Franchise Fee”). For calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before December 31, 2016.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the payment deadline for the Franchise Fee for calendar year 2016 from March 31, 2017, to December 31, 2016. This could potentially violate Virginia state law if it doesn't provide a reasonable timeframe for the Grantee to calculate and remit the fee based on gas sales data, creating a potentially unfeasible timeline.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied terms of 'reasonableness' and 'good faith' in contract performance, as well as any Virginia state laws requiring reasonable timelines for financial reporting and payments.",

                "changed_text": "For each calendar year during the term of this Franchise, Grantor’s percentage share shall be determined pursuant to this Section, and paid to Grantor on or before June 30 of the succeeding calendar year.",
                "explanation": "Changing the deadline to June 30th might contradict the timely payment mandates, particularly if Roanoke Gas Company's financial reporting and audit schedules do not align with this extended deadline. While this doesn't explicitly violate a specific law, it could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if the extended deadline creates undue hardship or uncertainty for the Town of Vinton.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the required business office hours to 5 hours per week may not adequately serve the public interest and could violate implied obligations related to the quality and accessibility of services provided under the franchise agreement. Although not explicitly illegal, it could be challenged as a breach of the implicit understanding that the franchisee will provide reasonable service to the community.",

                "original_text": "Distributor shall order Products from Hydraspin by submitting purchase orders and an installation plan identifying the number(s) and type(s) of Products ordered, the requested delivery date(s) (each, an “Order”). The requested delivery date shall be no less than 120 days from the date the Order is accepted by Hydraspin. Hydraspin will not unreasonably reject any Order for Products. Hydraspin will accept or reject each Order submitted by Distributor within ten (10) days after receipt of the Order. Any Orders not expressly rejected by Hydraspin within such ten (10) day period shall be deemed accepted by Hydraspin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor may cancel any Order for Products that are not delivered within sixty (60) days after the delivery date specified therein.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall order Products from Hydraspin by submitting purchase orders and an installation plan identifying the number(s) and type(s) of Products ordered, the requested delivery date(s) (each, an “Order”). The requested delivery date shall be no less than 180 days from the date the Order is accepted by Hydraspin. Hydraspin maintains sole discretion in accepting or rejecting any Order for Products. Hydraspin will accept or reject each Order submitted by Distributor within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Order. Any Orders not expressly rejected by Hydraspin within such forty-five (45) day period shall not be deemed accepted by Hydraspin. Distributor may only cancel any Order for Products that are not delivered within one-hundred eighty (180) days after the delivery date specified therein.",
                "explanation": "Changing the requested delivery date to no less than 180 days, granting Hydraspin sole discretion to reject orders, extending the acceptance/rejection period to 45 days, stating that orders not rejected within that period are *not* deemed accepted, and extending the cancellation window to 180 days introduces contradictions because it can unreasonably hinder the distributor's ability to conduct business by imposing extended timelines, granting Hydraspin arbitrary control over orders, and delaying the distributor's ability to cancel orders when delivery is significantly delayed, thus affecting their revenue stream.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Texas contract law.",

                "original_text": "If termination is the result of a Change of Control, Distributor shall be entitled to receive a onetime payment, within three (3) business days of the effective date of the Change of Control, equal to the greater of the following 1) the aggregate amount of the Distributor Share received during the 18 months prior to the effective date of such Change of Control or 2) the aggregate amount of the Distributor Share received on the 30 days prior to the effective date of such Change of Control multiplied by 18.",
                "changed_text": "If termination is the result of a Change of Control, Distributor may be entitled to receive a onetime payment, at Hydraspin's sole discretion, within ninety (90) business days of the effective date of the Change of Control, equal to the lesser of the following: 1) the aggregate amount of the Distributor Share received during the 6 months prior to the effective date of such Change of Control or 2) the aggregate amount of the Distributor Share received on the 10 days prior to the effective date of such Change of Control multiplied by 6.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be entitled' to 'may be entitled' grants Hydraspin sole discretion over the payment, contradicting the initial binding nature of the clause. Extending the payment deadline from three (3) business days to ninety (90) business days after the Change of Control is unreasonable. Switching from 'greater of' to 'lesser of' and reducing the calculations to 6 months and 10 days negatively impacts the amount the Distributor may receive in contrast to their usual revenue streams.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential breach of contract and good faith dealing due to arbitrary change in payment terms.",

                "original_text": "All notices, requests and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing (including in portable document format (or similar format) delivered by email transmission) and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally, or sent by either certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by overnight courier guaranteeing next day delivery, or by email transmission, addressed as follows:\n\n(b) Deemed Delivery. All such notices, requests and other communications shall be deemed to have been received (i) on the date of delivery thereof, if delivered by hand, (ii) on the fifth day after the mailing thereof, if mailed, (iii) on the next business day after the sending thereof, if sent by overnight courier, (iv) on the day of sending, if sent by email transmission prior to 5:00 p.m. on any business day, or (v) on the next business day, if sent by email transmission after 5:00 p.m. on any business day or on any day other than a business day.",
                "changed_text": "All notices, requests and other communications under this Agreement must be sent exclusively through carrier pigeon, and will be deemed to have been duly given only if and when the carrier pigeon physically delivers the communication to the intended recipient. In the event that the intended recipient is unavailable to receive the communication directly from the carrier pigeon, the notice shall be deemed invalid.",
                "explanation": "By limiting acceptable communication methods exclusively to carrier pigeon, the modified text creates an unreasonable and impractical standard for providing notice under the contract. This is clearly not a commercially reasonable method and would potentially invalidate important contractual communications due to the unreliability of carrier pigeons.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates principles of reasonable notice and could be deemed unconscionable due to impracticality.",

Any Change Request shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",

Any Change Request only requires a general list. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",

Upon Client's receipt of a Milestone Deliverable following Developer's modification pursuant to Change Request (a Modified Deliverable), Client will have five (5) days to inspect, test and reevaluate such Modified Deliverable to determine acceptance.

Giving ten (10) days to the Client to inspect the changes is not enough time, which again, violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

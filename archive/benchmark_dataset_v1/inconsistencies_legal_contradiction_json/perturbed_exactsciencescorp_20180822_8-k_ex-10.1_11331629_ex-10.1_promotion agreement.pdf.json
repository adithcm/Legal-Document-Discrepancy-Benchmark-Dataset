Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the JOC shall prepare each Annual Marketing Plan and submit it for review and approval by the JSC by no later than October 1  of the then-current Calendar Year so that the JSC shall have a reasonable opportunity to review, revise and approve such Annual Marketing Plan by no later than October 31  of the Calendar Year preceding the Calendar Year to which such Annual Marketing Plan relates; provided that the Annual Marketing Plan for the 2019 Calendar Year shall be finalized by the JOC and submitted to the JSC promptly following the Effective Date, and in any event no later than December 1, 2018. It is the intent of the Parties that the Annual Marketing Plan for the remainder of 2018 will be approved by the JSC no later than October 1, 2018.

                "explanation": "The original text sets deadlines for Annual Marketing Plan submission and approval. The modified text changes these deadlines to December 31st and January 31st, respectively, delaying the planning process. This creates potential non-compliance if these delays impede timely preparation of resources and budgets mandated by marketing and sales regulations or industry best practices in the United States, especially regarding FDA-regulated products.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates weekly detailed reports from Exact to Pfizer. The modified text changes this to a discretionary, bi-annual, aggregate report. This creates non-compliance by limiting Pfizer's access to timely and granular data necessary for effective monitoring and compliance with marketing and sales regulations, especially regarding potential anti-kickback or false claims violations related to healthcare providers.",

                "original_text": "Each Party agrees to obtain and maintain, during the Term and for five (5) years after the Term, commercial general liability insurance, including products liability insurance, with minimum “A-” AM Best rated insurance carriers, in each case with limits of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence and in the aggregate. All deductibles/retentions will be the responsibility of the named insured. Pfizer and its Affiliates will be an additional insured on Exact’s commercial general liability and products liability policies, and be provided with a waiver of subrogation. To the extent of its culpability, all coverages of Exact will be primary and non-contributing with any similar insurance carried by Pfizer. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.2 to the contrary, Pfizer may meet its obligations under this Section 6.2 through self-insurance.",

All deductibles/retentions will be the joint responsibility of both parties. Pfizer and its Affiliates will not be an additional insured on Exact’s commercial general liability policies, and there will be no waiver of subrogation. Self-insurance is explicitly prohibited.",
                "explanation": "The original insurance requirements are altered to reduce coverage, exclude product liability, reduce the AM Best rating requirement, shorten the coverage period, change deductible responsibility, and remove additional insured status and waiver of subrogation. This creates non-compliance by failing to adequately protect both parties from potential liabilities, particularly product liability claims, which are significant for medical devices in the United States. Additionally, the prohibition of self-insurance contradicts typical risk management practices for large corporations.",

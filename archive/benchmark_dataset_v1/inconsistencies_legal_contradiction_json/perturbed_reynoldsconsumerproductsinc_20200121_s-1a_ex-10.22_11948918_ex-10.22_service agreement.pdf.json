                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Provider shall submit or cause to be submitted to Recipient in writing, within 15 days after the end of each month, an invoice setting forth the Fees for the Services provided to Recipient during such month in reasonable detail, as applicable, due under such invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Provider shall submit or cause to be submitted to Recipient in writing, within 45 days after the end of each month, an invoice setting forth the Fees for the Services provided to Recipient during such month in reasonable detail, as applicable, due under such invoice.",
                "explanation": "By extending the invoicing period to 45 days, the contract contradicts standard business practices and potentially conflicts with state prompt payment laws, which often mandate shorter invoicing cycles, especially for specific industries or government contracts. This creates uncertainty and could be deemed an unreasonable delay in payment processing.",

Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",

Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at one percent (1%), from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",
                "explanation": "By extending the payment period to 90 days, the contract might conflict with state laws regarding payment terms, particularly if they mandate shorter payment cycles for services rendered. Furthermore, setting the interest rate at one percent (1%) may contradict state usury laws if it is deemed excessively low and not reflective of the actual cost of delayed payment, making the term potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to ten (10) days and reducing the dismissal period for involuntary bankruptcy to thirty (30) days could be considered unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and good faith implied in contract law.

                "changed_text": "Failure by Allied to perform and comply with any of its obligations in sections 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if Allied fails to cure the breach within five (5) days following Newegg’s written notice of the breach.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 15-day cure period for breaches. Reducing this to 5 days may conflict with California law, which often requires a reasonable cure period, especially for material breaches of contract. A court might deem 5 days insufficient depending on the nature of the breach and the effort required for cure.",

If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 30-day negotiation period before legal proceedings can commence. Reducing this to 10 days might be deemed an unreasonably short timeframe under California law, potentially frustrating dispute resolution. Courts generally expect parties to engage in meaningful pre-litigation efforts, and 10 days could be seen as insufficient, especially for complex commercial disputes.",

If sent by facsimile or electronic transmission, notice shall be deemed received three (3) days after the transmission date, regardless of confirmation.",
                "explanation": "The changed text establishes a uniform 15-day receipt period for mailed notices, regardless of whether the recipient is located domestically or internationally, which contradicts typical expectations of international mail delivery times. In addition, stating that fax or electronic transmission is received 3 days after the transmission, regardless of confirmation, will be difficult to prove in court.",

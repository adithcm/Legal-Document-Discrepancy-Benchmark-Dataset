                "changed_text": "If the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may terminate this Schedule; however, any refund of amounts previously paid shall be at the Supplier's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change allows the supplier to withhold refunds even if Bank of America terminates the schedule due to a price increase. This conflicts with general contract law principles that typically require refunds for unperformed services when a contract is terminated due to a material breach or price increase by one party.",

                "explanation": "This change attempts to eliminate supplier liability for delivery and installation delays, regardless of the reason. This could conflict with implied warranties or reasonable expectations under contract law, especially if delays are caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct. Many jurisdictions do not allow parties to completely waive liability for their own gross negligence or intentional acts.",

                "explanation": "This change grants the supplier the right to change key project personnel without needing to provide a notice. This may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in the contract if the replacement personnel are unqualified or significantly disrupt the project's progress. This is especially true if the success of the project relies on the expertise/experience of specific team members.",

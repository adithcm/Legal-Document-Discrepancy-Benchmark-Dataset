                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years after its termination or expiration each Party (the “Receiving Party”) shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked “Confidential” by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (“Confidential Information”).",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after its termination or expiration each Party (the “Receiving Party”) shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked “Confidential” by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party within ninety (90) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (“Confidential Information”).",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the confidentiality period from seven years to one year, which may be considered unreasonably short for protecting sensitive business information, especially trade secrets.  Additionally, the timeframe to reduce verbal disclosures to writing is extended from 30 to 90 days, conflicting with the need for prompt confidentiality management.",

Should ArTara fail to obtain replacement insurance providing comparable coverage within such […***…] period, University will have the right to termination this Agreement effective as of the end of the […***…] period without notice or any additional cure period.",
                "changed_text": "ArTara, Affiliates, and sublicensees will obtain commercial general liability insurance prior to clinical testing. The insurance will identify University Indemnitees as additional insureds and will provide that the carrier will notify University in writing at least ten (10) days prior to cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage. Should ArTara fail to obtain replacement insurance providing comparable coverage within such ten (10) day period, University will have the right to termination this Agreement effective as of the end of the ten (10) day period without notice or any additional cure period.",
                "explanation": "The insurance notification period is reduced to 10 days. Many states require insurance companies to provide a minimum of 30 days' notice for cancellation or non-renewal of insurance policies. Reducing the notification period makes it more difficult for the University to secure replacement coverage in time, potentially leading to a lapse in coverage and violating insurance regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text has blanks which make it hard to evaluate if there is a contradiction. The revised text shortens the review and objection periods for publications to 5 and 2 days respectively, which could be deemed unreasonably short for a thorough review.

                "explanation": "Delaying the remuneration to 24 months after the first full 12-month revenue period could be seen as an unreasonable delay in payment, especially if the JV is profitable sooner. This could contradict provincial laws regarding timely payment for services or profit sharing.",

                "explanation": "Changing the reporting frequency from quarterly to annually and removing the specific release date gives NVOS more latitude, which can result in conflict with auditing and reporting requirements under Canadian Law. NVOS is required to adhere to GAAP, which requires regular reporting on the financial position of a company. Removing the frequency of reporting could result in delays for the tax authorities to receive accurate reporting of revenue and thus result in a penalty fee.",

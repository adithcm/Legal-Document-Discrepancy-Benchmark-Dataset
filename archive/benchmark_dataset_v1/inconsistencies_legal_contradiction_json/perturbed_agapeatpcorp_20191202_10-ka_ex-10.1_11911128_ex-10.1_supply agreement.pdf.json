                "original_text": "1.3\nRenewal\nThis agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of every ten (10) year term, with each subsequent term of renewal being for a ten\n(10) year term. A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than\nbreach of this agreement.",

A one (1) month notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than\nbreach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination from six months to one month may violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which exists in contract law in many jurisdictions, including England (the governing law of this agreement). A one-month notice may be deemed unreasonably short, especially considering the ten-year term and the investments made by both parties. This short notice period potentially causes significant harm and disrupts the business relationship, contradicting the principle of providing reasonable notice for contract termination.",

                "changed_text": "5.3\nRejection of defective products\nThe Customer shall inspect all Products promptly upon receipt thereof and may reject any defective Product, provided that the Customer\nshall within two (2) days after receipt of such alleged defective Product, notify the Manufacturer of its rejection and either:\n(i)\nrequest to destroy in field for credit of the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs (with approval), or\n(ii)\nrequest a Return Material Authorization (“RMA”) number and within two (2) days of receipt of the RMA number from the\nManufacturer return such rejected Product to the Manufacturer.\nProducts not rejected within the foregoing time periods shall be deemed accepted by the Customer.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the rejection notification period from seven days to two days is unreasonable and potentially violates the principle of providing a reasonable opportunity to inspect goods, implied in contract law and potentially covered under the Sale of Goods Act (if applicable under English law, given the international nature of the agreement). Two days may not be sufficient for a thorough inspection, especially for complex products or large shipments. This unreasonable constraint can lead to unfair acceptance of defective products, contradicting fair business practices.",

Following the expiry of\nthis period, the non-breaching party may execute any rights it may have both in law and under this agreement.",

Following the expiry of\nthis period, the non-breaching party may execute any rights it may have both in law and under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe to rectify a breach from 21 days to 7 days might be deemed unreasonable, especially for complex breaches requiring significant investigation or corrective action. Such a short period could conflict with legal principles requiring a fair opportunity to cure a breach, potentially leading to premature termination and related legal challenges. Although the agreement specifies 'rectifiable' breaches, the shortened timeframe does not adequately account for scenarios where a 7-day period is insufficient to genuinely address the issue, conflicting with the implied duty of good faith.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 2-year non-competition period. Reducing this to 6 months may be considered unreasonably short under British Columbia law (where the contract is governed), potentially making it unenforceable, especially if it harms Western Copper's ability to compete effectively after the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the period for Western Copper to respond to a Disposition Notice from 30 days to 5 days and the period Glamis has to dispose of the property from 3 months to 1 month may not provide Western Copper with adequate time to assess the opportunity and secure financing, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract law under British Columbia law. This could be argued as hindering Western Copper's ability to exercise its right of first offer.",

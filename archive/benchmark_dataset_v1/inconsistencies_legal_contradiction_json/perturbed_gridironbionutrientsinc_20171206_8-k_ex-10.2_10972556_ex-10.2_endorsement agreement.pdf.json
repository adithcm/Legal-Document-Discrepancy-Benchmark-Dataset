                "original_text": "Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter beginning on the first full quarter [three (3) month period] of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter beginning 18 months after the start of the Agreement, and continue on an annual basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the initial disbursement period to 18 months and alters the frequency to annually. Many states, including California, require charitable donations raised in connection with commercial ventures to be disbursed more frequently and in a timely manner. Delaying the initial disbursement and changing the frequency may violate regulations related to timely charitable donations, which could lead to legal issues.",

                "changed_text": "The Company will provide the NFLA-NC sales reports at the Company's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for the company to provide quarterly sales reports upon request. This creates a conflict because by California law, businesses are required to maintain accurate records and, when dealing with charitable contributions based on sales, provide reasonable access to information supporting those contributions. Removing the guaranteed access to sales reports hinders transparency and potentially violates requirements for accountability in charitable fundraising.",

The Company may unilaterally add or remove other products to/from the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period without any amendment to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change allows the company to unilaterally modify the list of 'Licensed Products'. This contradicts general contract law principles requiring mutual consent for modifications. By permitting the company to unilaterally add or remove products from the license, the contract introduces ambiguity and potential for disputes. This can lead to legal challenge based on lack of mutual agreement.",

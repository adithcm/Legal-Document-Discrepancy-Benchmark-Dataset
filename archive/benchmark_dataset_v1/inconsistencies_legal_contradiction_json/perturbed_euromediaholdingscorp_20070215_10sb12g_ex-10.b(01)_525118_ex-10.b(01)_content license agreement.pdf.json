            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(c) Payment of License Fees shall be made in Canadian funds in arrears within thirty (30) days following each calendar month during the Term in which Licensed Programs were exhibited hereunder and shall be accompanied by a statement of account showing the calculation of the License Fees.",
                "changed_text": "(c) Payment of License Fees shall be made in Canadian funds in arrears within ninety (90) days following each calendar quarter during the Term in which Licensed Programs were exhibited hereunder and shall be accompanied by a statement of account showing the calculation of the License Fees.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly and extends the payment deadline from 30 days to 90 days. This creates a legal contradiction if the jurisdiction mandates more frequent payments or has laws regarding prompt payment of royalties/fees within a shorter timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Canadian provincial laws regarding prompt payment or industry standards requiring more frequent royalty payments.",

                "changed_text": "Either Rogers or Licensor may, at its option and without prejudice to any other remedies available to it, immediately terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to the other party for any one or more of the following causes:\n\n(a) the other party defaults in the performance or observance of any of the material terms of this Agreement and such default continues for a period of ten (10) days after written notice thereof;",
                "explanation": "The original agreement provides a 30-day cure period for defaults. Reducing this to 10 days may be deemed unreasonably short under applicable law, especially if the default involves complex issues or requires significant corrective action. This could be seen as a violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period from 60 days to 10 days could be considered commercially unreasonable, especially given the potential impact on Licensor's business operations. This modification conflicts with legal precedents that require termination clauses to be fair and equitable, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the payment period to 15 days may be considered an unreasonably short timeframe for policyholders to respond and make necessary payments, potentially conflicting with consumer protection laws that require fair and reasonable opportunity to address financial obligations.",

                "explanation": "Stating categorically that 'no dividends will be credited under any circumstances' despite the contract being eligible for dividends can contradict the policyholder's reasonable expectation of receiving dividends if a divisible surplus exists, potentially violating insurance regulations that require fair and equitable distribution of surplus.",

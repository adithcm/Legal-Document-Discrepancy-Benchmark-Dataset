If the Agreement\nexpired prior to the Amendment Effective Date, any orders received and Products and Services purchased between the date of expiration and the\nAmendment Effective Date shall be in all respects deemed made under the Agreement as in effect prior to this Amendment. The parties further\nagree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such\nPurchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; provided, however that acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase\nOrder placed after the Agreement has expired will not be considered as an extension of the term of the Agreement nor a renewal thereof.",

If the Agreement\nexpired prior to the Amendment Effective Date, any orders received and Products and Services purchased between the date of expiration and the\nAmendment Effective Date shall be in all respects deemed made under the Agreement as in effect prior to this Amendment. The parties further\nagree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such\nPurchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase\nOrder placed after the Agreement has expired will be considered as an indefinite extension of the term of the Agreement and a renewal thereof.",
                "explanation": "By stating that acceptance of purchase orders after expiration constitutes an indefinite extension, this clause could contradict the Statute of Frauds. The Statute of Frauds typically requires contracts that cannot be performed within one year to be in writing. An 'indefinite extension' creates uncertainty about the contract's duration, potentially rendering it unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds if it's not properly documented and agreed upon in writing.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor's key personnel who directly support Cisco's account must complete training (provided by Distributor, Cisco or another third party) on compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws within the past 24 months of the date when this Agreement becomes effective. Key personnel must receive this training only once during the term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the required anti-corruption training to within 'the past 24 months' and requiring it 'only once during the term of this agreement' contradicts the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which emphasizes ongoing compliance and due diligence. A longer training interval reduces the effectiveness of the compliance program and increases the risk of violations. This also weakens the company's defense against potential FCPA violations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for a breach of representations and warranties and allowing termination 'at their sole discretion, without cause or written notice,' this clause contradicts fundamental principles of contract law requiring good faith and fair dealing. Such a clause could be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, especially if state laws require 'cause' for termination in franchise-like or distribution agreements.",

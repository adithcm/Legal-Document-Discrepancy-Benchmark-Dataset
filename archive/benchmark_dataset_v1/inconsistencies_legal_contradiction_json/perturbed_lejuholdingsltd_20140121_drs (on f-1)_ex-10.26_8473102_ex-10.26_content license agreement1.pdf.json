                "original_text": "Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the “Commission”) to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission’s then effective rules (the “Rules”) and this Section 10.12.",
                "changed_text": "Any Dispute which remains unresolved within fifteen (15) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the “Commission”) to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission’s then effective rules (the “Rules”) and this Section 10.12.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 60-day period for dispute resolution through friendly consultation. Reducing this period to 15 days may be seen as unreasonably short under PRC law, potentially hindering the parties' ability to resolve disputes amicably and increasing the likelihood of arbitration. This could be viewed as a violation of good faith negotiation principles.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a reimbursement period of 7 days for tax payments made by one party on behalf of the other. Changing this to 180 days could violate tax regulations in the PRC, which may require more prompt reimbursement of tax-related expenses to ensure compliance and avoid penalties. This is contradictory with Article 10.1 of the contract: Each Party shall be responsible for taxes that should be borne by it in accordance with applicable Law.",

The changed text replacing it will violates the Internet Content Regulations of the People's Republic of China, which require specific and immediate actions for removing prohibited content. Removing the defined timeframe and replacing it with 'at their earliest convenience' introduces ambiguity and allows for delays, potentially violating content control laws.",

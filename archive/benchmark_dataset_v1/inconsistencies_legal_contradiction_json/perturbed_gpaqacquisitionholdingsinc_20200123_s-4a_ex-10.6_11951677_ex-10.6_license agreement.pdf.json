                "original_text": "PFHOF shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice. If PFHOF does not approve the proposal as set forth in the Notice within fourteen (14) days of PFHOF’s receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, such proposal shall be deemed rejected by PFHOF.",
                "changed_text": "PFHOF shall, within seventy (70) days of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice. If PFHOF does not approve the proposal as set forth in the Notice within seventy (70) days of PFHOF’s receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, such proposal shall be deemed rejected by PFHOF.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the approval/rejection period for PFHOF's decision regarding the Village Media Company's proposal from 14 days to 70 days. Ohio law (and general contract law principles) require timely decisions to avoid hindering business operations. Excessively delaying approval process may constitute a breach of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment.",

                "explanation": "The change reduces the notice period required to prevent automatic renewal of the agreement from six months to one month. Ohio law and general contract law necessitate a reasonable notification period for non-renewal to allow the other party adequate time to prepare, especially when a contract entails long-term business relationships and significant financial investments. Shortening the notice period may render the renewal clause unconscionable and unenforceable, especially if the non-renewing party has accrued substantial benefits, which is a case of unjust enrichment.",

                "explanation": "The modified text removes the requirement for \"written documentation\" to prove prior knowledge, eliminates the \"without access\" clause for independently developed information, omits \"through no fault of the Receiving Party\" from the public domain exception, and takes away the \"free from any obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party.\" Removing these protections weakens the confidentiality clause and could conflict with Ohio's trade secret law, which requires reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy.",

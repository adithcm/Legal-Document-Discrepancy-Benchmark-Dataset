                "changed_text": "3. This Termination Agreement shall be governed solely by principles of equity and fairness, without reference to any specific jurisdiction's laws.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit governing law (PRC law) and replacing it with vague principles of 'equity and fairness,' the agreement introduces ambiguity and contradicts established contract law. Contract law generally requires a defined jurisdiction to govern disputes, and failing to specify this can lead to unenforceability. It contradicts the PRC Contract Law, which would normally govern such agreements executed and performed within China.",

                "original_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",
                "changed_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon 30 days of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, however, provisions related to intellectual property will last for 10 years.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a 30 day window post execution which allows for further ambiguities. Also it states that intellectual property survives such terminations. This contradicts standard IP protection law in PRC and creates a potential for dispute of original agreement based on PRC regulations regarding termination of contracts.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Termination Agreement represents the understanding between the parties, and may be modified orally.",
                "explanation": "By stating that this contract may be modified orally, it directly contradicts contract law. Many jurisdictions, including China, require that modifications to contracts, especially those concerning significant rights and obligations, be in writing to be enforceable. This oral modification clause conflicts with fundamental principles of contract law.",

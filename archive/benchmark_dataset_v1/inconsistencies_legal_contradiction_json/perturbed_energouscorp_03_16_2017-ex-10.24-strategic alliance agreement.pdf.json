                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds and other solutions.",
                "changed_text": "ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds and other solutions. However, DIALOG must raise any objections to the workaround within 24 hours, otherwise, ENERGOUS will proceed with the proposed solution without further input from DIALOG.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a timeline that may be unreasonably short for a company to adequately assess technical workarounds, potentially leading to inadequate solutions and disputes. This could be seen as breaching the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the complexity of the issue.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, contract law principles regarding reasonableness.",
                "location": "11.2(d)"

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "DIALOG must notify ENERGOUS within thirty (30) business days after receipt of actual notice of any Claim by a third party for which it seeks indemnification",
                "changed_text": "DIALOG must notify ENERGOUS within five (5) business days after receipt of actual notice of any Claim by a third party for which it seeks indemnification",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period to five (5) business days for third-party claims significantly shortens the time DIALOG has to investigate and prepare a comprehensive claim for indemnification. This could violate legal principles requiring reasonable timeframes for fulfilling contractual obligations, and could be seen as prejudicial if it hinders DIALOG's ability to present a strong case.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles regarding reasonable notice and opportunity to investigate claims.",
                "location": "12.3"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ENERGOUS agrees that, [***].",
                "changed_text": "ENERGOUS agrees that, in the event of a potential merger or acquisition, it has no obligation to notify DIALOG.",
                "explanation": "By removing the obligation for ENERGOUS to provide notice of a merger or acquisition, DIALOG is deprived of the opportunity to assess the impact of the change on their strategic alliance. Depending on the nature of the new entity, this could materially affect DIALOG's rights and obligations under the agreement. This change may be a violation of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as it effectively allows ENERGOUS to conceal information that is vital to DIALOG's interests and strategic planning.",

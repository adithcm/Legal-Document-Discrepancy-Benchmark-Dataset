                "explanation": "The original text mandates content delivery within 14 days, which may be insufficient for complex content preparation, conflicting with laws that may require reasonable timeframes for contract fulfillment. This introduces a delay that may disrupt plan_b's operations and expose them to potential breach of contract claims if the content is not delivered within the unreasonably short timeframe. The modified text changes the content delivery timeline to be 30 days.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates report delivery within 6 weeks of the end of a quarter, which may be insufficient time to compile the report. This introduces a delay that may cause LICENSOR to be unable to review the records in time. The modified text changes the report delivery timeline to be 12 weeks.",

                "changed_text": "The Initial Term shall automatically be extended for an additional period of half a year unless either party provides the other party with written notification of termination of the letter Agreement at least 15 days prior to end of such period.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 60 days' notice for termination, offering a reasonable timeframe for both parties to prepare for the contract's end. Reducing it to 15 days creates potential conflicts with standard business practices and state laws requiring sufficient notice for contract terminations. This abbreviated timeframe could be deemed commercially unreasonable and open to legal challenges, as it disrupts orderly transitions and planning.",

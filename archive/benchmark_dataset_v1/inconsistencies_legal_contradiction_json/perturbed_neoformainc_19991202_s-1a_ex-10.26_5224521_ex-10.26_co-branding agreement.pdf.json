                "original_text": "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall mean all proprietary and confidential\ninformation of a Party, including, without limitation, trade secrets, technical\ninformation, business information, sales information, customer and potential\ncustomer lists and identities, product sales plans, sublicense agreements,\ninventions, developments, discoveries, software, know-how, methods, techniques,\nformulae, data, processes and other trade secrets and proprietary ideas, whether\nor\n   2\nnot protectable under patent, trademark, copyright or other areas of law, that\nthe other Party has access to or receives and which, if disclosed in writing, is\nmarked as \"Confidential Information,\" or if disclosed orally, is confirmed in\nwriting to be \"Confidential Information\" within five days of such oral\ndisclosure, but does not include information that (a) is or becomes publicly\navailable through no fault of the receiving Party; (b) was already known to the\nreceiving Party at the time it was disclosed to the receiving Party, as\nevidenced by written records of the receiving Party; (c) is independently\ndeveloped by or on behalf of the receiving Party without reference or access to\nsuch information, as evidenced by written records of the receiving Party; or (d)\nis received from a third party who is under no obligation of confidentiality to\nthe disclosing Party.",
                "changed_text": "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall mean all information exchanged between the parties, whether or not marked confidential. There is no requirement to confirm orally disclosed information in writing. The receiving party is obligated to treat all such information as confidential immediately upon receipt. This definition excludes only information that becomes publicly available due to the receiving party's actions.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the requirement for written confirmation of orally disclosed information, contradicting standard trade secret protection practices that necessitate clear identification and documentation of confidential information. It also weakens the exclusions, making almost all information confidential, which is overly broad and likely unenforceable, contradicting established legal precedent regarding reasonable confidentiality agreements. The reduction in time to 0-days contradicts generally accepted business practices.",

The Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party of its\napproval or disapproval of such advertising materials as soon as practicable,\nbut in any event within five business days after Receiving Party's receipt\nthereof. Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such five business\nday period shall be deemed disapproval of the advertising materials in question.",

                "explanation": "This alteration gives exclusive control over co-promotion advertising materials to the Originating Party's legal counsel, effectively removing the Receiving Party's right to review and approve such materials. This contradicts the principle of mutual agreement in contracts and potentially violates state laws regarding fair advertising practices and consumer protection, as one party could unilaterally disseminate misleading or harmful advertising without the other party's consent.",

If court proceedings to\nstay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who\nunsuccessfully opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses\nand attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other Party.",
                "changed_text": "Regardless of the outcome, each Party will always bear its own attorneys' fees and costs, even if one party is found to have acted in bad faith. The arbitrator has no authority to deviate from this clause.",
                "explanation": "This modification attempts to prevent the arbitrator from awarding attorney's fees to the prevailing party, even in cases where the losing party acted in bad faith. This can conflict with state laws that allow or mandate the recovery of attorney's fees in certain types of disputes or when one party's conduct warrants it. By denying the arbitrator the power to award fees, the clause contradicts these statutory provisions and may be unenforceable.",

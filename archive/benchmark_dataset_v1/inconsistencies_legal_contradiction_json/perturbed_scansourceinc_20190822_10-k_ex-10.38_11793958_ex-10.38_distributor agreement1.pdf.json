                "changed_text": "4.2 Cisco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide order acknowledgement information within 30 business days for all Purchase Orders placed on Cisco.com or within 45 business days of Purchase Orders faxed or hand delivered to Cisco.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the time frame for order acknowledgment, which could conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under California law (where Cisco is located). Unreasonably delaying order acknowledgment could hinder Distributor's ability to manage inventory and fulfill orders, potentially leading to business losses.",

                "explanation": "This modification reduces the payment terms to 15 days. Such a short payment window may be commercially unreasonable and could violate California's prompt payment laws if it unduly burdens the distributor. The California Prompt Payment Act generally requires payments to be made within a reasonable time frame, and 15 days may not be sufficient, especially considering the complexities of international transactions.",

[*****].",
                "explanation": "This modification shortens the audit notice period to 24 hours. Providing only 24 hours' notice for an audit could be deemed unreasonable under California law, particularly given the complexity of distributor operations and the need to gather and prepare extensive records. Such short notice may constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

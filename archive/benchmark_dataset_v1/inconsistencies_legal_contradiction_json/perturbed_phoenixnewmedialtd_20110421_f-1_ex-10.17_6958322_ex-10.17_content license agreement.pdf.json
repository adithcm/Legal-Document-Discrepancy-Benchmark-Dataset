                "original_text": "In the event that one Party is in breach of its obligations hereunder and fails to cure such breach within ten (10) Business Days following the other Party’s written notice thereof, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement;",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the cure period for a breach of contract to two business days. This may be unreasonably short under PRC law, potentially conflicting with provisions requiring fair and reasonable opportunity to remedy a breach, especially considering the complexities of international business relationships.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with PRC Contract Law Article 112, which implies a reasonable period for cure.",

In the event that such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) Business Days following such notice, either Party may upon the expiration of the such 30-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect.",

In the event that such dispute is not resolved within five (5) Business Days following such notice, either Party may upon the expiration of the such 5-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period to five business days is likely insufficient for resolving complex commercial disputes under PRC law, especially involving international parties.

                "explanation": "Under PRC law, parties affected by force majeure events typically have a duty to notify the other party within a reasonable time and provide evidence substantiating the force majeure event. Eliminating the notification requirement entirely may violate this obligation, potentially leading to liability for breach of contract, even if the non-performance was genuinely caused by force majeure. In China, it is mandatory to provide a certificate from an authority.",

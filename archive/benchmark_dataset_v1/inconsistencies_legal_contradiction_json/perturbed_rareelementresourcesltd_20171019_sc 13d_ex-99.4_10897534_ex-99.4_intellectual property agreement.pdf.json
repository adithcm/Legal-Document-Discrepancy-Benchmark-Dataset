                "original_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Company elects to abandon any patent application, to not pay maintenance fees or annuities to keep a patent in force, or to otherwise take or fail to take any action that will result in a loss of patent rights, Company shall give Investor at least sixty (60) days prior written notice and an opportunity to take over the prosecution of the patent application that would be abandoned and/or pay the fees necessary to keep the patent in force and/or take any other action necessary to avoid the loss of patent rights.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Company elects to abandon any patent application, to not pay maintenance fees or annuities to keep a patent in force, or to otherwise take or fail to take any action that will result in a loss of patent rights, Company shall give Investor at least ten (10) days prior written notice and an opportunity to take over the prosecution of the patent application that would be abandoned and/or pay the fees necessary to keep the patent in force and/or take any other action necessary to avoid the loss of patent rights.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for patent abandonment to 10 days may be insufficient under patent law and best practices. It might not provide the investor with adequate time to assess the patent's value and arrange for continued prosecution, potentially violating their rights and creating a legal challenge.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 5 days may be considered unreasonably short, especially for complex breaches. This could be seen as a violation of fair dealing and good faith principles, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable.",

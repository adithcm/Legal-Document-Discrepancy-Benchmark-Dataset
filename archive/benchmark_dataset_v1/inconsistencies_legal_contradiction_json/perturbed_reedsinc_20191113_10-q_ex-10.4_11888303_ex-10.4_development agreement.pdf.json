                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Impacted Party shall give notice within seven (7) days of the Force Majeure Event to the other party, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue. The Impacted Party shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized.",
                "changed_text": "The Impacted Party shall give notice within twenty one (21) days of the Force Majeure Event to the other party, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue. The Impacted Party shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized.",
                "explanation": "This changes the notification timeline for a Force Majeure event. While not a direct violation, delaying the notification period can be considered unreasonable and potentially harmful, especially since the original timeline was 7 days. In commercial contracts, failing to provide prompt notice can be considered a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially considering that the contract jurisdiction is New York, which takes into account the intent of the parties.",

                "explanation": "This modification shortens the cure period for non-compliance from 30 days to 10 days. In contract law, a cure period must be reasonable. Reducing it to 10 days, particularly in a complex development agreement, could be deemed unreasonable and a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, because it does not provide enough time for the party to reasonably correct their mistakes, since it requires the party to make the other party whole in such short amount of time.",

                "original_text": "The Impacted Party shall give notice within seven (7) days of the Force Majeure Event to the other party, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue. The Impacted Party shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized. The Impacted Party shall resume the performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable and to the greatest extent possible after the removal of the cause. In the event that the Impacted Party’s failure or delay remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following written notice given by it under this Section 15, either party may thereafter terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice.",
                "changed_text": "The Impacted Party shall give notice within seventy (70) days of the Force Majeure Event to the other party, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue. The Impacted Party shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized. The Impacted Party shall resume the performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable and to the greatest extent possible after the removal of the cause. In the event that the Impacted Party’s failure or delay remains uncured for a period of ten (10) days following written notice given by it under this Section 15, either party may thereafter terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days’ written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change modifies two key timelines within the Force Majeure clause: First, extending the notice period for a Force Majeure event from 7 days to 70 days and shortening the period of uncured failure or delay from 30 days to 10 days. Under New York law, these adjustments could be considered unreasonable, therefore violating of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The extended notice period may substantially prejudice the other party's ability to mitigate damages resulting from the event. Shortening the period to terminate for the delays is equally concerning.

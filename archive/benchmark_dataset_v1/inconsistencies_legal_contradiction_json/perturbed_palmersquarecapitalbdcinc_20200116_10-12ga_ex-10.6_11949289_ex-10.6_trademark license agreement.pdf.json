                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon sixty (60) days’ written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor with no prior notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the requirement of providing a sixty (60) day written notice period before termination by the Licensor. This creates a contradiction because contract law generally requires reasonable notice for termination to allow the other party to mitigate damages or find alternative arrangements. Eliminating the notice period could be deemed unconscionable or a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the Licensee has made significant investments based on the agreement.",

                "original_text": "For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall immediately discontinue using the Licensed Mark. Licensee has no obligation to notify the public that it is no longer associated with Licensor.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the requirement for the Licensee to notify the public about the termination of the agreement and their disassociation with the Licensor. This could be problematic under trademark law, particularly concerning potential consumer confusion. If the Licensee continues operations in a similar field without clarifying their disassociation, consumers may incorrectly assume continued affiliation, leading to potential claims of trademark infringement or unfair competition against both parties, especially if the Licensee's quality declines. The modification directly contradicts the Lanham Act's purpose of preventing consumer confusion and protecting trademarks.",

                "explanation": "This modification specifies that telepathy is the acceptable form of communication. This directly contradicts the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts (or modifications thereof) to be in writing to be enforceable. Furthermore, it is against the basic principle that contracts need to have a method of proof if ever contested in court.",

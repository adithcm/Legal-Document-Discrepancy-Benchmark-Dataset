The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",

The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the dispute notification period from seven (7) days to two (2) days. This could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe to review detailed financial reports, potentially conflicting with general contract law principles of fairness and reasonable opportunity to review, and could run afoul of laws in New York that suggest a reasonable timeframe must be afforded. The change creates a timeline that is arguably too strict to be considered fair, especially given the complexity of financial reporting.",

In the event that PrimeCall disputes any amounts set forth on the report, PrimeCall shall provide DeltaThree with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within seven (7) days of its receipt thereof.

In the event that PrimeCall disputes any amounts set forth on the report, PrimeCall shall provide DeltaThree with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within two (2) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",
                "explanation": "By extending the reporting deadline to the 15th and shortening the dispute window to 2 days after receipt, it puts undue pressure on PrimeCall to quickly analyze the report and raise disputes, which goes against what is reasonable and fair. The change creates a timeline that is arguably too strict to be considered fair, especially given the complexity of financial reporting.",

                "explanation": "While not explicitly illegal, extending the payment timeframe to 45 days introduces a significant delay in payment. For small businesses, this delay could create cash flow issues, impacting their ability to meet obligations. It pushes the bounds of what is considered 'reasonable' within generally accepted accounting principles and potentially contradicts implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under New York law.",

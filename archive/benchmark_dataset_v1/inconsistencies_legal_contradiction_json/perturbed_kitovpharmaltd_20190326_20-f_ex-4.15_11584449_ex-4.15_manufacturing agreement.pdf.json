                "original_text": "Kitov shall provide Dexcel with reasonable Packaging and Labelling instructions for the Livery (by SKU), including, but not limited to, artwork for Labels and patient leaflets, as soon as practicable following the Effective Date; provided, however, that Kitov shall provide such instructions at least one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the anticipated Supply Commencement Date. Kitov shall provide Dexcel with its Product Packaging and Labeling instructions, including, but not limited to, approved artwork, with respect to any new SKU (for a new Product Distributor or new country), as well as changes to or destruction of existing materials at least one hundred and fifty (150) days prior to the anticipated first supply of each such SKU.",
                "changed_text": "Kitov shall provide Dexcel with reasonable Packaging and Labelling instructions for the Livery (by SKU), including, but not limited to, artwork for Labels and patient leaflets, as soon as practicable following the Effective Date; provided, however, that Kitov shall provide such instructions at least thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Supply Commencement Date. Kitov shall provide Dexcel with its Product Packaging and Labeling instructions, including, but not limited to, approved artwork, with respect to any new SKU (for a new Product Distributor or new country), as well as changes to or destruction of existing materials at least forty-five (45) days prior to the anticipated first supply of each such SKU.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for providing packaging and labeling instructions creates a legal inconsistency. Pharmaceutical manufacturing requires sufficient lead time for regulatory compliance and quality control. Abbreviating this to 30 and 45 days, respectively, might not be compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and could lead to regulatory issues in the US or EU, where longer lead times are often required for labeling and packaging changes.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR § 211.122 - In certain jurisdictions like the US, regulations necessitate appropriate timeframes to ensure labeling accuracy and compliance, which may exceed the altered contractual period.",

                "changed_text": "All payments shall be made by bank transfer to such account as may be indicated by Dexcel, Dexcel and Kitov each bearing their own bank transfer costs, net ninety (90) days from Delivery. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 90 days introduces potential inconsistencies with prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions (including the US, and potentially applicable given the USD currency). While a 30-day net payment term is standard, a 90-day term may violate laws designed to ensure timely payments to suppliers, particularly if Dexcel is a small or medium-sized enterprise.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates prompt payment laws applicable in various US states, which mandate specific payment timelines, generally shorter than 90 days, to protect suppliers.",

In the event that a defect is not apparent upon visual inspection during the shelf life of the Product (“Hidden Defect”), Kitov shall use commercially reasonably best efforts to provide Dexcel with written notification within thirty (30) Working Days of discovering the same, to be accompanied by samples of any such allegedly defective Product, if such samples are available In the event of any failure by Kitov to provide Dexcel with written notification of any such shortfall, Apparent Defect or Hidden Defect within the respective aforementioned periods, it shall be deemed as Kitov having accepted the relevant consignment.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for defects to 10 working days may be inconsistent with commercial reasonableness and industry standards, especially in pharmaceutical manufacturing. It may violate the implied warranty of merchantability by unduly restricting the buyer's ability to inspect and report defects within a reasonable time, potentially conflicting with legal principles governing product acceptance and rejection.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied warranty of merchantability and applicable legal standards for 'reasonable time' for inspection and notification of defects under commercial law (e.g., UCC in US jurisdictions).",

                "explanation": "Requiring payment within one business day of the effective date is unreasonably short and could violate general principles of contract law regarding reasonable time for performance, particularly in Illinois where the contract can be properly filed, as it puts undue pressure on ebix. Normal business practices typically allow more than 1 business day for such payments.",

                "explanation": "Charging 25% per year interest on overdue payments is usurious and violates state laws (like Illinois, where About could properly filed a suit as mentioned in section 15.4) that set maximum interest rates on debts. This rate significantly exceeds the legal limits for contractual interest.",

About shall provide ebix with at\nleast five (5) days' prior notice of an audit and such audit shall be\nconducted at ebix's offices for a maximum period of five business days, during\nregular business hours, subject to About's determination.",
                "explanation": "Allowing About to audit ebix's records retroactively to the beginning of the agreement without any limitation and only providing a 5 day notice, is considered unreasonable and unduly burdensome under general contract law principles. These principles dictate that audit provisions must be reasonable in scope and timing, and that the auditing party must give the other party adequate notice so as to not impede the business operations.",

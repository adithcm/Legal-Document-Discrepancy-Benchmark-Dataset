                "changed_text": "Once every twenty-four (24)\nmonths, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect\nand audit such records to verify reports.\nAny such inspection will be conducted in a\nmanner that does not unreasonably interfere\nwith i-Escrow's business activities and with\nno less than five (5) days notice.\ni-Escrow shall within four (4) weeks make any\noverdue payments disclosed by the audit.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for annual audits with a 15-day notice period. The modified text changes this to audits every two years with only five days' notice, which could be considered an unreasonably short notice period, hindering i-Escrow's ability to prepare, potentially conflicting with standards of 'reasonable access' to records, or good faith practices depending on jurisdiction. Moreover, extending the payment period to four weeks after the audit finding could be considered an unreasonable delay in resolving discrepancies.",

In the event that either\nparty does not give such notice, the term of\nthis Agreement shall be automatically\nrenewed for another one (1) year.",
                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the renewal notice period from 30 days to 10 days. Depending on the nature of the agreement and industry standards, a 10-day notice period might be deemed insufficient, especially considering that the agreement is automatically renewed. This could be argued as a violation of good faith business practices as it doesn't allow sufficient time to evaluate the terms, ensure that it remains beneficial, and that all conditions are met before renewal.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the return of confidential information within 14 days of request upon termination. The modified text changes this to require destruction rather than return, and extends the deadline to 30 days. While seemingly minor, the requirement for destruction creates risk of non-compliance. The party that gets the confidential information could use it before the destruction deadline, and can hide it, which could also cause business ethics issues. A fourteen-day deadline would allow 2TheMart to review the documents that were returned and make sure there were no discrepancies, and that the confidential information had not been compromised. ",

                "changed_text": "Contractor shall permit Customer to audit its quality procedures, upon one (1) business day advance written notice to Contractor and shall provide all assistance which is reasonably necessary for Customer to evaluate the quality of the Products.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the advance notice for audits to one business day may be considered unreasonable and insufficient under Israeli law, potentially conflicting with accepted business practices for providing adequate preparation time, thus creating a legal inconsistency by imposing an unfeasible timeline. This violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract performance under Israeli contract law.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment terms to 'current plus sixty (60) days' and making it subject to 'contractor's discretion' without clear justification might contradict Israeli Late Payment Law, which aims to ensure timely payments and may render extended or discretionary payment terms unreasonable and unenforceable, especially for smaller businesses.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for claims to one business day is unreasonably short, especially considering the complexities of legal claims. This violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract performance under Israeli contract law.",

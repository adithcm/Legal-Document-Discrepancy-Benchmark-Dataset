            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within fourteen (14) days after Theismann’s receipt thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within two (2) days after Theismann’s receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval timeframe from 14 days to 2 days places an unreasonable burden on Theismann, potentially conflicting with standard business practice expectations and principles of fair dealing, which could be viewed as legally problematic, depending on the jurisdiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts principles of reasonable time for review and fair dealing implied in contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Payment of the Royalty shall be made no later than 90 days after the termination of the preceding full calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the payment timeframe to 90 days may violate state wage payment laws in states like California or New York that require more prompt payment, thus creating an inconsistency with regulatory standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state wage payment laws (e.g., California Labor Code, New York Labor Law).",

                "explanation": "Reducing the record-keeping period to six months contradicts standard business practice expectations and potentially statutes of limitations, thus limiting Theismann's ability to audit and enforce the terms of the agreement.  This creates a legal contradiction by impeding Theismann's ability to pursue legal action within the typical statute of limitations for contract disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Such invoice must be paid by the customer within 90 days of the date on which the invoice is issued.",
                "explanation": "This change violates the South African law regarding payment terms. According to the South African National Payment System Act, unduly extended payment terms that disadvantage smaller suppliers can be considered an unfair business practice. While 45 days might be acceptable, extending it to 90 days, especially for smaller businesses that depend on timely payments, introduces a potential legal challenge under unfair trading practice regulations.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year may be deemed insufficient and unreasonable under Spanish law, particularly concerning trade secrets or sensitive business information. Spanish law protects trade secrets and confidential information, and a one-year period might not provide adequate protection, especially if the information has a longer commercial lifespan, potentially leading to legal challenges regarding the enforceability of this clause.",

                "explanation": "This timeline perturbation is legally inconsistent. The original contract provides a 30-day window for the supervision commission to resolve conflicts, which is a reasonable timeframe. However, shortening this period to just five days is impractical and conflicts with standard dispute resolution practices under Spanish law. Legal disputes often require thorough investigation and deliberation, and a mere five days may not be sufficient for a fair and comprehensive assessment, thus undermining the enforceability of the dispute resolution mechanism.",

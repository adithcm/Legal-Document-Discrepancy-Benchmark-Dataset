Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within ten (10) days of the end of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment).",

Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period (five (5) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within five (5) days of the end of such fifteen (15) day period (five (5) day period for non-payment).",

The modified text shortens these periods to 15 days and 5 days, respectively. This creates a legal contradiction because many jurisdictions require a longer cure period to allow the breaching party adequate time to remedy the default, especially in significant commercial agreements. A shorter period may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable.",

The modified text reduces the record-keeping period to one year and the advance notice for audits to five days, while the audit should be limited to records for any year ending not more than three months prior to the date of the written notice. This is an unreasonably short period and could be deemed unenforceable or a breach of good faith, especially given the complexity of international sales and royalty calculations, and given that Xencor should have a certain level of ability to audit all the records to make sure their royalties are paid accurately.",

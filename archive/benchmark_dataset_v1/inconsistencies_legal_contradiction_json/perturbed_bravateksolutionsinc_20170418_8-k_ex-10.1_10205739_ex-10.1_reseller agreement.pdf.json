            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Company shall notify reseller of any changes, modifications or the discontinuation of any of the Company Products within thirty (30) days.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Company shall notify reseller of any changes, modifications or the discontinuation of any of the Company Products within fifteen (15) days.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the notification period for product changes to 15 days, potentially conflicting with reasonable notice periods required under Virginia law (where the contract is governed) or general contract law principles. Courts often imply a reasonable timeframe for notification based on the nature of the changes and potential impact on the reseller.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract; failure to provide reasonable notice",
                "location": "Section 4"

                "original_text": "Referral Fees will be paid within thirty (30) days of the collection of receivables from the Registered Referral.",
                "changed_text": "Referral Fees will be paid within ninety (90) days of the collection of receivables from the Registered Referral.",
                "explanation": "Extended payment terms for referral fees to 90 days may conflict with prompt payment laws, especially if the Reseller is a small business. While Virginia law doesn't have a specific prompt payment act for private contracts, excessively delayed payments can be considered a breach of contract if it imposes undue hardship.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract; delayed payments",
                "location": "Section 6"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",

                "changed_text": "For a Registered Opportunity where the customer purchases from Reseller, payment will be made by Reseller to Company within 60 days of receipt of payment (paid when paid).",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment term from Reseller to Company for Registered Opportunities to 60 days. This might be considered an unreasonably long delay, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under contract law, especially if the Company relies on prompt payments to maintain its operations. Additionally, such a substantial delay could be viewed as unconscionable.",

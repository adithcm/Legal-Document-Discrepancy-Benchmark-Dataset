                "original_text": "HCI shall pay MLX a guaranteed fixed sum of [*] US per annum during the Initial Term of this Agreement to be paid out as a monthly payment of [*] US (the \"Monthly Payment\"). This Monthly Payment shall be due by the 10th day of each month",
                "changed_text": "HCI shall pay MLX a guaranteed fixed sum of [*] US per annum during the Initial Term of this Agreement to be paid out as a monthly payment of [*] US (the \"Monthly Payment\"). This Monthly Payment shall be due by the 60th day of each month",
                "explanation": "By changing the payment due date to the 60th day of each month, the agreement now contradicts standard payment terms and potentially violates laws related to timely payments, depending on the specific jurisdiction and industry standards. Many jurisdictions have laws requiring payments to be made within a reasonable timeframe, typically much shorter than 60 days.",

Any such audit shall take place upon not less than seven (7) days advance written notice, during normal business hours of normal business days and at reasonable intervals.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party shall have the right from time to time to audit and make extracts of the books and records of the other, insofar as said books or records pertain to the terms of this Agreement. Any such audit shall take place upon not less than one (1) days advance written notice, during normal business hours of normal business days and at reasonable intervals.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the advance written notice for audits to one day may be deemed unreasonable and contradict standard business practices and legal norms. Some jurisdictions have laws or regulations regarding the minimum notice period required for audits to ensure fairness and allow sufficient time for preparation.",

In other instances, MediaLinx shall be entitled to use or publicly disclose the data collected subject to privacy guidelines noted above.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the restriction period for using user data to one month could conflict with data protection laws that require a more extended period to ensure user privacy and prevent misuse of data, especially considering the sensitive nature of health information. This may be seen as an unreasonably short time frame to protect user data.",

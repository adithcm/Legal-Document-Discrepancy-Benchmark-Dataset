                "original_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor’s quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor’s quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps within ten (10) days to cure such noncompliance.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a cure period of sixty (60) days for noncompliance with quality standards. Reducing this cure period to ten (10) days may be deemed unreasonable and could be considered a breach of contract if the Licensee cannot reasonably cure the noncompliance within that shorter timeframe. This introduces potential litigation risks and contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in performing their contractual obligations. Many states require reasonableness in contract performance.",

                "changed_text": "For six (6) months following termination of this Agreement, the Licensee may, at its sole discretion, specify on some public-facing materials that the Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 24-month disclosure period post-termination. Reducing this to 6 months and making it discretionary significantly weakens the protection afforded to the Licensor's brand and could be seen as deceptive marketing if the Licensee continues to benefit from the association with the Licensor's brand beyond a reasonable transition period. This is because it fails to provide consumers sufficient time to recognize that the companies are no longer affiliated. Consumer Protection Laws often require clarity to avoid confusion.",

The parties unconditionally and irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of New York and waive any objection with respect thereto, for the purpose of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of conflict of laws. All disputes will be settled by binding arbitration in a location of the Licensor’s choosing.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New York to Delaware and mandating binding arbitration with the venue selected by the Licensor may be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, especially if the Licensee has no connection to Delaware. The original clause explicitly establishes jurisdiction in New York, therefore this would be an issue. Furthermore, removing the New York jurisdiction might disadvantage the Licensee if they are located in a different state and must now travel to Delaware for legal proceedings and the selected location.",

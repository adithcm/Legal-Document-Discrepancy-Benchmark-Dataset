A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”).\nEach capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA.",
                "changed_text": "This Schedule (“Schedule”) is made as of the effective date set forth above to that Software License, Customization, and Maintenance Agreement,\nby and between Cardlytics, Inc. (“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”). Any disputes arising from this agreement must be submitted to arbitration within 30 days of the event giving rise to the dispute. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces a clause requiring arbitration within 30 days of a dispute. This contradicts the general statute of limitations for contract disputes, which is often several years, depending on the state. Limiting the dispute resolution to 30 days is also unreasonably short, potentially denying parties adequate time to prepare their cases, thereby hindering their legal rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "State statutes of limitations for contract disputes (e.g., in Georgia, where Cardlytics is located, the statute of limitations for breach of contract is typically 6 years). Also, potentially conflicts with principles of fairness and due process in dispute resolution.",

Failure to report any defects within the 10 day period means Bank of America has accepted the Offer Placement System Software as is and has waived all rights to any claims relating to the software defects. The attached Schedule [A] is hereby incorporated into the SLCMA describing the Offer Placement System Software for use by Bank of America.",
                "explanation": "Limiting the inspection period to only 10 days and waiving all future claims of defect if not reported within that period creates an unconscionable contract that could contradict state law.

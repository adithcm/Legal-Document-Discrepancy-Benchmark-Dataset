                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ABG shall respond to each initial request for Approval from PAPA JOHN’S (“First Request”) within three (3) days of ABG’s receipt of such request (“Approval Window”); provided, however that ABG’s silence or failure to respond to the First Request prior to the expiration of the Approval Window shall be deemed ABG’s disapproval of the Materials contained in the First Request for Approval.",
                "changed_text": "ABG shall respond to each initial request for Approval from PAPA JOHN’S (“First Request”) within one (1) day of ABG’s receipt of such request (“Approval Window”); provided, however that ABG’s silence or failure to respond to the First Request prior to the expiration of the Approval Window shall be deemed ABG’s disapproval of the Materials contained in the First Request for Approval.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the response time for approval requests from three days to one day. Depending on the specific industry and the complexity of the materials requiring approval, this timeframe may be unreasonably short, hindering PAPA JOHN'S ability to meet marketing deadlines. This can also be seen as a violation of good faith and fair dealing, especially if ABG consistently fails to respond within the shortened timeframe, effectively blocking PAPA JOHN'S marketing efforts.",

                "changed_text": "PAPA JOHN’S breaches any material term of this Agreement, which breach PAPA JOHN’S fails to cure within ten (10) days after PAPA JOHN’S receipt of ABG’s written notice of such breach, it being understood such period shall be two (2) business days with respect to the payment of any monies",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for breaches of contract, especially regarding payments, to two business days may be considered unreasonable and could be seen as a violation of good faith, potentially conflicting with state laws requiring reasonable opportunity to cure defaults. This could lead to premature termination of the agreement due to minor or easily rectified payment delays.",

                "original_text": "Within five (5) business days of the date on which this Agreement is fully executed, PAPA JOHN’S shall submit to ABG a certificate of insurance naming each of ABG, CELEBRITY and Authentic Brands Group, LLC as additional insureds (“COI”), which COI, or a renewal or replacement thereof, shall remain in force at all times during the Insurance Period, and shall require the insurer to provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to PAPA JOHN’S, and all additional insureds, of any termination, cancellation or modification thereof.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the time to submit the certificate of insurance to one business day and the notice period for termination/cancellation of insurance to ten days can create significant issues. Obtaining a COI within one day might be impossible, and ten days' notice of cancellation is insufficient under standard insurance regulations and commercial practices, potentially violating implied duties of reasonable notice and ability to maintain adequate coverage.",

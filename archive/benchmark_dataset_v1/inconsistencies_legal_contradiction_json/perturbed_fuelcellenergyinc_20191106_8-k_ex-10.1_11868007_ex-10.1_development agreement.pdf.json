                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If FCE does not respond within thirty (30) days from ExxonMobil seeking such consent, then ExxonMobil may proceed with such filing.",
                "changed_text": "If FCE does not respond within ten (10) days from ExxonMobil seeking such consent, then ExxonMobil may proceed with such filing.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the response time for FCE to review patent applications containing their confidential information from 30 days to 10 days could be considered unreasonable and not provide sufficient time for adequate review, potentially violating fiduciary duty principles or implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, depending on the jurisdiction. This introduces a timeline that is legally questionable regarding adequate opportunity to protect confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential breach of fiduciary duty, depending on specific state laws regarding contract interpretation and confidential information.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from 30 days to 60 days could create a legal contradiction if it violates prompt payment laws in Connecticut (where FCE is located) or New York (governing law). Many states have prompt payment laws that require payments to contractors and subcontractors within a specified timeframe (often 30 days) to avoid penalties and interest charges. Extending the payment period might breach these statutes, thus rendering this clause unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Connecticut or New York Prompt Payment Laws (hypothetical violation depending on specific statute details and applicability).",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for amicable resolution from 60 to 30 days may contradict principles of good faith negotiation, especially if the complexity of potential disputes requires more time for resolution. It could also be challenged if considered unconscionable or against public policy by unduly restricting the opportunity for parties to resolve disagreements before resorting to arbitration, particularly in complex technical or commercial disputes.",

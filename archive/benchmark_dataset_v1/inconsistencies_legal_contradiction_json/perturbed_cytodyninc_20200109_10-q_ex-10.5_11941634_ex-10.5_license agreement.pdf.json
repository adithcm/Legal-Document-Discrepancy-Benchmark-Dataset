Vyera shall pay all amounts due to CytoDyn with respect to Net Sales by Vyera or its Affiliates for such Calendar Quarter at the time of the submission of such quarterly report.",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days following the end of each Calendar Quarter after the First Commercial Sale of each Licensed Product in the Territory, Vyera shall provide CytoDyn with a report in a form reasonably acceptable to CytoDyn containing the following information for the applicable Calendar Quarter for such Licensed Product: (a) the amount of gross sales of the Licensed Product in the Territory; (b) an itemized calculation of Net Sales in the Territory showing reasonably detailed deductions; provided for in the definition of “Net Sales”; (c) a reasonably detailed calculation of the royalty payment due on such sales; (d) an accounting of the number of units of the Licensed Product sold; and (e) the application of the reduction, if any, made in accordance with the terms of Section 8.7. Vyera shall pay all amounts due to CytoDyn with respect to Net Sales by Vyera or its Affiliates for such Calendar Quarter within 180 days of the submission of such quarterly report.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the payment term from 45 days after the end of each quarter to 180 days introduces a legal contradiction. Many states have prompt payment laws that mandate payments be made within a specified timeframe, often much shorter than 180 days. This extended payment period could violate those laws, particularly if the agreement doesn't provide sufficient justification for the delay.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to any Know-How or trade secret within such Confidential Information shall survive such ten (10) year period for so long as such Confidential Information remains Know-How and/or protected as a trade secret under Applicable Law.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to any Know-How or trade secret within such Confidential Information shall not survive such one (1) year period regardless of whether such Confidential Information remains Know-How and/or protected as a trade secret under Applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year contradicts established trade secret law. Trade secrets are protected as long as they remain secret and provide a competitive advantage. Limiting the confidentiality obligation to one year, even for information that remains a trade secret, makes the contract unenforceable and contradicts fundamental principles of trade secret protection under both state and federal law.",

                "explanation": "Providing only 5 days to cure a material breach is unreasonable and may contradict legal standards of fairness and good faith, particularly in complex commercial agreements. Courts often require a reasonable opportunity to cure before termination, and 5 days may be deemed insufficient, making the termination clause potentially unenforceable.",

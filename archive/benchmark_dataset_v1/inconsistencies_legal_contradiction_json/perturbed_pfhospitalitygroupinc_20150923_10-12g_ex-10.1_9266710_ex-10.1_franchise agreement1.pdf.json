                "original_text": "3.5. Due Date for Payment. Your Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions are due by the first (1st) day after the end of each\nPeriod (or the next business day if the first day is a Sunday or federal holiday) (as of the Agreement Date, the due date is Monday of each week). You must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement or, if no time is specified, such amounts are due upon receipt of an invoice from us.",

You must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement or, if no time is specified, such amounts are due 60 days after receipt of an invoice from us.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts standard franchise practices that require more frequent royalty payments to ensure franchisor cash flow. The modified version extends payment deadlines significantly, potentially impacting the franchisor's financial stability. Additionally, the change introduces non-compliance with standard accounting practices regarding revenue recognition and payment schedules.",

Reports and Financial Statements.\n8.2.1 You agree to submit financial and operational reports and records and documents to us at the times and in the manner specified in the Manual or other written instructions. You agree to submit, (a) within twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar month, a\nbalance sheet and income statement, and (b) within ninety (90) days of the end of each fiscal year, an annual balance sheet and income statement. Upon our request, each such financial statement must accompanied by an unqualified review opinion from an independent certified public\naccountant acceptable to us. You or the Operating Principal must certify that the income statement and balance sheet are correct and complete and that they have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the US (or, if we request, international financial\nreporting standards if, by then, IFRS have been adopted in the US). You must also submit to us a complete photocopy of the Franchised Business’ annual federal and state income tax returns when you file such reports with the appropriate tax authorities.",
                "changed_text": "8.2. Reports and Financial Statements.\n8.2.1 You agree to submit financial and operational reports and records and documents to us only when we request them. There is no obligation to provide routine or scheduled reports. Upon our specific ad-hoc request, you agree to submit, (a) within one hundred eighty (180) days after we ask, a balance sheet and income statement, and (b) within three hundred sixty-five (365) days if we ask for an annual balance sheet and income statement. Any financial statement doesn't need to be accompanied by an unqualified review opinion from an independent certified public accountant. Neither you nor the Operating Principal needs to certify that the income statement and balance sheet are correct or complete. You are not required to submit to us a complete photocopy of the Franchised Business’ annual federal and state income tax returns.",
                "explanation": "The modified text significantly weakens the reporting requirements, contradicting standard franchise agreement terms for financial oversight. Delaying the balance sheet and income statement by 180 days (after request) and 365 days (after request for annual statements), removing the requirement for CPA review, and removing the certification requirement creates inconsistency. Franchisor's ability to monitor franchise performance and enforce compliance are seriously limited.",

Any and all claims and actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the relationship between\nyou and us, or your operation of the Restaurant, brought by any party hereto against the other, must be commenced within one (1) year from the\noccurrence of the facts giving rise to such claim or action, or, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed by all parties, such claim or action will be\nirrevocably barred.",

                "explanation": "The modification reduces the statute of limitations for claims from one year to 90 days. This introduces a legal contradiction because many state laws provide for longer statutes of limitations for contract disputes. By shortening the claim period, the contract could be considered unconscionable or unenforceable in some jurisdictions, and could conflict with state franchise laws designed to protect franchisees' rights.",

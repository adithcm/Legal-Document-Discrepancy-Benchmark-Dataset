Service shall be deemed conclusively made (a) at the time of service, if personally served; (b) twenty-four (24) hours (exclusive of weekends and national holidays) after deposit in the United States mail, properly addressed and postage prepaid, if served by Express Mail; (c) upon the earlier of actual receipt or three (3) calendar days after deposit in the United States mail, properly addressed and postage prepaid, return receipt requested, if served by certified mail; (d) twenty-four (24) hours after delivery by the party giving the notice, statement or demand if by private overnight delivery; and (e) at the time of transmission by facsimile, if such transmission occurs prior to 5:00 p.m. on a business day and a copy of such notice is mailed within twenty-four (24) hours after the transmission.",

Service shall be deemed conclusively made (a) at the time of service, if personally served; (b) five (5) business days after deposit in the United States mail, properly addressed and postage prepaid, if served by regular mail; (c) at the time of transmission by email, with no requirement for confirmation of receipt.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified methods of notice that ensure tracking and confirmation of receipt, crucial in legal contexts. The modified version introduces less reliable methods (regular mail, email without receipt confirmation), contradicting legal norms that require reasonable assurance of notice delivery, especially where time-sensitive obligations are involved. These modifications create potential disputes over whether notice was properly given, increasing legal risk.",

If any such default is not cured within the specified time, or such longer period as applicable law may require, we shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination to you. You shall be in default pursuant to this Section 10.3 for failure to substantially comply with any of the requirements imposed by this Agreement, as it may from time to time reasonably be modified or supplemented by the Manuals, or your failure to carry out the terms of this Agreement in good faith.",
                "changed_text": "10.3 Termination with Notice and Opportunity to Cure\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 of this Agreement, you shall have five (5) days after your receipt from us of a written notice of default within which to remedy any default under this Agreement and to provide evidence thereof to us. If any such default is not cured within the specified time, we shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination to you.

                "explanation": "The original contract provides a 30-day cure period, which aligns with common legal standards. Reducing this to 5 days creates a legal contradiction because such a short period might be deemed unreasonable, especially for complex breaches. Many jurisdictions require a 'reasonable' opportunity to cure, and 5 days is unlikely to meet this standard, particularly given the potential for disputes regarding the definition and impact of defaults within the agreement.",

You shall expend not less than $5,000 each month on such Solicitation Advertising.  To protect the Proprietary Marks and our goodwill in the industry, you must submit samples of all proposed Solicitation Advertising materials to us at least fifteen (15) days before any use of the same.  If we do not disapprove the proposed Solicitation Advertising materials within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the same, you may use the proposed Solicitation Advertising materials as submitted to us; provided, however, that if such Solicitation Advertising is required to be submitted to a government agency, you shall so submit such materials to the applicable government agency and shall not use such materials until the materials are approved or disapproved or if the use of the materials otherwise become permissible under law, such as if notice of disapproval is not received from a governmental agency within a stated period of time prescribed by law.

                "explanation": "The original requires a 15-day review period for ad materials which may align with industry standards and provide reasonable time for assessment. Reducing this to 24 hours contradicts legal principles of reasonableness, especially since franchise laws require proper representation.

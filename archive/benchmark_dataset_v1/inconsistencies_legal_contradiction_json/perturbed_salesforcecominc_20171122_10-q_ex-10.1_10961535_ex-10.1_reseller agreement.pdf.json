If such period is\ngreater than fifteen (15) business days then this Sub-Reseller Agreement shall be deemed null and void and to be of no effect.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that if the dates of the parties' signatures are separated by a period greater than 10 business days, the agreement is null and void. The modified contract states that if such period is greater than 15 business days, the agreement is null and void, but also that dates of signatures cannot be separated by a period of time greater than thirty (30) business days. This introduces an inconsistency, as it stipulates one condition stating it is null and void after 15 days while simultaneously stating that it is acceptable if no greater than 30 days.",

                "changed_text": "Reseller must ensure that Sub-Reseller complies with only some of the terms of the Agreement at their discretion. Any breach by Sub-Reseller of the Agreement will be deemed a breach by Reseller only if Salesforce decides to enforce that clause.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty regarding the sub-reseller's obligations. The original text mandates full compliance. The modified text allows partial compliance \"at their discretion\", and only enforces breach if Salesforce decides to enforce it. This contradicts standard contract law principles requiring clear obligations for all parties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Clear and Unambiguous Terms. The ambiguity introduced regarding compliance and breach enforcement makes the contractual obligation unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Entire Agreement. This Sub-Reseller Agreement contains most of the agreement between the Parties, but does not supersede prior oral agreements unless those agreements conflict with the terms herein.",
                "explanation": "An entire agreement clause is meant to ensure that the written document is the complete and final agreement. The modified text suggests that prior oral agreements might still be valid and enforceable, contradicting the purpose of an entire agreement clause. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual terms of the agreement and could conflict with the parol evidence rule in contract law.",

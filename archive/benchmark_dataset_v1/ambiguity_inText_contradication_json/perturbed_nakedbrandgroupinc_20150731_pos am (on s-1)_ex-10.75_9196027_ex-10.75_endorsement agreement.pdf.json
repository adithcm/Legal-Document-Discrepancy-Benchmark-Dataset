The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period of four (4) years, commencing on the Effective Date, which term may be extended for up to three (3) years by written agreement of both Parties prior to the expiration date of the initial term or any extension thereof (collectively, the “Term”). Each twelve-month period beginning on the Effective Date shall be known as a “Contract Year.” In the event that either Wade or Naked wishes to extend the Term of the Agreement as contemplated above, it shall provide the other Party with written notice at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term. The other Party will then have a period of fourteen (14) days from the date of the notice to indicate whether it also desires to extend the Term, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and if no such indication is made, the other Party will be deemed to have declined the offer to extend. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wade agrees that for a period of ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term (unless the Agreement is terminated by Wade as permitted hereunder), Naked shall have the exclusive right to negotiate for continued endorsement by Athlete of the Naked Products. For a period of six (6) months at the end of the Term (the “Sell-off Period”); provided that the Agreement was not terminated by Wade as permitted herein, Naked will have the right to continue to sell the Wade Products (defined below) for which orders have already been placed at the end of the Term on the terms and conditions herein.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Term' is originally defined as the initial four-year period, potentially extended by three years. However, by changing the negotiation period from 90 to 30 days and the sell-off period from 6 to 12 months, we create a conflict. Is 'Term' truly the initial + extension period, or is it also affected by these modified clauses? This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the length of Naked's exclusive negotiation rights and the duration of the sell-off period.",

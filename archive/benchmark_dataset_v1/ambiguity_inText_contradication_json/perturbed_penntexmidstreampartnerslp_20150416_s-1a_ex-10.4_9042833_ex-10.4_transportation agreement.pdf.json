                "changed_text": "“Customer” shall mean any entity that has expressed interest in Transporter’s service.",
                "explanation": "The original definition refers to the preamble, which identifies a specific LLC. The modified definition broadens this to include any entity showing interest, creating uncertainty about who qualifies as a ‘Customer’ under different sections of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "“Force Majeure” as used herein shall mean acts of God; strikes, lockouts, or other industrial disturbances; conditions arising from a change in governmental laws, orders, rules, or regulations; acts of public enemy; wars; blockades; insurrections; riots; epidemics; landslides; lightning; earthquakes; fires; storms; floods; washouts; arrests and restraints of governments and people; civil disturbances; explosions; breakage or accident to machinery or lines of pipe; the necessity for making repairs, tests, alterations, or performing maintenance to machinery or lines of pipe; scheduled maintenance; freezing of wells or lines of pipe; partial or entire failure of wells, processing, or gasification and gas manufacturing facilities; orders or directives of, or proceedings initiated by, any Governmental Authority; and any other causes, whether of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise, not within the control of the Party claiming relief hereunder, and which by the exercise of due diligence, such Party is unable to prevent or overcome.",
                "changed_text": "“Force Majeure” as used herein shall mean acts of God. For avoidance of doubt, Force Majeure events only extends to acts of God, specifically severe weather and geological disasters. Any other events, like strikes or governmental regulations, won't be considered a Force Majeure.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a comprehensive list of events that qualify as 'Force Majeure.' The modified version drastically reduces this list, limiting it to only acts of God. This creates a direct contradiction, leading to disputes over whether specific events (e.g., government regulations) excuse performance under the contract.",

This Agreement may not be assigned, disposed of, alienated or otherwise transferred by either Party, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as provided below.",
                "changed_text": "Restrictions on Assignment. This Agreement may be assigned, disposed of, alienated or otherwise transferred by either Party, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to the other party, and there is no requirement to seek consent or provide information to the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original text restricts assignment without consent, while the modified text allows unrestricted assignment. This introduces a significant contradiction regarding a party's ability to transfer their contractual obligations and rights.",

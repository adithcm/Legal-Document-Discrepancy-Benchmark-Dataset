                "original_text": "Section 4.1. Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues in perpetuity, unless termination occurs pursuant to Sections 4.2 through 4.4.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.1. Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for a period of five (5) years, unless terminated earlier pursuant to Sections 4.2 through 4.4. After the initial five-year term, the Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods, unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict regarding the term of the agreement. Section 4.1 initially states the agreement continues in perpetuity, but the modified version limits the initial term to five years with potential renewals, creating uncertainty about the actual duration.",

                "changed_text": "Section 3.2. Prior Written Approval. Licensee shall submit all proposed uses of the Brand in marketing materials exceeding $10,000 in cost to Licensor for prior written approval. For other uses, Licensee shall provide Licensor with a report of all uses on a quarterly basis.",
                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity around which uses of the Brand require prior written approval. The original text required approval for *all* uses, while the modified text only requires it for specific marketing materials and introduces a reporting requirement for others. This creates potential disputes over what constitutes a 'marketing material exceeding $10,000' and whether other uses are implicitly approved if not explicitly rejected in the quarterly report.",

                "changed_text": "Section 4.2. Termination for Convenience. Licensor reserves the right to terminate this Agreement upon ninety (90) days written notice, but only in the event of a material adverse change in Licensee's business operations that directly impacts the value or reputation of the Brand. Such termination must be approved by a senior executive of Licensor.",
                "explanation": "This creates a conflict regarding the conditions for termination for convenience. The original agreement allowed immediate termination for any reason, while the revised agreement introduces limitations: a 90-day notice period, the requirement of a material adverse change, and approval by a senior executive. This makes it unclear under what circumstances Licensor can terminate the agreement, potentially leading to legal disputes.",

The changed text softens these requirements, for example, stating 'using reasonable efforts to ensure that the design and functionality of the Application System generally aligns with the Client’s specifications', 'Devote reasonable time, energy, and ability to the performance of its duties hereunder as may be practically necessary to provide the Services in a timely and productive manner' and 'Perform the Services in a workmanlike manner and with ordinary diligence and skill'. This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of effort required by the Developer. If another section requires strict adherence to specifications, this creates a conflict.",

Vendor completes Delivery of Material or Completion of Services: (i) in the case of any Cell Site (and all Material and Services incorporated therein or related thereto) upon Location Acceptance, and (ii) in the case of delivery of Material or Services that are required to be delivered prior to or following Location Acceptance, (A) upon AT&T’s possession of the Material if Vendor is not required to provide additional Services, such as installation, (B) upon completing such additional Services, if Vendor is required to provide such Services in connection with providing Material, or (C) for Services, upon completing the provision of Services. Notwithstanding the above, Delivery and Completion shall not be deemed to have occurred until Vendor causes the Material and Services to strictly conform to the Specifications and in the case of any Cell Site, Location Acceptance has occurred.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for strict conformance to specifications for Delivery and Completion, while also stating that Location Acceptance can occur even if specifications are not met, there is an in-text contradiction. The original definition emphasizes strict adherence, but the modified version allows for Delivery and Completion even with non-conformance, creating potential confusion about when contractual obligations are fulfilled.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise directed by AT&T in writing' introduces a contradiction. The initial part of the definition implies that specifications are a fixed set of requirements. However, the added clause gives AT&T the power to override these specifications, leading to potential disputes about which specifications are actually binding and enforceable at any given time. This creates uncertainty in contract enforcement.",

Therefore, Vendor understands generally that AT&T’s business requires prompt Delivery of Material and provision of Services by the specified Delivery Dates. Furthermore, the Parties agree that dates for Delivery of Material and Services are firm subject to any Excusable Delay, time is of the essence, and, subject to any Excusable Delay, Vendor will complete such Delivery in strict conformance with the Specifications.",

Therefore, Vendor understands generally that AT&T’s business requires prompt Delivery of Material and provision of Services by the specified Delivery Dates. Furthermore, the Parties agree that dates for Delivery of Material and Services are target dates only and not binding in any way, even in the absence of an Excusable Delay; time is *not* of the essence, and Vendor will make good faith effort to complete such Delivery in conformance with the Specifications.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text by stating that delivery dates are not firm ('target dates only'), time is not of the essence, and removes the strict conformance requirement. Originally, time was of the essence and deliveries were to be strictly in conformance with the specifications. This creates ambiguity regarding the importance and enforceability of delivery dates, and the standard to which delivery will occur. This in-text contradiction may lead to legal disputes.",

Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially\nReasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s)\nwho are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii)\nallocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",
                "changed_text": "1.21 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective (e.g.,\nDevelopment Activities and Commercialization hereunder), the level of efforts consistent with the desire to complete the tasks with available budget and basic resources, and considering the other objectives from a company-wide view. The efforts do not require special investments or cause material harm to either the party involved or the project objectives. Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially\nReasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s)\nwho are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii)\nallocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by defining Commercially Reasonable Efforts in a less stringent way. The original definition includes a comprehensive list of factors including market potential, profitability, and patent position, while the modified definition prioritizes budget constraints and avoids material harm. This creates uncertainty in enforcement because it's unclear whether a party's actions should be judged against the standard of a well-resourced company aggressively pursuing a valuable product, or a company simply trying to get by with minimal investment.",

                "explanation": "By negating the inclusion of release process in quality control, it creates a contradiction that leads to uncertain enforcement. The original section clearly includes release, but the altered section excludes release. This introduces ambiguity because later sections of the contract might assume that Manufacture encompasses the release of the drug, creating uncertainty over what aspects of Manufacturing Aimmune is responsible for.",

                "explanation": "The change of *including* to *excluding* of the pricing approvals will cause contradiction. The original Regulatory Approval section includes pricing approvals, but the modified section excludes pricing approvals. Since pricing approvals have a big impact on commercialization, the contradiction has impacts to other parts of the contract too.",

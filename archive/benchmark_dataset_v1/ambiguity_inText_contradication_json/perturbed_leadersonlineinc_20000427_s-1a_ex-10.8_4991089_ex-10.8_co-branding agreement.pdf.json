Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a Party, any\nindividual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under\ncommon control with such Party.  For purposes of this definition, \"control\"\nmeans the direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting\npower of a Party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such Party.",

Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a Party, any\nindividual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under\ncommon control with such Party. For purposes of this definition, 'control'\nmeans the direct or indirect ownership of at least 25% of the outstanding voting\npower of a Party, or the right to significantly influence the policy decisions of such Party.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' is modified by changing the 'control' definition from 50% ownership to 25% ownership. Additionally, 'right to control the policy decisions' is changed to 'right to significantly influence the policy decisions'. This creates an internal inconsistency because another section might rely on the original 50% threshold for determining affiliate status. This can lead to different interpretations of obligations related to affiliates.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces several conflicting elements. Firstly, it allows LeadersOnline to provide candidate information to 'trusted third-party partners' without consent, contradicting the original restriction. Secondly, it relaxes the contact limitations, allowing up to three contacts per month instead of one per quarter. Thirdly, it changes the obligation to return information upon termination to retaining it, and finally it says that LeadersOnline's privacy policy dictates the information, not VerticalNet's. This creates ambiguity regarding data privacy and the obligations of LeadersOnline.",

Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written\nnotice to the other Party in the event of any material breach of a term of this\nAgreement by such other Party that remains uncured 30 days after notice of such\nbreach was received by such other Party or, if the breach is not reasonably\ncapable of cure within 30 days, such longer period, not to exceed 60 days, so\nlong as the cure is commenced within the 30-day period and thereafter is\ndiligently prosecuted to completion as soon as possible and in any event within\n60 days.",

Furthermore, VerticalNet can terminate this agreement with no prior notice if LeadersOnline is suspected of failing to provide a product of reasonable quality.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the termination conditions. The cure period for a breach is shortened from 30/60 days to 10/20 days, making termination easier. Additionally, VerticalNet is granted the right to terminate with no notice if LeadersOnline fails to provide product of reasonable quality, regardless of a cure period. This introduces a subjective criteria for termination and also conflicts with the earlier part of the section.",

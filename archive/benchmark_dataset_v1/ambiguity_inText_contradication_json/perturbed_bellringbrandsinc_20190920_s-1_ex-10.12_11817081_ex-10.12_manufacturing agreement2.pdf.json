The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period\ncommencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval\nof that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December\n31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a “Contract Period”).",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall endeavor to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for\nthe twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period\ncommencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval\nof that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. However, Premier's purchase obligation for the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December\n31, 2022, is subject to market conditions and Premier will make a good faith effort to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a “Contract Period”).",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be required to purchase' to 'shall endeavor to purchase' weakens the purchase obligation and creates ambiguity. Also, adding 'However, Premier's purchase obligation for the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, is subject to market conditions and Premier will make a good faith effort to purchase' introduces another ambiguity by making the six-month purchase agreement subject to market conditions, which may conflict with the previously defined MAOV requirements. This creates a contradiction as the first sentence implies a firm obligation while the second implies a flexible one.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that 'all other terms... shall remain in full force and effect,' providing certainty to the agreement's continuity. Changing this to 'most other terms...shall remain in full force' introduces ambiguity by not specifying which terms may change and creates an exception that is unspecified. Adding 'Heritage reserves the right to renegotiate terms if market conditions significantly change' creates a further contradiction by undermining the 'full force and effect' clause. It is now unclear which terms are firm and which can be renegotiated, especially as 'market conditions' are undefined, allowing for subjective interpretation and potential disputes.",

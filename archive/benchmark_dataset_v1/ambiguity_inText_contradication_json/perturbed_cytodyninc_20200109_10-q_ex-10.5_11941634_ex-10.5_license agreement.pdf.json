The modification contradicts this by stating 'minimal' good faith and 'reduced' efforts, thereby introducing a contradiction on what constitutes Commercial Reasonable Efforts.",

                "explanation": "The original section grants CytoDyn complete control over trademark selection and trade dress. The added clauses give Vyera approval rights, creating an ambiguity on who ultimately decides on these elements. Who is responsible in case they do not agree? The original says that CytoDyn is the one who selects, now it depends on Vyera since they should approve. This may confuse the contract enforcements.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states an obligation to assign rights. The modification weakens this by using 'may', implying it's not always mandatory. This conflicts with other sections that may assume a clear assignment of rights, creating uncertainty. The original clause grants Vyera the rights to pay all such remuneration due to such inventors. The new clause weakens this rights by implying there will be negotiations about how much should be paid and if it should be done.",

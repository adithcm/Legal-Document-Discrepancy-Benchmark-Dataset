Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory without the prior express written consent of Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not use the Licensed Mark for any purpose outside the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",

                "explanation": "The original text restricts the use of the Licensed Mark to 'solely and exclusively' being a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with marketing investment services. The modified text broadens this by removing 'solely and exclusively' and changing 'marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee' to 'in connection with the operation of its business', this expands the permitted uses, potentially conflicting with other clauses defining acceptable use and creating ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement expires if 'the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve'. The modified text removes 'or one of its affiliates', narrowing the condition for expiration. This creates a contradiction because, under the modified text, if an affiliate of the Investment Advisor is still serving as investment advisor, the agreement could be argued to remain in effect, even if the original Investment Advisor ceases to serve. This ambiguity impacts the termination rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that no third party *other than* Investment Advisor is intended to receive any legal or equitable right. By removing the phrase 'other than Investment Advisor', the revised clause implies that *no* third party, including the Investment Advisor itself, is intended to be a beneficiary. This directly contradicts the first part of the sentence which explicitly names Investment Advisor as a third-party beneficiary.",

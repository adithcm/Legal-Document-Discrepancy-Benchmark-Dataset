A Person will be regarded as in “control” (including, with correlative\nmeaning, the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) of another Person if it (a) owns or controls at least fifty percent (50%) of the\nequity securities of the subject Person entitled to vote in the election of directors, or (b) possesses, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or\ncause the direction of the management or policies of any such Person (whether through ownership of securities or other ownership interests, by\ncontract or otherwise).",

                "explanation": "Section 5.6 generally states MMT will cooperate to meet safety reporting requirements. However, the added last sentence limits MMT's responsibility to Tier 1 Countries. This creates a contradiction as Schedule 3 implies a global reporting requirement, while Section 5.6 now restricts MMT's role, leading to uncertainty about who is responsible for reporting in non-Tier 1 countries.",

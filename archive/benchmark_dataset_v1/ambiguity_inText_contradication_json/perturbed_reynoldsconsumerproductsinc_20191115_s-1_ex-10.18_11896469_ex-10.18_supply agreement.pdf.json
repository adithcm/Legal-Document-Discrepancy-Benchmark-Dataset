This Agreement will apply to all products sold by Seller to Buyer, and all products purchased by Buyer from Seller, during the Term unless the Parties expressly agree that this Agreement will not apply to a particular type of transaction in a separate written document signed by an officer of each Party. This Agreement will not require Seller to sell any type or quantity of a product to Buyer, nor will this Agreement required Buyer to purchase any type or quantity of a product from Seller, except as expressly provided by the Parties in a Purchase Schedule. The phrase “Purchase Schedule” will mean a written supplement to this Agreement signed by an officer of each Party which references this Agreement and which identities, among other terms and conditions, the specific types and quantities of products that will be purchased and sold by the Parties on terms and conditions in the schedule, the specifications for the identified products, the duration of the commitment period during which the Parties will be obligated to purchase and sell the identified products on the terms and conditions in the schedule, the prices of the identified products, any mechanisms for adjusting the prices of the identified products over the commitment period, and the facilities at which the identified products will be manufactured, stored and delivered by Seller. The Parties may add terms and conditions to, and amend the terms and conditions of, this Agreement in a Purchase Schedule, but any additional and amended terms and conditions in a Purchase Schedule supplementing and modifying this Agreement will only apply the specific products identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration.",

This Agreement will apply to all products sold by Seller to Buyer, and all products purchased by Buyer from Seller, during the Term, irrespective of any separate written agreement, unless explicitly stated otherwise within the Purchase Schedule itself.

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement only applies if not contradicted by another written agreement and that no sale/purchase is required unless stated in a Purchase Schedule. The modified text contradicts this by stating the agreement always applies unless the Purchase Schedule says otherwise, and the Purchase Schedule creates a purchase/sale requirement. This creates uncertainty regarding the scope and obligations of the agreement.",

The Parties will attempt to select a mutually acceptable JAMS mediator within ten (10) days of the notice requesting mediation. The mediation will be held in Lake County or Cook County, Illinois within thirty (30) days of the notice requesting mediation before a JAMS mediator and in compliance with JAMS mediation guidelines. Each party will bear its own costs in preparing for and participating in the mediation and one-half of the fees and expenses charged by JAMS for conducting the mediation.\nc.\nLitigation.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the definition of 'control' from 50% to 51%. This subtle change could lead to legal disputes because certain entities that qualify as 'Affiliates' under the original definition no longer qualify under the new definition, impacting obligations and rights.",

For the avoidance of doubt, after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Village Media\nCompany and its permitted licensees shall continue to have the right to fully exploit, use, and Exploit the HOFV Works for the\nlength of the term of the license granted by PFHOF in connection with such HOFV Work pursuant to Section 2.3; provided that\nthe length of the term of such license shall be a minimum of five (5) years.

                "explanation": "Changing 'non-exclusive' to 'exclusive' in the grant of rights introduces a potential conflict with Section 2.9. Section 2.9 allows PFHOF to exploit or license a third party to exploit an existing PFHOF Work if they cannot reach an agreement with Village Media. If Village Media now has an 'exclusive' license under Section 2.1, Section 2.9 becomes contradictory and unenforceable because PFHOF cannot grant rights they've already exclusively granted.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by stating all communications with the NFL must be through PFHOF, but then allows exceptions based on direction from the CEO of HOFV. This creates ambiguity regarding who has ultimate control over NFL-related communications and could lead to disputes over the validity of communications made by HOFV’s CEO without PFHOF’s involvement, particularly if PFHOF disputes those communications.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Principal appoints the Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor, to sell Principal’s qPCR infectious disease kits, Logix Smart COVID-19 PCR diagnostic test and Co-Dx Box™ instrument (the “Products”). The Products are described on Exhibit A to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This creates ambiguity because Exhibit A defines the Products, while this modification refers to Exhibit B. If Exhibit B does not exist or lists different products, it creates a contradiction about which products the distributor is authorized to sell.",

                "explanation": "The term 'non-exclusive' is changed to 'exclusive'. This creates a contradiction because the agreement now simultaneously states that the distributor has both exclusive and non-exclusive rights, directly conflicting the scope of the distributor's rights.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by first defining 'Authorized Work' to include commercial activities with consent, and then stating all commercial activities are strictly prohibited. This creates uncertainty regarding the permissibility of commercial activities under the agreement.",

The modified text establishes a single FTE rate for all personnel and prohibits any increases. This contradiction would cause disputes over invoicing and cost management.",

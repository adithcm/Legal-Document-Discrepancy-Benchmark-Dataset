                "changed_text": "For purposes of determining Affiliate’s Commission, an “Approved Account” means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate’s Website; (ii) is approved by Chase; and (iii) the applicant has made at least one purchase using the credit card within 90 days of approval.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Approved Account' only requires application approval and reporting. The modified version adds a condition that the applicant must also make a purchase within 90 days. This creates conflicting criteria for defining an 'Approved Account,' causing ambiguity and disputes over commission payments.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. The original text allows the affiliate to remove links without approval. The modified text adds a new requirement: all removed links need to be replaced with approved links within a specific timeframe. This creates ambiguity regarding the affiliate's freedom to manage links and introduces a condition of breach.",

Any affiliate exceeding this limit will be subject to a reduced commission rate on all accounts.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that affiliates applying for their own cards are not in violation of the agreement. The modified text adds a limit of one application per quarter, introducing a contradictory restriction. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over commission rates and the definition of 'acceptable use.'",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original definition of 'Gross Revenues' by including coupon sales, which were previously excluded. This creates ambiguity in calculating royalty payments, as the franchisee might argue that coupon sales should not be included.",

One Manager Trainee must be your Operating Principal (who meets the criteria in Section 6.15 of this Agreement), unless we mutually agree otherwise. You may designate another person who will be active in the day-to-day activities and management of the Franchised Business to be the second Manager Trainee. You may ask that additional employees be allowed to attend the portions of the initial training that are designed for your employees, and we will have the right to approve or disapprove that request. All trainees must be persons that we find acceptable at all times to serve in their respective capacities. As of the Effective Date, our training program has two components, as follows:\n(a) An Advanced Operations Course for your Operating Principal, which consists of up to twelve days for your\nOperating Principal and is conducted at our training facilities in Broward County, Florida, or at another location that we may specify in writing.\n(b) A Basic Operations Course for any Manager Trainee other than your Operating Principal, which consists of up to\ntwelve days of training and is conducted at our training facilities in Broward County, Florida, or at another location that we may specify in writing.\nYour Manager Trainees (other than your Operating Principal), and such of the Franchisee’s other employees as we designate must attend this\ncomponent of training.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'at the same time' has been changed to 'at different times'. This introduces a contradiction regarding the timing of the training program for Manager Trainees. It becomes unclear whether trainees are required to attend simultaneously, leading to potential disputes over compliance.",

Boxlot shall be responsible for providing all customer support regarding the Service or the Co-Branded Pages, and theglobe may redirect to Boxlot any associated customer support inquiries.  Boxlot shall have sole control over the user agreement that governs the Service, and Boxlot shall have the sole responsibility for dealing with breaches of such user agreement.",

Boxlot shall have shared control with theglobe over the user agreement that governs the Service, and Boxlot and theglobe shall have the shared responsibility for dealing with breaches of such user agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by defining different level of customer support responsibilities for each party rather than explicitly assigning customer support responsibilities solely to Boxlot. Further, the responsibility of the user agreement is now shared, conflicting with the original text.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that Boxlot can freely use user data but theglobe can not. The second sentence restricts both parties from disclosing data that permits the targeting of users. This means that Boxlot can technically use the user data but can't disclose the data which creates ambiguity.",

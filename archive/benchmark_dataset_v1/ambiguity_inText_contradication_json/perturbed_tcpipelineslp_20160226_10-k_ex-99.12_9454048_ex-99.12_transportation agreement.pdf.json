                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Section 8 initially states a fixed Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) as 101,300 Dth/Day, referencing Appendix A for detail. The added text allows the Transporter to unilaterally reduce this MDQ by up to 20%, thus creating uncertainty about what the actual agreed-upon MDQ is and undermining the initial definition. This impacts Shipper's ability to plan and rely on a consistent gas supply.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the relationship between the Transportation Service Agreement and the FERC Gas Tariff. While the section initially states that the Agreement incorporates and is subject to the FERC Gas Tariff (implying the Tariff takes precedence), the added text stipulates that specific terms of the Agreement will supersede conflicting provisions in the Tariff. This creates ambiguity about which document's terms control in the event of a conflict and could lead to disputes over interpretation and enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding the method of communication. Initially, Section 15 mandates that all notices and communications related to the Agreement must be in writing. However, the added text then allows for verbal communication for operational matters, provided they are documented by the Transporter. This introduces ambiguity: it is unclear what constitutes an 'operational matter', who decides this, and if the Shipper agrees with the Transporter documentation. This could lead to disputes regarding whether notice was properly given.",

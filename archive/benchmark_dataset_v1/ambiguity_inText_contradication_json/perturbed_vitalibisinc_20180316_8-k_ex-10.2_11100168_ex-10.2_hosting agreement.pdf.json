                "original_text": "VOTOCAST shall provide the Services to Licensee as specifically set forth in Exhibit A, attached hereto.",
                "changed_text": "VOTOCAST shall endeavor to provide the Services to Licensee as generally described in Exhibit A, attached hereto. The exact nature and scope of these Services will be determined based on VOTOCAST's internal resource allocation and are subject to change with a 30-day notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the provision of services exactly as described in Exhibit A. The modified text introduces flexibility for VOTOCAST to alter the services, creating a contradiction if Exhibit A specifies fixed service parameters. This creates uncertainty in what 'Services' the Licensee is entitled to.",

                "original_text": "All fees are due and payable within thirty (30) days of the applicable VOTOCAST invoice. Any payments made later than the due date will accrue interest from the date due until the date paid at the rate of one percent (I%) per month on the amount due, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. In addition, failure of Licensee to fully pay any fees within sixty (60) days after the applicable due date, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, justifying suspension of the performance of Services by VOTOCAST, and will be sufficient cause for immediate termination of this Agreement by VOTOCAST. Any such suspension does not relieve Licensee from paying fees past due plus interest and in the event of collection enforcement, Licensee shall be liable for any costs associated with such collection, including, but not limited to, legal costs, attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees.",
                "changed_text": "All fees should ideally be paid within thirty (30) days of the applicable VOTOCAST invoice. Late payments may accrue a nominal administrative fee. Failure of Licensee to substantially pay fees may lead to a review of the agreement terms. VOTOCAST may consider suspension of services, but will work with Licensee to find a mutually acceptable solution. Suspension does not relieve Licensee from the obligation to pay outstanding fees, and VOTOCAST retains the right to pursue reasonable collection efforts.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly outlines a strict payment timeline with defined penalties for late payments, including interest and potential termination. The modified text softens these terms, introducing ambiguity by using words like 'ideally,' 'nominal,' and 'substantially.' It also replaces the definite 'material breach' and 'immediate termination' with a more collaborative approach, creating an internal contradiction if other sections of the agreement rely on the strict payment terms.",

                "original_text": "Licensee agrees to defend any action brought against VOTOCAST with respect to any claim, demand, cause of action, debt or liability, including reasonable outside attorneys' fees, to the extent that such action arises from the negligence or willful misconduct of Licensee or is based upon a claim that any of the Licensee Content to be provided by Licensee hereunder or other material on the Mobile App infringes or violates any rights of third parties, including without limitation, rights or publicity, rights of privacy, patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and/or licenses.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee may offer assistance to VOTOCAST in defending any action brought against VOTOCAST related to the Licensee's actions. However, the specific level of support and financial contribution from the Licensee will be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the extent to which the Licensee's actions directly and provably caused the claim. VOTOCAST will bear the initial costs of defense, and Licensee's responsibility will only arise if negligence or willful misconduct is conclusively proven.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Licensee 'agrees to defend' which implies they will pay attorneys' fees as needed. The changed text makes their defense 'may offer assistance' and they only 'will arise if negligence or willful misconduct is conclusively proven'.",

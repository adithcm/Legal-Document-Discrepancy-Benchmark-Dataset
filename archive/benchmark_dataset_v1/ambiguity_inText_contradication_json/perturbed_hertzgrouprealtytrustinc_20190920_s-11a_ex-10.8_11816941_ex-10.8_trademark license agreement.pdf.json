                "original_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a person or entity, but ONLY through the ownership of voting securities. Contractual agreements or other means are explicitly excluded from constituting control.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts a later implicit understanding of 'Control' by narrowing its scope to ONLY ownership of voting securities. The original definition includes control exerted 'by contract or otherwise', which is removed here. This creates ambiguity about actions under the contract if the advisor is not the owner of any share in the Licensee.",

                "changed_text": "3.3 Upon termination of this Agreement, Licensed Users shall have a reasonable period, up to ninety (90) days, to cease use of the Licensed Trade Name and Licensed Mark, to allow for a smooth transition and rebranding efforts.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the termination clause to extend the allowable usage period of the licensed trade name and mark from 30 to 90 days. The original clause specifies immediate cessation 'as soon as practicable, but no longer than thirty days', while the revised version provides a more extended grace period. This may create issues if the licensor is dealing with another company that could create confusion in the mean time.",

LICENSOR DOES NOT MAKE WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE LICENSED MARK OR THIS AGREEMENT. However, Licensor warrants that it possesses the legal rights to license the Licensed Mark to Licensee.",
                "explanation": "This adds an explicit warranty regarding the Licensor's right to license the trademark, directly contradicting the initial statement that Licensor makes NO warranties of ANY kind. This could be confusing since at the begining, there are NO warranties, but latter on in the same paragraph there is one.",

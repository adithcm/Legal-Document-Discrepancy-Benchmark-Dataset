                "original_text": "Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor’s inventory to\nsupport sales. Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor’s inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is\nagreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon\nwritten notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",

Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor’s inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore will automatically replenish the stock to the agreed upon amount without any prior written notice to Distributor.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting obligations. The original text requires 'written notice' before Xplore replenishes stock, while the modified version states that Xplore will automatically replenish stock 'without any prior written notice.' This creates ambiguity as to whether notice is needed or not.",

Each purchase order for the Xplore Products shall be subject to Xplore’s acceptance and, upon acceptance, Xplore shall\nconfirm the purchase order and the Estimated Shipping Date with Distributor. Notwithstanding such acceptance, Xplore reserves the right\nwhere necessary to amend the Orders including without limitation part numbers, special pricing and Estimated Shipping Date, and may at its\nsole discretion require an amended Order from Distributor incorporating such changes.

                "explanation": "The original states 'any additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice shall have no effect', but the modified version adds 'unless otherwise explicitly agreed to in writing by both parties'. This contradicts the original strict exclusion of additional terms, introducing uncertainty as to when such terms might be valid. Also the defition of 'Estimated Shipping Date' is changed from 'estimated' to 'confirmed', creating a contradiction.",

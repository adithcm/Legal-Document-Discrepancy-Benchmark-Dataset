                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause, which prohibited Programmer from selling advertising time. Now, the Programmer has the exclusive right to sell ads, creating a direct conflict and uncertainty about which party controls advertising revenue.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that failure to perform obligations or breach of warranties 'will be deemed' an event of default. The modified text changes this to 'may be deemed', introducing ambiguity and giving the Licensee discretion. Furthermore, it adds conditions (Licensee's discretion, direct financial loss) that were not present before, conflicting with the absolute nature of the original clause. This creates uncertainty regarding what constitutes a default.",

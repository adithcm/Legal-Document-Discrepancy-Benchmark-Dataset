Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as part of the consideration of the full and timely payment of the Sponsor Fees, Club hereby grants to Sponsor, and Sponsor hereby accepts, solely in the Territory, and during the Term: (i) the right to use the Benefits set forth on Exhibit A and the license and right to use the Team Marks solely in connection with the advertisement and promotion of Sponsor’s Dick’s Wings and Grill branded restaurants (the “Sponsor Business”) in accordance with this Agreement; and (ii) the right to use the designation “Official Wings of the Jacksonville Jaguars” and such other designations as Club and Sponsor may agree to in a writing from time to time (collectively, the “Official Designations”), solely in connection with the Sponsor Business. No license or right is granted for the use of any other Club intellectual property for any other purpose, in any geographic area outside the Territory, for any medium of distribution that cannot be reasonably limited to the Territory, or during any period before or after the Term. The rights granted to Sponsor pursuant to this Section 2 may not be used to promote or advertise any products or services of Sponsor other than the Sponsor Business, or any other person or entity, whether directly or by affiliation, cooperation, co-sponsorship, or any joint programs or promotions.",

                "explanation": "The original text restricts the use of 'Official Designations' solely to the 'Sponsor Business' (Dick's Wings and Grill). The modified text expands this to 'any business venture of Sponsor.' This creates a contradiction because later in the same section, it is stated that the rights may only be used to promote the Sponsor Business. This conflicting definition introduces ambiguity over which business activities the sponsorship benefits apply to, potentially leading to disputes if the Sponsor promotes ventures beyond Dick's Wings.",

Sponsor shall deliver the food (the cost of which is included in the Annual Trade Value) to the Stadium at the time and location specified by Club. If any portion of the Annual Trade Value is not used in any given Contract Year, such unused amount shall carry forward to the subsequent Contract Year.

The Club is responsible for picking up the food (the cost of which is included in the Annual Trade Value) from the Sponsor's main distribution center located in Jacksonville, Florida. If any portion of the Annual Trade Value is not used in any given Contract Year, such unused amount shall not carry forward to the subsequent Contract Year. If any portion of the Annual Trade Value is not used at the end of the Term, Sponsor shall reimburse the club with the unused value.

                "explanation": "This section originally states that the Sponsor delivers the food. It now states that the Club picks up the food. Also, the unused amount now no longer carries forward to the subsequent contract year. And also, instead of being able to use the remaining amount after 12 months, the sponsor is going to reimburse the unused value. This change introduces confusion regarding responsibilities for delivering food and creates new rules for what happens if the value isn't all used.",

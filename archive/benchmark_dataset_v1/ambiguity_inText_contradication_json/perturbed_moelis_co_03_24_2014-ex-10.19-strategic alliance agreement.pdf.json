Confidential Information shall not include any information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the receiving Party (or any of its Affiliates) or its or their Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (b) was within the receiving Party’s possession prior to its being furnished to the receiving Party by or on behalf of the disclosing Party (or any of its Affiliates), provided that the source of such information was not known by the receiving Party (or any of its Affiliates) to be subject to a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party (or any of its Affiliates); (c) becomes available to the receiving Party from a source other than the disclosing Party (or any of its Affiliates) or its or their Representatives, provided that such source is not known by the receiving Party (or any of its Affiliates) to be subject to a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party (or any of its Affiliates); or (d) is independently developed by the receiving Party (or any of its Affiliates) without use of the disclosing Party’s (or any of its Affiliates’) Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "8.1 Confidential Information shall mean only information of a Party (or of any of its Affiliates) that is disclosed to the other Party (or any of its Affiliates) in writing, and is explicitly marked as \"Confidential\" at the time of disclosure. This definition supersedes all other interpretations or prior communications, oral or written, regarding what constitutes Confidential Information under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition is broad, encompassing oral and visual disclosures later summarized in writing. The modified definition limits Confidential Information to explicitly marked written disclosures only, contradicting the broader scope initially implied.  This creates uncertainty about which information qualifies as 'Confidential Information' under the agreement, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Delaware law, while the modified clause specifies New York law with special attention to conflicts of law principles related to intellectual property. This creates a direct conflict regarding the governing law, leading to potential disputes over which state's laws apply to the agreement, impacting the interpretation and enforcement of the contract, especially in matters relating to intellectual property rights.",

                "changed_text": "13.3 This Agreement must be executed as a single, unified document. Counterparts are not permitted, and any signature made on a separate page will render the entire agreement void.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly allows for counterpart execution, which is a standard practice. The modified clause prohibits counterparts and threatens invalidation of the entire agreement if counterparts are used. This direct contradiction creates considerable uncertainty and potential legal challenges surrounding the validity of the agreement if signed in multiple counterparts. The parties could argue whether the original or the modified clause holds precedence.",

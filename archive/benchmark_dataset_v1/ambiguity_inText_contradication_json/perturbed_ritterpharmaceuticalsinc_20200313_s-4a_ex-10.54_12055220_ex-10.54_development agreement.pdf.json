                "original_text": "1.2. Affiliate shall mean, (i) with respect to Qualigen, any corporation or other form of business organization, which directly or indirectly owns, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Qualigen, and (ii), with respect to Sekisui, shall mean Sekisui Diagnostics (UK) Ltd., Sekisui Diagnostics PEI, Inc., SEKISUI MEDICAL CO., LTD., and Sekisui Diagnostics GmbH. An entity shall be regarded as being in control of another entity if the former entity has the direct or indirect power to vote more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities (or other ownership interest for a business organization other than a corporation) of that entity, or the direct or indirect ability to direct or cause the direction of the general management and policies of the other entity.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. Affiliate shall mean, (i) with respect to Qualigen, any corporation or other form of business organization, which directly or indirectly owns, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Qualigen. An entity shall be regarded as being in control of another entity if the former entity has the direct or indirect power to vote more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities (or other ownership interest for a business organization other than a corporation) of that entity, or the direct or indirect ability to direct or cause the direction of the general management and policies of the other entity.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' explicitly lists Sekisui's Affiliates, providing certainty. The modified definition removes this list, making it unclear which specific entities are considered Sekisui's Affiliates under the agreement. This ambiguity could create disputes over whether a particular entity's actions are attributable to Sekisui under the contract, affecting liability and obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Products' encompasses both current and future products of Qualigen. The modified definition explicitly excludes future products and improvements. This creates a contradiction, as other sections of the agreement may refer to 'Products' in a way that implies inclusion of future developments, leading to uncertainty about the scope of the agreement's coverage.",

Title to Products ordered by Sekisui shall pass to Sekisui upon delivery to the designated Sekisui storeroom at Qualigen’s facility. While held at the Sekisui storeroom, any physical inventory loss will be the responsibility of Qualigen. Sekisui undertakes that all Sekisui inventory of Products shall be kept at such designated Sekisui storeroom at Qualigen’s facility, until resale to Sekisui’s customers.",
                "changed_text": "4.3. Delivery Terms. Qualigen shall deliver Products ordered by Sekisui, FCA (Incoterms 2010) Qualigen’s facility in Carlsbad, California. Title to Products ordered by Sekisui shall pass to Sekisui upon notification of readiness for shipment, regardless of physical delivery to the designated Sekisui storeroom at Qualigen’s facility. While held at the Sekisui storeroom, any physical inventory loss will be the responsibility of Sekisui. Sekisui undertakes that all Sekisui inventory of Products shall be kept at such designated Sekisui storeroom at Qualigen’s facility, until resale to Sekisui’s customers.",
                "explanation": "The original terms define title transfer upon physical delivery to Sekisui's storeroom, with Qualigen bearing inventory loss risk until that point. The modified version shifts title transfer to 'notification of readiness,' making Sekisui responsible for inventory loss even before physical possession. This creates uncertainty regarding liability for damage or loss occurring between readiness notification and actual delivery, potentially leading to disputes.",

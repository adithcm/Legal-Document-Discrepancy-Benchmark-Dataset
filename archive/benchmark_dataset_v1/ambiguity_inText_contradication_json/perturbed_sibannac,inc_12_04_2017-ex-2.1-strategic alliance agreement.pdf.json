                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek and registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, at the fixed rate of 10% of project revenue, payable NET 60 days after project completion, regardless of client payment.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause by fixing the lead-finder fee at 10% and making it payable 60 days after project completion, irrespective of client payments. The original clause allowed for a fee range of 10-20% decided by COMPANY and tied payment to client payments. This creates ambiguity regarding the compensation terms.",

Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",

Such notice must be given sixty (60) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the notice period required for non-renewal and termination. Initially, both required 90 days notice. The modified version requires 60 days notice for non-renewal and 30 days for termination, creating confusion over the actual requirements for ending the agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change narrows the definition of 'Confidential Information'. The original definition was broad, covering technical and non-technical information related to client projects and business of each party. The modified definition limits it to technical information directly related to the patented Air Cylinder Wheel technology. This introduces ambiguity, as it becomes unclear if non-technical business information is also protected, creating conflicting interpretations.",

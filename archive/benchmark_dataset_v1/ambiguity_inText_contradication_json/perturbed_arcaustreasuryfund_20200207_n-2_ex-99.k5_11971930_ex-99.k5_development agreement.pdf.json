Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 5 to the contrary, nothing contained herein shall protect or be deemed to protect the Indemnified Parties against or entitle or be deemed to entitle the Indemnified Parties to indemnification in respect of, any liability to the Fund or its security holders to which the Indemnified Parties would otherwise be subject by reason of criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of the Blockchain Administrator's duties and obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) shall only be liable to the Fund for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Blockchain Administrator in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as blockchain administrator of the Fund.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the Blockchain Administrator's liability and the Fund's indemnification obligations. The original text states the Blockchain Administrator is not liable (except for certain misconduct) and is indemnified by the Fund. The modified version states the Blockchain Administrator *is* liable and is *not* indemnified, directly conflicting with the original intent. This contradiction will result in uncertainty in enforcement.",

This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon 60 days' written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by the vote of the Fund's Trustees or by the Blockchain Administrator. The provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and the Blockchain Administrator shall remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. Further, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this Agreement as aforesaid, the Blockchain Administrator shall be entitled to any amounts owed under Section 4 through the date of termination or expiration, and Section 5 shall continue in force and effect and apply to the Blockchain Administrator and its representatives as and to the extent applicable.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall become effective as of the first date above written. This Agreement may be terminated at any time, with the payment of a penalty of one million dollars, upon 60 days' written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, but not by the vote of the Fund's Trustees or by the Blockchain Administrator. The provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement shall not remain in full force and effect, and the Blockchain Administrator shall not remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. Further, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this Agreement as aforesaid, the Blockchain Administrator shall not be entitled to any amounts owed under Section 4 through the date of termination or expiration, and Section 5 shall not continue in force and effect and apply to the Blockchain Administrator and its representatives as and to the extent applicable.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces contradictions by altering the conditions for termination and the effect of termination. Initially, the agreement can be terminated without penalty by multiple parties, and Section 5 (liability/indemnification) remains in effect. The modified version imposes a penalty for termination, restricts who can terminate, and states that Section 5 does *not* remain in effect, creating a disagreement about termination terms.",

The Blockchain Administrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be preserved for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided above.

The modified version contradicts all these points, stating records will *not* be kept per the ICA, are *not* the property of the fund, are *not* accessible, will *not* be preserved and can be destroyed, and will *not* be surrendered. This creates a conflict of record-keeping responsibilities.",

Subject to Section 1.2, Franchisor hereby grants to Franchisee the exclusive right, (a) to\nestablish and operate Smaaash Centres in the Territory, (b) to sub-license the right to establish and operate Smaaash Centres to third party\nfranchisees in and for the Territory, (c) a license to use the products and other services developed by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash\nCentres (including a right to authorise the use of products and services developed by the Franchisor by third party franchisees), in the Territory,\nand (d) to identify third party franchisees for the Smaaash Centres in the Territory. The rights granted herein include the limited license to use the\nTrademarks of the Franchisor (the details of which are morefully set out in Exhibit A), as set out in Section 3 of this Agreement, for the purposes of\nestablishing and operating the Smaaash Centres in the Territory. It is clarified that if third party franchisees shall be establishing and operating\nSmaaash Centres in the manner contemplated under this Agreement, then the Franchisee shall ensure that such third party franchisees complies\nwith all the obligations and duties of the Franchisee, as recorded under this Agreement, and to this extent, Franchisee may enter into relevant\nagreements with such third party franchisees.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'exclusive right' to 'non-exclusive right' directly contradicts later references to the franchise being exclusive. Additionally, changing 'shall ensure' to 'may not be required to ensure' causes confusion on duties to third party.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be under an obligation' to 'are encouraged' makes the minimum number of centers non-binding. Changing 'shall be established and operated in the Territory using the assumed trade name 'Smaaash'or any other trade name that the Franchisor may designate' to 'may be established and operated in the Territory using the assumed trade name 'Smaaash'or any other trade name that the Franchisee may prefer' makes the Smaaash brand name choice of the Franchisee. Finally, adding the 'using subcontractors' to 'shall perform its obligations' causes a direct contradiction with using the Third Parties with obligations, and the last phrase has also been changed to reflect approval to be unreasonably withheld.",

                "explanation": "Firstly, it says there will be mutual agreement to terminate, but then it lists certain conditions of termination. Secondly, it is stated that the Franchisor will not terminate if the Franchisee fails to make payments. Finally, Franchisee is allowed to cease operations, directly contradicting earlier sections about operating requirements. Also, the curing failures are at the discretion of the franchisee. The multiple direct contradictions create significant uncertainty.",

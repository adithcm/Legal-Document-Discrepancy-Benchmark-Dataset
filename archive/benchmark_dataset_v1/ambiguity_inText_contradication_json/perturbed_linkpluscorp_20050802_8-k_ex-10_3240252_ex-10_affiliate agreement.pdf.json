RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES\n         4.1      The parties will be joint venturers only as to those\n                  activities that they jointly undertake for the AMR market as\n                  described in section 3 aboveÍ¾ otherwise they shall be\n                  independent of each other, with full control over their\n                  respective activities without the need to account to the\n                  other, and independent contractors as to all work performed\n                  under separate agreements.

                "changed_text": "4.       RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES\n         4.1      The parties will be joint venturers as to those activities that they jointly undertake for the AMR market as described in section 3 above.  Furthermore, for all activities related to the water meter product described in 3.1.1, the parties will be considered a general partnership with equal sharing of profits and losses. For all other activities, they shall be independent of each other, with full control over their respective activities without the need to account to the other, and independent contractors as to all work performed under separate agreements. Even though the parties will be joint venturers as to the AMR market, neither party will have the right to bind the other in any way without the other party's express consent, except for actions directly related to the water meter development, where either party can bind the other to commitments up to $10,000. This Agreement shall not otherwise be construed to make any party the agent, assignee, employee, fiduciary, investor, joint venturer, partner, or representative of any other party, except as explicitly stated regarding the water meter partnership.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by defining the relationship as a joint venture for the AMR market generally, but then specifying a general partnership for the water meter product, with a limited ability for each party to bind the other. This contradicts the earlier statement that neither party can bind the other without express consent, creating ambiguity about the scope of the partnership and each party's authority.",

TERM\n         This Agreement will remain in force for a period of five (5) years, automatically renewing for subsequent five (5) year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least six (6) months prior to the end of the current term.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this agreement shall automatically terminate upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party, regardless of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement is in force for perpetuity, or until amended by both parties. The modified text provides a fixed term of five years with automatic renewal, but *also* adds a condition for automatic termination upon bankruptcy. This creates an **internal contradiction**: Is the agreement meant to last forever unless amended, or is it subject to a fixed term *and* termination upon bankruptcy? The perpetuity clause conflicts with the fixed-term structure and the bankruptcy termination clause.",

While non-payment is a serious matter, it is not automatically considered a material breach. Before pursuing legal action, the parties must first engage in a good-faith mediation process, lasting no more than 30 days, to resolve the payment dispute. If, after the mediation, a resolution is not reached and the payment remains outstanding, the party due payment may pursue legal action to recover the payment; however, the amount recoverable shall be capped at the original due amount and shall not include any legal fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines non-payment after 60 days as a material breach, allowing immediate legal action. The modified text removes the automatic material breach classification, introduces a mediation requirement, limits recoverable damages, and introduces discretion to the paying party, directly contradicting the severity and consequences of non-payment defined in the original text. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of payment obligations.",

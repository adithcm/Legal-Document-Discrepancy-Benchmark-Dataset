                "original_text": "For purposes of this Section 1.1(b), (i) the “Market Price” of any Products & Services shall mean the price for such Products & Services established by Constellation as the competitive market price at which such Products & Services are to be made available to Constellation’s customers with a similar anticipated load profile within a specified utility service territory.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Section 1.1(b), (i) the “Market Price” of any Products & Services shall mean the price for such Products & Services established by Constellation as the competitive market price at which such Products & Services are to be made available to Constellation’s *preferred* customers with a *guaranteed* load profile within a specified utility service territory.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Market Price' refers to prices for customers with a similar 'anticipated' load profile. The modified definition restricts it to 'preferred' customers with a 'guaranteed' load profile. This creates a contradiction because it is unclear whether the HOF Entities qualify as 'preferred customers' or if they have a 'guaranteed' load profile. This introduces uncertainty in price determination and could lead to disputes.",

Constellation will provide all Products and Services to the best of their knowledge and understanding.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Constellation warrants all Products & Services will comply with all applicable laws. The modified text replaces 'will be' with 'will generally be' and includes a statement on 'best of their knowledge', creating ambiguity and a contradiction. The level of compliance becomes vague, creating uncertainty about legal obligations. This change also creates uncertainty about the liability of Constellation.",

The HOF Entities *can also* remove any content, Marks, data or other materials from the HOF Entities’ property with justification that the content is just not in alignment with their mission.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the HOF entities 'determine will' infringe. The modified definition includes 'reasonably determine', and adds an additional clause that the HOF Entities 'can also remove any content...with justification that the content is just not in alignment with their mission'. These changes introduce subjectivity and create a contradiction. It is now unclear if 'reasonably determine' includes alignment with the mission, or if a 'justification that the content is not in alignment with their mission' needs to be considered as 'reasonably determine', or is an additional reason to remove, giving the HOF Entities more power in determining what content is 'in alignment', and causes enforcement to become more difficult and open to subjective arguments.",

For purposes of this Agreement, the term “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to\ndirect or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or\notherwise.",

For purposes of this Agreement, the term “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) means the ability to influence the management and policies of a Person. Exercising control requires ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting securities.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'control' is broad and includes influence through various means. The modified version provides a narrower definition tied solely to ownership of 50% or more of voting securities. The removal of the $25,000,000 limit of net sales provides a contradiction and makes enforcement uncertain, since under one definition, acquiring control of business exceeding that amount would be prohibited, while under another, it would be allowed.",

                "explanation": "The final clause originally prohibits hiring employees who were generally solicited during the Non-Solicit Period. The modified version now allows the hiring of these same employees, creating a direct contradiction regarding the scope of the non-solicitation agreement. This ambiguity raises questions about which version of the agreement takes precedence, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Originally, injunctive relief was available for any breach of the agreement. The modification first limits injunctive relief to *material* breaches. However, there is another condition added that explicitly limits recourse to monetary damages for any breach. This conflict makes it unclear whether injunctive relief is an option for even material breaches, or if monetary damages are the sole remedy available. This introduces significant uncertainty in enforcement, as the Buyer's ability to obtain specific performance is now ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "A. “Contract Period” shall mean that period of time of three (3) years commencing on November 1st, 2017 and concluding November 2nd, 2020, unless terminated sooner or extended as provided in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "A. “Contract Period” shall mean that period of time of three (3) years commencing on November 1st, 2017 and concluding November 2nd, 2020. The contract period is subject to early termination based on product sales as determined by NFLA.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the contract period with a start and end date, and indicates that it can only be terminated or extended as explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement. The modified text introduces ambiguity by adding a condition for early termination based on product sales as determined by NFLA. This contradicts the original clarity, as the criteria for 'product sales' and the mechanism by which NFLA determines termination are not defined, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

A Licensed Product in no circumstance shall be valued at less than one (1) full Unit and under no circumstance shall a Unit be fractionalized (if required rounded up to the nearest whole number).",
                "changed_text": "K. “One (1) Unit” shall represent $0.05 (1 Unit = $0.05USD) for purposes of defining the monetary donation allocation of the Company’s sold products to the NFLA-NC, specific to the terms of this Agreement. A Licensed Product may, at the NFLA-NC's discretion, be valued at less than one (1) full Unit depending on promotional periods. Units can be fractionalized with Company approval.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction in how 'One (1) Unit' is valued. The original text states definitively that a licensed product will *never* be valued at less than one unit and units cannot be fractionalized. The altered text introduces the possibility of valuing a product at less than one unit and allows for fractionalization, dependent on NFLA-NC's discretion and Company Approval which contradicts the original definition and leads to ambiguity in calculating donation amounts.",

If Company desires to use the services of the NFLA-NC and/or any of its officers and members as a model in connection with Company advertising to promote its Products or as a part of a special promotional appearance for the Company, the NFLA-NC agrees, at the request of Company, to provide a good faith effort services of the officers or members of the NFLA for a reasonable amount of time as mutually agreed upon by all parties and at places reasonably convenient to each parties schedule. Each day shall not exceed a reasonable number of hours unless otherwise mutually agreed upon. The Company agrees that it will reimburse the NFLA-NC and if applicable the NFLA or its officers/members for all reasonable travel, lodging and meal expenses incurred by the NFLA / NFLA-NC or its officers/members in connection with such services. The Company understands that failure to use services of a member of the NFLA / NFLA-NC pursuant to this section shall not result in any reduction in payments to NFLA-NC under this Agreement. The obligations of the NFLA / NFLA-NC to provide services of its officers/members under this Agreement are subject to the condition that payments to NFLA-NC are current and up to date.",
                "changed_text": "A. If Company desires to use the services of the NFLA-NC and/or any of its officers and members as a model in connection with Company advertising to promote its Products or as a part of a special promotional appearance for the Company, the NFLA-NC will use its best endeavors to provide services of the officers or members of the NFLA for a reasonable amount of time. The Company agrees that it will reimburse the NFLA-NC and if applicable the NFLA or its officers/members for all reasonable travel, lodging and meal expenses incurred by the NFLA / NFLA-NC or its officers/members in connection with such services. The Company understands that failure to use services of a member of the NFLA / NFLA-NC pursuant to this section may result in a pro rata reduction in payments to NFLA-NC under this Agreement. The obligations of the NFLA / NFLA-NC to provide services of its officers/members under this Agreement are unconditional.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the NFLA-NC agrees to 'provide a good faith effort', and explicitly states that failure to use NFLA-NC member services 'shall not result in any reduction in payments'. The modified text changes 'good faith effort' to 'best endeavors', implies potential reduction in payment due to failure to utilize member services, and removes the conditional clause of payments being up to date. These contradictions lead to potential dispute over the scope of NFLA-NC's service obligations and the company's payment obligations under various potential conditions that are now undefined. Additionally, shifting the agreement obligations from Conditional to Unconditional puts the organization in possible legal dispute.",

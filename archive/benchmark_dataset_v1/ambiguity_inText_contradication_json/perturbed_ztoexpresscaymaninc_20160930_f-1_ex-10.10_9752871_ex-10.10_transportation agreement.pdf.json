                "changed_text": "2. Period of transportation services: this Agreement is valid for an indefinite term. This agreement shall automatically terminate 1 year from the execution date.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the term of the agreement. It is initially stated as 'indefinite' but then is described as a fixed one year. This creates uncertainty regarding the agreement's duration and renewal.",
                "location": "Section 2"

In order to guarantee rapid transfer of Party A’s parcel, Party B shall strictly comply with the following obligations:\n\n(a) During the transportation, Part B shall completely comply with Party A’s transportation arrangement and relevant systems. Party B shall bear any consequences and legal liability arising out of Party B’s non-compliance, and Party A shall have no liability. Party A has the right to terminate this Agreement without further legal liability in the case that Party B does not comply with Party A’s management and arrangement.",
                "changed_text": "5. In order to guarantee rapid transfer of Party A’s parcel, Party B shall strictly comply with the following obligations:\n\n(a) During the transportation, Part B shall reasonably comply with Party A’s transportation arrangement and relevant systems. Party B shall bear any consequences and legal liability arising out of Party B’s gross negligence of non-compliance, and Party A shall have no liability. Party A does not have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'completely comply' to 'reasonably comply' and 'non-compliance' to 'gross negligence of non-compliance' significantly alters the standard of performance required from Party B. Further, denying Party A's right to terminate the contract goes against original intention and introduces an internal contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "15. Any different interpretation of this Agreement by both Parties shall be resolved through mutual negotiation and, failing that, by binding arbitration. The final interpretation shall be made by the appointed arbitrator.",
                "explanation": "This clause initially gives Party A the unilateral right of final interpretation. The modification now mandates a negotiation and arbitration process, contradicting the earlier statement. This introduces ambiguity regarding the dispute resolution mechanism and potentially weakens Party A's control over the interpretation of the agreement.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "“Service” means the television programming service provided by Network as defined in the preamble to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "“Service” means the television programming service provided by Network, which may be altered, edited, or changed at the Affiliate's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Service' clearly designates it as the programming provided by the Network. The modified definition introduces a contradiction by allowing the Affiliate to alter the service, making it unclear whether the 'Service' refers to the Network's original programming or the Affiliate's modified version. This would create uncertainty about which programming is covered under the agreement.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(a) Affiliate shall actively promote the Service consistent with its business judgment, including the broadcast by each Station transmitting the Service of an average of at least ten (10) thirty (30)-second promotional announcements per week for the Service (“Promotional Spots”) on the Station’s Primary Feed, including the Station’s analog signal for so long as the Station broadcasts an analog signal, on a run-of-station basis, commencing no later than the first air date of the Service on the applicable Station.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Affiliate shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the Service, including broadcasting promotional announcements. The Affiliate's promotional efforts are subject to change based on market conditions and available resources.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a specific promotional activity (10 thirty-second spots per week). The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing the specific requirement with a vague obligation to use 'commercially reasonable efforts.' This creates a contradiction because the original contract requires a concrete action, while the modified version allows for subjective interpretation of promotional efforts, undermining the enforceability of a minimum promotional commitment. This can be considered a weakening of the original promotion terms.",
                "location": "Section 8"

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Affiliate agrees not to sell commercial time to or for the benefit of direct competitors of the Service (e.g., music video networks carried by MVPDs such as MTV, VH1 and Fuse). All Local Advertising shall comply with the pertinent Station’s generally applicable broadcast standards and Affiliate shall be solely responsible for all Local Advertising and all liabilities associated therewith, including insertion, trafficking, billing and collection activities relating to the Local Advertising and for the content of the material inserted into the Local Advertising.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate should avoid selling commercial time to direct competitors of the Service when feasible. All Local Advertising shall comply with the laws and regulations, Network’s broadcast standards, and Affiliate will share responsibilities for Local Advertising and liabilities with Network.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear restriction and outlines the responsibilities of the Affiliate in Local Advertising. By changing the first sentence to 'Affiliate should avoid,' the restriction is weakened. Also, the shift from 'solely responsible' to 'share responsibilities with Network' creates an inconsistency because the contract does not specify the degree to which the responsibility is shared. This creates a conflicting definition and uncertainty in who is ultimately responsible.",

                "changed_text": "Contribution by Sponsor:\nIn consideration for the right to sponsor the Kaya Fest and to be acknowledged by Fruit of Life Productions LLC., as a Promoter of the event\nduring the term of this Agreement, Sponsor agrees to contract with Fruit of Life Productions LLC., for the amount of $250,000.00 to be paid with an initial payment of $50,000 upon signing of this agreement, and the remaining $200,000 based on milestones to be agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the payment terms. Initially, the full amount was due upon signing. Now, the payment is split with unspecified milestones, conflicting with the original immediate payment requirement. This creates an internal contradiction concerning when and how the Sponsor fulfills their financial obligation.",

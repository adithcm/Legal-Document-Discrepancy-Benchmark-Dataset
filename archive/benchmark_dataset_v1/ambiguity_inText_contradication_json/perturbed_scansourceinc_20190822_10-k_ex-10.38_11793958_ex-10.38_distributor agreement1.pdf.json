For the purposes of this Agreement, an Affiliate shall be defined as any entity listed on Exhibit E, regardless of ownership percentage.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Affiliate'. The original text states that Affiliates are wholly-owned subsidiaries, while the modified version includes entities with partial ownership, creating ambiguity about which entities qualify as Affiliates under the agreement and creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the cost of advance replacement parts and the condition of replacement products. The original text states that advance replacements are subject to Cisco's 'then-current Advance Replacement charge', but the modified text says there is no charge. The original also allows for 'new or equivalent to new' products, whereas the modified version dictates that they 'will always be new'. These conflicting terms creates uncertainty around financial obligations and the expected quality of replacements.",

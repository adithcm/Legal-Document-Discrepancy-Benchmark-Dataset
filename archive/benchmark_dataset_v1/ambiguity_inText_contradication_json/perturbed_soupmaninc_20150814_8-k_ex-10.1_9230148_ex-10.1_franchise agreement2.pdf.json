                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A.  Guarantors shall use their best efforts to pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall pay' to 'shall use their best efforts to pay,' the obligation becomes less definitive. This introduces uncertainty about whether the Guarantors are absolutely required to pay, or only required to make a reasonable attempt.",
                "location": "Paragraph A"

            {

                "original_text": "B. Guarantors shall unconditionally guarantee full performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of all the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement at the times and in the manner therein provided.",
                "changed_text": "B. Guarantors shall endeavor to guarantee the performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of all the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement at the times and in the manner therein provided, provided that Guarantors are notified of any shortfall within thirty days.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states an unconditional guarantee, while the modified version introduces a 'endeavor' standard coupled with a notification requirement. This contradicts the unconditional nature of the guarantee, as now the Guarantor's responsibility is dependent on the Franchisor providing notification, creating ambiguity. The term Guarantors’ obligation shifts from 'unconditionally guarantee' to 'endeavor to guarantee'.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "D. Franchisor shall not be obligated to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust any security from Master Franchisee or pursue or exhaust any remedy, including any legal or equitable relief against Master Franchisee, before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations may take place before, after, or contemporaneously with, enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "D. Franchisor shall make reasonable attempts to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust available security from Master Franchisee before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee. The extent and nature of these attempts will be determined at the Franchisor's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states the Franchisor is *not* obligated to pursue the Master Franchisee before enforcing the guarantee. The modified clause, however, introduces an obligation to make 'reasonable attempts' to pursue the Master Franchisee first. This creates a conflict as to whether the Franchisor can immediately pursue the Guarantors or must first attempt to recover from the Master Franchisee. The term Franchisor’s obligation changes from 'shall not be obligated' to 'shall make reasonable attempts'",

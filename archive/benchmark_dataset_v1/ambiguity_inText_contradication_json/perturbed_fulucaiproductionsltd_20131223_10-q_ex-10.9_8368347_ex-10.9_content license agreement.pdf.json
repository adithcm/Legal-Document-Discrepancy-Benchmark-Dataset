                "changed_text": "License Term\nPerpetual, unlimited runs\nx Other: 2 years\nCommencing: November 15, 2012\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, for digital distribution channels, the License Term shall be limited to one year from the Commencement Date.",
                "explanation": "The Deal Terms initially specify 'Perpetual, unlimited runs' but provide an option for '2 years.' The added text introduces further conflict by stating a one-year limit for digital channels. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual duration of the license for digital distribution, potentially leading to disputes over rights and revenue sharing.",

During the License Term (which is identified in the Deal\nTerms), Producer agrees that ConvergTV has the exclusive right to exercise the rights granted to it under this Agreement with respect to the\nProgram, including those in Section 1, within the Licensed Territory.",

During the License Term (which is identified in the Deal\nTerms), Producer agrees that ConvergTV has the exclusive right to exercise the rights granted to it under this Agreement with respect to the\nProgram, including those in Section 1, within the Licensed Territory.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Producer reserves the right to license short clips (under 5 minutes) of the Program to other platforms for promotional purposes.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction to the exclusivity clause. While the original clause grants ConvergTV exclusive rights, the addition allows the Producer to license short clips elsewhere. This creates uncertainty about the scope of ConvergTV's exclusivity, potentially leading to conflicts over distribution rights and revenue generation. It makes it unclear if the ‘promotional purposes’ includes monetization by Producer in any way.",

ConvergTV's obligation to provide security is limited to commercially reasonable efforts, and ConvergTV shall not be liable for any security breaches unless directly caused by its gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "While the original text states that ConvergTV shall provide 'reasonable protections,' the added text limits this obligation to 'commercially reasonable efforts' and introduces a high threshold of 'gross negligence' for liability. This weakens the security obligation, creating a contradiction between the initial commitment to provide reasonable protections and the limited liability under the added clause. This could lead to disputes over the adequacy of security measures and responsibility for losses due to breaches.",

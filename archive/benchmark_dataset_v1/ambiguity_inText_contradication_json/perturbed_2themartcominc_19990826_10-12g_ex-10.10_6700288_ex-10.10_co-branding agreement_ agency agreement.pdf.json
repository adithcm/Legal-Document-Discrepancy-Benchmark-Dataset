                "explanation": "The original text specifies a record-keeping period of one year with audits occurring every twelve months, whereas the modified text specifies a record-keeping period of six months with audits occurring every eighteen months. This discrepancy creates ambiguity regarding the duration for which i-Escrow must retain financial records and the frequency of audits, impacting the ability to verify the accuracy of advertising payments. Additionally, the inspection cost allocation is reversed depending on overdue payments and the percentage amount is also changed.",

                "changed_text": "“Business” means an online platform; the specific focus or industry of the platform is not relevant to this agreement. This includes any online presence the Licensee may operate.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies the 'Business' as an online real estate media platform, limiting its scope. The modified definition broadens it to any online platform, irrespective of its industry, creating a contradiction. This introduces ambiguity regarding what constitutes 'the Business' for the purposes of the agreement's obligations and rights.",

Licensee shall monitor and censor all Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including without limitation Content posted by end users. Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee’s failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "changed_text": "3.3. Website Monitoring and Censoring.\n\n(a) Licensee Obligations. Licensee may monitor and censor Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including without limitation Content posted by end users. The extent of such monitoring and censoring shall be at the sole discretion of the Licensee. Licensee is encouraged to remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites after it becomes aware of such offending Content; however, failure to do so will not be considered a breach of this agreement. The Licensor has no right to remove such content.",
                "explanation": "The original section mandates that the Licensee 'shall' monitor and censor content and remove offending content within a specific timeframe, and failure to do so is a material breach. The modified version changes 'shall' to 'may' and removes the penalty for failing to censor. The original section also grants the Licensor the right to remove offending content, whereas the changed version denies them that right. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the Licensee's and Licensor's obligations and rights regarding content moderation.",

This Agreement and any rights or authority granted hereunder shall not be assigned or transferred by either Party, including by operation of law, merger or otherwise, without the express written consent of the other Party, provided that Licensor may assign this Agreement without consent to any of its Affiliates and Licensee may assign this Agreement without consent to SINA Leju or an Affiliate of Licensee that is controlled by SINA Leju.",

This Agreement and any rights or authority granted hereunder can be assigned or transferred by either Party, including by operation of law, merger or otherwise, without the need of any consent of the other Party. The assigning party will have to inform the other party in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement cannot be assigned or transferred without express written consent, but then provides exceptions where no consent is needed. The modified version removes the need for consent entirely. This creates a contradiction, making it unclear under what circumstances the agreement can be assigned or transferred, which affects the stability and enforceability of the contract if ownership changes.",

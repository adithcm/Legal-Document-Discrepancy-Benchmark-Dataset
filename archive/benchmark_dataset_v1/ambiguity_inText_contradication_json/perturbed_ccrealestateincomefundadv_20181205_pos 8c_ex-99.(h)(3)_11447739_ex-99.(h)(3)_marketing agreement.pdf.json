                "original_text": "S2K shall devote sufficient staff and expenditures to the performance of its services as shall be consistent with industry standards for the marketing of shares of the Fund. S2K shall perform these services in a professional and competent manner and shall provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as it determines may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to provide such services at no cost to the Distributor.",
                "changed_text": "S2K shall devote such staff and expenditures to the performance of its services as it deems appropriate for the marketing of shares of the Fund. S2K shall perform these services and shall provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as it determines may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to provide such services at no cost to the Distributor.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates efforts 'consistent with industry standards,' creating an objective benchmark. The modified text replaces this with 'as it deems appropriate,' introducing a subjective standard. This contradiction can lead to disputes over whether S2K is adequately fulfilling its marketing obligations. In particular, whether industry standards are applicable or S2K solely determines staff levels.",

For purposes of this Section 8, the term “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all information which is in any way connected with, derived from or related to the business of a party, including without limitation, any business and financial records, any retail or institutional customer information, computer programs, technical data, investment information, lists, compilations, compositions, programs, plans, devices, descriptions, drawings, methods, techniques, processes, designs, theories concepts or ideas, and any information relating to the pricing or marketing policies, suppliers or customers of a party.",
                "changed_text": "Each party to this Agreement shall safeguard and hold confidential from disclosure to unauthorized parties all Confidential Information (as defined below) of the other party or parties. For purposes of this Section 8, the term “Confidential Information” shall mean only business and financial records directly provided by one party to the other and explicitly marked as 'Confidential'.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' is broad, covering almost any business-related information. The modified definition is significantly narrower, limiting it to specific business and financial records explicitly labeled as 'Confidential'. This contradiction creates ambiguity regarding what information is actually protected under the confidentiality clause. The broader sense of the original text is in contradiction with the new definition. One section could be argued to protect against all derived information from the company, while the new section explicitly states that only the labelled records are confidential. ",

S2K is encouraged to produce, review, and file where necessary, in accordance with FINRA and SEC regulations and those of any jurisdiction in which a Fund is solicited through use of the Fund Materials. All expenses and costs attributable to the foregoing provision shall be shared equally between S2K and the Distributor. S2K shall remain liable for only the misrepresentations made by it in marketing materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that S2K 'shall be entitled' to produce materials with some requirements for compliance and bears all the costs. The modified version changes 'shall be entitled' to 'may', weakening the right to create the materials. The text also requires cost sharing now. Additionally, the original stated that S2K remains liable for any representations, but the changed section now only states that they are liable for 'misrepresentations', introducing a new legal standard that changes their responsibilities.",

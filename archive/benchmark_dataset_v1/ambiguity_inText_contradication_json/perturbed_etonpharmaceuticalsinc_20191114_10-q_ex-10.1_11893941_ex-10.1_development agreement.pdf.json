                "original_text": "1.31 “Product” or “Products” means a product or products set forth in Exhibit A for Marketing by or for ETON in the Territory (and covered or intended to be covered by a Dossier) and manufactured and supplied by Aucta (or a Third Party as permitted by this Agreement) to ETON in fully packaged and labeled form and ready for commercialization by ETON.",
                "changed_text": "1.31 “Product” or “Products” means a product or products set forth in Exhibit A for Marketing by or for ETON in the Territory (and covered or intended to be covered by a Dossier). The term explicitly excludes any product not fully compliant with all regulatory requirements at the time of delivery to ETON, regardless of its state of packaging or labeling.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Product' focuses on its intended use and form upon delivery. The modified definition adds a condition that the product must be fully compliant with regulations at delivery. This creates a contradiction because a product could be 'intended to be covered by a Dossier' and 'ready for commercialization' in fully packaged form, but still not fully compliant, leading to disputes over what constitutes a 'Product' under the agreement and impacting obligations related to marketing and sales.",

For the purposes of this definition, “control” means the ownership of at least 50% of the voting share capital of an entity or any other comparable equity or ownership interest.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 “Affiliates” means, with respect to a Party or any Third Party, any corporation, firm, partnership or other entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such entity. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means either (a) the ownership of at least 50% of the voting share capital of an entity, or (b) any arrangement where one party has the power to direct the management and policies of the other, regardless of equity ownership.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies 'control' as ownership of 50% of voting share capital. The modified version introduces an alternative definition based on the 'power to direct management,' regardless of ownership. This contradiction means a company could be considered an 'Affiliate' under one definition but not the other, impacting obligations related to information sharing, liability, and other clauses that apply to Affiliates.",

                "original_text": "11.2 Termination for Breach. The Agreement may be terminated by either Party by written notice to the other at any time if the other Party (the “Breaching Party”) is in material breach or default of any of its obligations hereunder or any of its representations or warranties as follows: (i) the terminating Party shall send a written notice of the material breach or material default to the Breaching Party and (ii) the termination shall become effective a) thirty (30) days after sending notice of the breach if the breach is non-payment of amounts due hereunder, such as milestone, minimum royalty or royalties amounts and b) sixty (60) days after sending notice of the breach for all other breaches unless the Breaching Party has cured any such material breach or material default prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) or sixty (60) day period as the case may be; or if for non-payment breaches such material default or material breach is not capable of being cured within such sixty (60) day period and the Breaching Party has commenced activities reasonably expected to cure such material breach or material default within such sixty (60) day period and thereafter uses diligent efforts to complete the cure as soon as practicable, but in no event shall such period exceed ninety (90) days.",
                "changed_text": "11.2 Termination for Breach. The Agreement may be terminated by either Party by written notice to the other at any time if the other Party (the “Breaching Party”) is in material breach or default of any of its obligations hereunder or any of its representations or warranties. Any failure to achieve a milestone payment outlined in Section 6 shall automatically constitute a material breach, leading to immediate termination without any cure period. All other breaches require (i) the terminating Party shall send a written notice of the material breach or material default to the Breaching Party and (ii) the termination shall become effective sixty (60) days after sending notice of the breach unless the Breaching Party has cured any such material breach or material default prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for a cure period for all material breaches, including non-payment. The modification states that failing to meet a milestone payment is an immediate, non-curable material breach. This contradiction introduces uncertainty because Section 6 outlines several milestones, and it's unclear whether all non-payments, or only specific milestones, trigger immediate termination, potentially leading to disputes over whether a valid termination occurred.",

For the purpose of this definition only, “control” (including, with correlative meaning, the terms “controlled by” and “under the common control”) means the actual power, either directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Party or other Person, whether by the ownership of 50% or more of the voting equity of such Party or other Person, by contract or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely with respect to Sections 1.61 (Major Biopharmaceutical Company), and 3.1 (Licenses to Sanofi), “Affiliates” will not include (a) with respect to an entity, its bona fide venture capital or private equity investors, (b) with respect to an entity, its bona fide institutional investors, provided that such institutional investors routinely make venture capital investments for the potential financial return on such investments and for so long as such institutional investors do not (x) obtain any rights (including options, rights to negotiate, rights of first refusal or other contingent rights) to acquire control of such entity or its assets or (y) enter into or agree to enter into any research, development, commercial, license or other strategic transaction with such entity (each investor in clause (a) and (b), an “Excluded Investor”), or (c) Affiliates of such venture capital, private equity or institutional investors that do not otherwise qualify as Affiliates of such entity under this Section 1.5 (i.e., for a reason other than by virtue of their status as Affiliates of such investors).",

                "explanation": "In the original text, Control is defined as owning 50% of the voting equity or through a contract. But in the changed text, control is only defined by contract and agreement. This will create ambiguity in determining which entities qualify as affiliates and hence which entities are bound by the contract.",

                "changed_text": "1.17 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means with respect to both Sanofi and RevMed: (a) efforts consistent with industry standards and practices commonly used by pharmaceutical companies of similar size and resources when developing and commercializing products with similar market potential, taking into account factors such as market exclusivity, safety and efficacy, product profile, regulatory environment, and competitive landscape.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides separate, detailed metrics for Sanofi and RevMed, creating a clear obligation. The modified version replaces this with a single, vague standard of \"industry standards and practices,\" making it difficult to objectively determine whether either party has met their obligations. This creates a **contradiction** because other parts of the agreement might rely on specific interpretations of Commercially Reasonable Efforts tailored to each party's capabilities.",

Reasonable deductions include (a) discounts for prompt payment; (b) customary trade discounts and rebates to wholesalers, chain drug stores, and managed care organizations; (c) credits or allowances actually granted upon rejections or returns of Products; (d) freight, shipping, and insurance charges, where such charges are included in the gross invoiced amount; (e) administration fees given to Group Purchasing Organizations; (f) price reductions, allowances, or rebates to governmental entities, including Medicaid and Medicare; (g) sales or use taxes, VAT, excise taxes, import duties, or other similar taxes; (h) distribution fees to distributors.  Any deductions not explicitly listed above must be approved by RevMed before being subtracted from gross sales.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies deductions \"determined in accordance with Accounting Standards\" and lists specific deduction types with [***]. The modified version replaces this with \"reasonable deductions\" and then includes a potentially conflicting constraint that unlisted deductions require RevMed's approval. Other sections could be using net sales calculated by original definitions, now there could be a conflict between the old section and new section on the net sales.",

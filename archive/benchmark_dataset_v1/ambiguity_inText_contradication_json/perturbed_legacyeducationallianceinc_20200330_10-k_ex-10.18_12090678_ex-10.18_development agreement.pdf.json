The term “Business” means a branded real estate seminar style education business that uses the Licensed Intellectual Property, including a to-be-determined trademark for the Business, to market and sell customers Products through any form of communication or media.",

The term “Business” means a branded real estate seminar style education business that primarily focuses on online webinars and digital content, explicitly excluding in-person seminars unless mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties. This business utilizes the Licensed Intellectual Property, including a to-be-determined trademark for the Business, to market and sell customers Products through any form of communication or media.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Business' is broad, encompassing any form of communication or media. The modified definition introduces a restriction, prioritizing online webinars and digital content while excluding in-person seminars unless explicitly agreed upon. This contradicts the original broad definition and creates uncertainty about the scope of 'Business.'",

The term “Licensed Intellectual Property” means solely the trademarks and trade names (whether registered or unregistered) directly and explicitly associated with the 'Tarek's Real Estate 101' brand. It explicitly excludes all Educational Materials, customer lists, concepts, methods, systems, programs, improvements, data, information, and works of authorship not bearing the registered 'Tarek's Real Estate 101' trademark.

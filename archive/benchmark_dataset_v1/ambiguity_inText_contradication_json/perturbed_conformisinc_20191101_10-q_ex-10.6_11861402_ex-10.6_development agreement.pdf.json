The modified definition restricts 'Invention' to ideas that are both patentable and copyrightable or trade secret, and require a higher standard (reduced to practice and memorialized). This ambiguity makes it unclear what constitutes an 'Invention' under the agreement, affecting IP ownership and rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that either party may terminate immediately, the modified text says with 30 days notice. Also, the original text states that there's no termination right if certain conditions are met, while in the modified text, it will exist regardless of the conditions. This introduces conflicting definitions of termination rights upon an Insolvency Event. The original clause states immediate termination, whereas the modified clause states termination after 30 days. This creates ambiguity regarding when the termination is effective, impacting obligations and winding down procedures.",

The servicer does not guarantee the accuracy of these reports.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by weakening the language of the Servicer's obligations. Phrases like 'some comparable device payment plan agreement receivables,' 'though not necessarily all of them,' 'when deemed appropriate,' 'selectively,' 'on a best effort basis,' 'accuracy is not guaranteed,' and 'some documents' all create loopholes and uncertainty regarding the Servicer's responsibilities. This contradicts the original intent of the section, which outlined clear and comprehensive servicing obligations. This change could allow the servicer to service in an arbitrary and self-serving way, as long as they could find some aspect of their behaviour that was reasonable.",

                "explanation": "Here, the mandatory 'will acquire' is replaced by the permissive 'may acquire', giving the servicer discretion where previously there was an obligation. The introduction of subjective qualifications like 'deems the breach significant', 'somewhat challenged,' and 'legitimate reason' create significant loopholes that make it difficult to enforce the acquisition requirement. This directly contradicts the purpose of the original section, which was designed to ensure that the Servicer bears the cost of its errors and deviations from agreed servicing procedures. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes over whether the Servicer is required to acquire specific Receivables.",

                "explanation": "The modified text uses significantly weaker and more ambiguous language than the original.

This could potentially lead to disputes over the Custodian's performance and whether it has adequately fulfilled its obligations. It's unclear what the 'some documents' will be, if the obligations won't be followed, and the ambiguity introduced has the potential to render this section unenforceable.",

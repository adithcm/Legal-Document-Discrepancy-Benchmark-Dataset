Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party agrees that, in its capacity as the Recipient of\nConfidential Information, it will (i) hold the Discloser’s Confidential Information in strict confidence, use a high degree of care\nin safeguarding the Discloser’s Confidential Information, and take all precautions necessary to protect the Discloser’s\nConfidential Information including, at a minimum, all precautions the Recipient normally employs with respect to its own\nConfidential Information, (ii) not divulge any of the Discloser’s Confidential Information or any information derived therefrom\nto any other person (except as set forth in Section 9.3 hereof), (iii) not make any use whatsoever at any time of the Discloser’s\nConfidential Information except as is necessary in the performance of Recipient’s specific duties under this Agreement, (iv)\nnot copy, reverse engineer, alter, modify, break down, melt down, disassemble or transmit any of the Discloser’s Confidential\nInformation, (v) not, within the meaning of United States or other export control laws or regulations, export or re-export,\ndirectly or indirectly, including but not limited to export on the Internet or other network service, any of the Discloser’s\nConfidential Information, (vi) notify the Discloser in writing immediately upon discovery by the Recipient or its\nRepresentatives of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Discloser’s Confidential Information, and (vii) upon the\ntermination or expiration of this Agreement, immediately return to the Discloser or destroy (at the option of the Recipient) all\nsuch Confidential Information, including all originals and copies.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces conflicting definitions regarding the handling of confidential information. The original text mandates strict confidentiality, prohibiting disclosure and use of confidential information except for specific duties. The modified text contradicts this by allowing potential disclosure, unrestricted use, and the option not to return or destroy confidential information. This creates uncertainty regarding the recipient's obligations concerning confidential data, potentially leading to legal disputes.",

                "explanation": "Original text is a warranty meaning that it HAS to follow the specification, but the modified text changes the liability into 'may or may not'. The introduction of these two makes for an uncertain agreement, as it is up to interpretation of the definition. A court may not see it as a warranty, which originally meant that Eutectix needed to comply with the specs provided.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifically defines a '30 day' cure period, but in the modified, it gives the right to 'a reasonable time period'. This makes the contract ambiguous due to the undefined timeframe and lack of accountability to cure the error. Reasonable is an adjective meaning that it is subjective to each party.",

                "original_text": "1.5 The term “Products” shall mean those certain products, specified by brand name, manufactured and marketed under the Trademarks by STAAR that are listed on Exhibit A-1 hereto. STAAR may from time to time modify or change the Products on Exhibit A-1 in its sole discretion, and if so, will notify Distributor promptly thereof. In the event that STAAR discontinues a Product, it will provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Distributor. Distributor shall not modify, disassemble or reverse engineer any Product, in whole or in part.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 The term “Products” shall mean those certain products, specified by brand name, manufactured and marketed under the Trademarks by STAAR that are listed on Exhibit A-1 hereto. STAAR may modify or change the Products on Exhibit A-1 with reasonable justification and after providing a 90-day notice to Distributor, or STAAR may remove the products without any notification or justification. In the event that STAAR discontinues a Product, it will provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Distributor. Distributor shall not modify, disassemble or reverse engineer any Product, in whole or in part.",
                "explanation": "This introduces conflicting conditions around STAAR’s ability to modify products. The original text allows STAAR to modify at its sole discretion. The modified version allows STAAR with justification and notification, and ALSO allows for removal without justification or notification, contradicting the notification requirement of modification and change the products on Exhibit A-1, thus creating ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "4.2 Payment for the Products shall be in U.S. Dollars, or such other currency as STAAR may require in its sole discretion, and made within thirty (30) days of STAAR’s invoice. Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "4.2 Payment for the Products shall be in U.S. Dollars, or such other currency as STAAR may require in its sole discretion, and made within ninety (90) days of STAAR’s invoice. Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month for the first month, and 5% per month thereafter.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states payment should be within 30 days. The modified text changes this to 90 days, creating a contradiction. The change in the late payment interest rate further complicates the section, because the original states interest charge is '1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.' while the changed text does not account for applicable laws, therefore introducing inconsistencies with payment terms.",

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise stated in this Agreement: (a) the foregoing Warranty is exclusive; and (b) all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded, whether express or implied (including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or against infringement). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the exclusive remedy for breach of the Warranty shall be, at STAAR’s option, the repair or replacement, at STAAR’s expense, of the non-conforming Product; provided that Distributor notifies STAAR of the non-conformity and returns the non-conforming Product within the Warranty Period.",
                "changed_text": "9.1 STAAR warrants that, for the period of six (6) months from the date of delivery to Distributor hereunder (the “Warranty Period”), the Products will meet STAAR’s published specifications or labeling for such Products as in effect at the time of such delivery (“Warranty”). Regardless of applicable law or other statements within this Agreement: (a) the warranty described herein is a courtesy, and STAAR reserves the right to refuse warranty requests for any reason; and (b) all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are included, especially any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or against infringement. The exclusive remedy for breach of the Warranty shall be, at Distributor's option, financial compensation equivalent to twice the original value of the non-conforming Product, or any other resolution determined by the Distributor; provided that Distributor notifies STAAR of the non-conformity within thirty (30) days of discovery, irrespective of the Warranty Period.",
                "explanation": "This introduces contradictions by changing the warranty period from 12 months to 6, and then stating that the distributor must discover non-conformity within 30 days regardless of the warranty period, creating ambiguity. The original agreement states that STAAR reserves the right to repair or replace the non-conforming product at their expense, and the changed version says that the distributor can decide on financial compensation or any resolution creating a conflict of interest.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Canadian advertisers' is changed from 'substantial places of business' to 'a mailing address'. This introduces a contradiction because an advertiser could have a mailing address in Canada without having a substantial business presence there. This creates ambiguity about who qualifies as a Canadian advertiser and who gets the revenue from their ads, potentially leading to disputes.",

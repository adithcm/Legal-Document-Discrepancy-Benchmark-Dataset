The Reseller shall have a right of first refusal to include within this Agreement any additional products developed, manufactured, or sold by the Company following the Effective Date that are not currently included in Exhibit A, and upon the exercise of such right, the term “Products” shall be expanded to mean such additional products as well. For purposes of clarity, the parties agree that upon Todos’s development of a blood screening test for colon cancer, such product shall be added to this Agreement and included within the definition of “Products”, subject to the Reseller and Todos agreeing on the commercial terms for such product, including the price.",

The modified clause changes this to 'reasonable time, expected to be ninety (90) days', creating ambiguity.

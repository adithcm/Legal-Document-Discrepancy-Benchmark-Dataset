                "explanation": "The original text states that the Steering Committee remains in force for the entire period of the JV, but the changed text limits it to the initial two years. This creates ambiguity about the Steering Committee's role beyond two years, potentially leading to disputes regarding its authority and decisions.",

                "explanation": "The original text specified a one-year notice for non-renewal, but the modified text shortens this to six months. This introduces inconsistency regarding the required notice period for terminating the agreement, which may cause conflict if one party attempts to terminate with less than a year's notice but more than six months.",

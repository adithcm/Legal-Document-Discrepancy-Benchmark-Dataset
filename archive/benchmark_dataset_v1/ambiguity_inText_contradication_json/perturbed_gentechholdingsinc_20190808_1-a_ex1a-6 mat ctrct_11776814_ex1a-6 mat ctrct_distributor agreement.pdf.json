                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Distributor Agreement, Company hereby appoints and grants Distributor the exclusive right to sell and distribute the Products to customers that Distributor introduce and confirmed by Company, (in all territory of United State of America (USA) and to render other services as a distributor for Company as set forth herein. Distributor shall limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and refrain from selling or otherwise transferring, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory, without the express written consent of Company. Company shall not sell or otherwise supply, directly or indirectly, the Products to any Distributor’s Customer’s, except by sale through the Distributor. The Company shall not contact any of Distributor’s Customer’s for any reason, without the prior written approval of Distributor.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Distributor Agreement, Company hereby appoints and grants Distributor the exclusive right to sell and distribute the Products to customers that Distributor introduce and confirmed by Company, (in all territory of United State of America (USA) and to render other services as a distributor for Company as set forth herein. Distributor shall generally limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and may sell or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory at its discretion. Company may sell or otherwise supply, directly or indirectly, the Products to any Distributor’s Customer’s, and the distributor will retain only the commission, for these sales. The Company shall contact any of Distributor’s Customer’s for any reason, without needing the prior written approval of Distributor.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants an exclusive right and restricts sales outside the territory without consent. The modified text removes the exclusivity, allowing sales outside the territory freely and allowing direct sales to Distributor's customers, which directly contradicts the initial grant of exclusive rights and creates confusion on the territory definition and commission. The first says exclusive, and the second says no.",

                "original_text": "All the negotiations between Company and Distributor will be by INCOTERMS Ex-works, in origin farm, in Brazil. So will must be respected the Transite Time to destiny delivery. Should Company fail to timely accept or reject an order from Distributor in accordance with this Section, such order shall be deemed accepted and shall become binding on Company. All orders shall be fulfilled by Company within Seven (7) business days of order acceptance.",
                "changed_text": "All the negotiations between Company and Distributor will be by INCOTERMS Delivered at Place (DAP), in the Distributor's warehouse. The Transite Time to destiny delivery is an estimated timeline and is not a guarantee. Should Company fail to timely accept or reject an order from Distributor in accordance with this Section, such order shall not be deemed accepted unless explicitly confirmed in writing by a company executive. All orders shall be fulfilled by Company within a reasonable timeframe after order acceptance, but no specific deadline is guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'Ex-works' INCOTERMS and a 7-day fulfillment deadline. The modified text changes the INCOTERMS to 'Delivered at Place (DAP),' removes the automatic acceptance of orders, and eliminates the guaranteed fulfillment deadline, all these conflicting with the previous definition on obligations. The first has a deadline and the second doesn't.",

Company shall have no control over or any liability in connection with the price at which Distributor resells the Products, and Distributor shall hold Company harmless and indemnify and defend Company from and against any liability resulting therefrom.",

Company retains the right to oversee and approve any promotional discounts or special offers proposed by Distributor, and Distributor shall hold Company harmless and indemnify and defend Company from and against any liability resulting therefrom. Distributor agrees that the prices should be the suggested retail price by Company, except when on Sales agreed with the company",
                "explanation": "The original grants the distributor full discretion over resale prices. The changed text imposes price controls and approval rights on the Company, directly contradicting the distributor's autonomy. The original gives freedom for the price, and the second dictates the price.",

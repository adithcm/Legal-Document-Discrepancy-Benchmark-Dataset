                "original_text": "1.1 iBio hereby grants to CC-Pharming for the term of this Agreement, a nonexclusive, non- assignable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to use iBio’s Technology in order to manufacture, process, prepare, and obtain regulatory approval for the development and production of Product(s) and work to be performed under this Agreement. Each Product will be set forth in a separate Statement of Work in the form set forth in Appendix A, which will be signed by representatives of each Party with signing authority. Each phase of the project(s) will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement unless otherwise provided for or in a Statement of Work (“SOW”), including but not limited to project purpose, project phases, and a project budget.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the terms of the 'iBio’s Technology' license granted to CC-Pharming. Initially, the license is 'nonexclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, limited,' but is now changed to 'nonexclusive, assignable, sublicensable, unlimited.' This creates uncertainty regarding the extent to which CC-Pharming can utilize and control the technology, potentially leading to disputes over usage rights, sublicensing, assignment of the technology to third parties, and the scope of the license.",

                "changed_text": "6.3 If either Party to this Agreement fails to perform or violates any material obligation of this Agreement, then, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the breaching Party specifying such failure or violation, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement with liability. This is the case regardless of (a) the failure or violation specified in the default notice having been cured within the thirty (30) day notice period; or (b) the failure or violation reasonably requiring more than thirty (30) days to correct, and the breaching Party having begun substantial corrective action to remedy the failure or violation within the thirty (30) day notice period and diligently pursuing such action, in which event, termination shall not be effective unless sixty (60) days has expired from the date of the default notice without such corrective action being completed and the failure or violation remedied.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding termination rights. The original clause allows termination without liability under certain conditions of breach and cure. The modified clause now states that termination will always be *with* liability, thus contradicting the possibility of termination without liability. This affects the cost and risk associated with terminating the agreement due to breach, as the breaching party may now always be liable for damages, where it was once not the case.",

Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right at all times to control and approve the nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon), and to inspect Licensee’s business operations upon reasonable prior notice for the purpose of ensuring that a high level of quality of the Licensed Products is being maintained by Licensee. At Licensor’s reasonable request during each calendar year, Licensee shall submit samples to Licensor, at no cost to Licensor, and shall not materially depart therefrom without Licensor’s prior express written consent. The Licensed Products, as well as all promotional, packaging and advertising material relative thereto, shall include all appropriate legal notices as required by Licensor. No more frequently than once per year, a third party auditor chosen by Licensor and approved by Licensee, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, shall be entitled at any time on reasonable notice to the Licensee to enter, during regular business hours, any premises used by the Licensee or its manufacturers for the manufacture, packaging or storage of the Licensed Products, to inspect such premises, all plant, workforce and machinery used for manufacture, packaging or storage of Licensed Products and all other aspects of the manufacture, packaging and storage of Licensed Products (“Access Rights”). Prior to exercising such Access Rights, the third party auditor shall enter into a nondisclosure agreement with Licensee that, among other terms deemed acceptable by Licensee and such third party auditor, shall: (a) limit the content of any report made by the third party auditor to Licensor to a description of the manner in which, and the conditions under which, the Licensed Mark are used by Licensee or its manufacturers; and (b) prevent the disclosure of any of Licensee’s trade secrets and/or Confidential Information. To the extent reasonably practicable, all Licensed Products shall include notices on labeling and packaging for the Licensed Products stating that the Licensed Mark is owned by Licensor and used by Licensee under license from Licensor. The Licensed Products shall be of a quality commensurate with previous production or the samples approved by Licensor. If the quality of a class of the Licensed Products falls below such standards, Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore such quality. In the event that Licensee has not taken appropriate steps to restore such quality within one-hundred twenty (120) days after notification by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",

Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right to control and approve the nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon). However, Licensor's approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Licensee's current quality control standards are deemed acceptable unless Licensor provides concrete evidence of a significant decline in quality that demonstrably harms the Licensed Mark's reputation. At Licensor’s reasonable request during each calendar year, Licensee shall submit samples to Licensor, at no cost to Licensor, and shall not materially depart therefrom without Licensor’s prior express written consent.

                "explanation": "Initially, Licensor had 'the right at all times to control and approve' quality. The modified text introduces a caveat that Licensor's approval 'shall not be unreasonably withheld,' effectively diminishing Licensor's previously absolute right, creating a contradiction that introduces ambiguity. The new text suggests Licensee’s existing standards are adequate without direct Licensor approval unless harm is demonstrated. This makes the level of Licensor’s control unclear.",

Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and shall fail to remedy any such default within one hundred twenty (120) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "4.2 Termination for Breach. Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder. However, termination is only permissible if the breach significantly and irreparably harms the other party's business interests and after a good-faith negotiation period of at least sixty (60) days aimed at finding a mutually acceptable resolution. The defaulting party shall be given one hundred twenty (120) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows termination for any material breach after a 120-day cure period. The modified text adds a condition that the breach must significantly and irreparably harm the other party's business interests and introduces a good-faith negotiation period of sixty (60) days which happens before the original 120 day cure period. This creates a contradiction regarding the grounds for termination and the process required, potentially conflicting with other sections of the agreement that may assume a broader definition of 'material breach'. It is not clear if you need to follow the negotiation period before even notifying about the breach, effectively extending the cure period. This means, in effect, the breaching party has up to 180 days (negotiation + cure).",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such consent of Licensor is required under this Agreement in the event of a Change of Control of Licensee so long as: (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person assumes all the obligations of the Licensee by operation of Law or pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Licensor; and (b) the licenses granted herein shall not be transferrable or sublicensable to Affiliates of such Person unless such Affiliates were Affiliates of Licensee prior to such Change of Control.",

For an assignment that is not a Change of Control of Licensee, the assignee must have a credit rating equal to or exceeding Licensee's credit rating at the time of original signing of the agreement and the assignee must follow compliance guidelines. For an assignment that is a Change of Control of Licensee, the Change of Control must comply with the governing regulations in the applicable jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Licensor's consent to an assignment 'shall not be unreasonably withheld', creating a reasonableness standard. The modified version states that 'consent shall be required, and shall be subject to due diligence' and that an assigneee must follow compliance guidelines, implying that Licensor can withhold consent as long as it completes due diligence and the guidelines are not followed, introducing a level of subjectivity, and the assignee must be of a specified credit. It also states that Change of Control must follow regulations, but Change of Control is only defined in relation to Licenses, so it could mean that regulations would only be followed if the Change of Control happens to involve Licenses. There are multiple levels of ambiguity between the changed and unchanged text.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Technology'. Initially, the definition explicitly excludes Patents and Trademarks. The modified version includes Patents and Trademarks under specific conditions outlined in Schedule J. However, Schedule J is nowhere to be found. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about which Intellectual Property Rights are included in Technology, potentially leading to disputes.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable (subject to Section 3.01(g)) license under the Nuance Patents, solely to the extent that claims of the Nuance Patents cover products or services of the SpinCo Business in the SpinCo Field of Use, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit such products and services, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof.",

This license is perpetual, provided that SpinCo maintains a market share of at least 10% within the SpinCo Field of Use. If SpinCo's market share falls below 10% for two consecutive years, the license automatically converts to a limited-term license, expiring five years from the date the market share threshold was breached.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a condition for the perpetual nature of the license grant in Section 3.01(a). The original text states that the license is 'perpetual and irrevocable,' while the modified text makes it conditional upon SpinCo maintaining a certain market share. If SpinCo's market share drops below the specified threshold, the license is no longer perpetual and converts to a limited-term license. This contradicts the initial grant and creates uncertainty regarding the duration of the license.",

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party’s assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party’s assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party’s Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, services or other activities of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation contradicts the limitation on extending licenses in Section 8.01. Initially, the agreement explicitly states that licenses will *not* extend to products, services, or activities of the assignee existing before the transaction date, unless previously licensed. The modified version states the *opposite*, that licenses *will* extend to such products and services upon the acquirer paying a percentage of the revenue (10%). This contradiction creates significant uncertainty as it now is ambiguous about the license extension to acquirers existing business, potentially leading to disputes.",

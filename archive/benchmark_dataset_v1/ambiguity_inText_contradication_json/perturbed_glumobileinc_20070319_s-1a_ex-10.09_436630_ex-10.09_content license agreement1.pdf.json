                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "“Voicetone” shall mean the audio speech sound heard by a caller, such as lines from a movie or spoken lyrics of a song.",
                "changed_text": "“Voicetone” shall mean any sound, including music or speech, heard by a caller while the call is routing. For the avoidance of doubt, this definition shall exclude any pre-recorded excerpt of a master recording of a musical composition.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction because the original definition is limited to speech sounds, while the modified version expands it to any sound, but then restricts it by excluding music excerpts, potentially conflicting with another definition elsewhere that might include music as a voicetone. This creates uncertainty in enforcement regarding which sounds qualify as voicetones and are therefore subject to the agreement’s terms.",

                "original_text": "(b)Waiver, Modification: The terms of this Agreement may not be waived or modified except by an agreement in writing executed by the parties hereto. The waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement by the other party must be in writing and shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any prior or succeeding breach.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Waiver, Modification: The terms of this Agreement may be modified by an agreement in writing executed by the parties hereto. However, either party’s conduct throughout the term of this agreement may imply a waiver of certain provision so long as such waiver is consistent and well documented, even if it’s not explicitly written. The waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement by the other party can be verbal and shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any prior or succeeding breach.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding how waivers can occur. The original text strictly requires written agreements for waivers, ensuring clarity and formality. The modified version contradicts this by stating that either party’s consistent conduct can imply a waiver, even without a written agreement. This creates ambiguity because it's unclear what constitutes ‘consistent conduct’ sufficient to imply a waiver, and it generates a conflict over whether a written agreement is always required, potentially complicating enforcement and opening avenues for disputes based on implied waivers.",

The date of mailing of a notice or statement shall be deemed the date the notice is given or statement rendered.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Notices: All notices and statements shall be in writing and shall together with any payments be sent to the intended party at the address set forth below (unless notification of a change of address is given in writing); payments can be made electronically. Notices may also be given via email, provided a confirmation of receipt is obtained. The date of transmission, if by email, or the date of mailing, if by post, of a notice or statement shall be deemed the date the notice is given or statement rendered.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by stating that 'All notices and statements shall be in writing' but then adds that 'Notices may also be given via email'. This conflicts with the initial requirement that all notices must be in writing, creating uncertainty about whether email notices are valid despite not strictly adhering to a 'writing' in the traditional sense.",

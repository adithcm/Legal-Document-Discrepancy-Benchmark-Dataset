                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Excite@Home Member(s)\" states that it includes users *regardless* of their sharing preferences, while the modified definition implies that an Excite@Home member *must* consent to share information. This creates a contradiction, particularly when considering data sharing implications later in the agreement. This contradiction affects which users fall into which category, impacting data usage rights and payment obligations.",

At a minimum, usage reports will include:\n          i)    Transactional Data on a sampling of Excite@Home Members who transact through the Co-Branded Application, as determined by Application Provider, (where available and as limited by Section 6.a.iii);\n          ii)   Summary data on Program Members, obscuring individual preferences, usage, and response rates;\n          iii)  Monthly page views by broad category groups; and\n          iv)   General information on response rates.\n     b)   Application Provider will retain ownership of all usage reports.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that usage reports should be provided on a weekly basis in mutually agreed format, where the change turns the period to monthly, format solely depend on Application Provider. Also, transactional data is only sample data, obscuring of individual data. The original agreement states co-ownership of usage reports, the modified version says Application Provider retains ownership. This creates conflicting obligations regarding the frequency, content, ownership, and level of detail of usage reports, making it difficult to enforce data sharing and transparency.",

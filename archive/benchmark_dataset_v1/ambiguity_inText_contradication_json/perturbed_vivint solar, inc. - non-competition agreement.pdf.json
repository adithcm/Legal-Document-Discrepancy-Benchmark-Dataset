Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Amendment will have the meaning set forth for that term in the Non-Competition Agreement or the Master Framework Agreement, dated September 30, 2016, by and between the Parties (the “Master Framework Agreement”).",

If a term is not defined in the Non-Competition Agreement, then it will have the meaning commonly understood in the solar energy industry, regardless of any definition in the Master Framework Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This creates conflicting definitions by prioritizing industry understanding over the Master Framework Agreement for undefined terms, whereas the original text defers to the Master Framework Agreement. If the Non-Competition Agreement and the Master Framework Agreement define the same term differently, it creates uncertainty about which definition prevails.",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue for a period of five years. The non-solicitation obligations will however automatically extend beyond five years if the Sales Term as defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the “Sales Dealer Agreement”), has not expired, but shall never exceed ten years.”",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly ties the 'Term' to the 'Sales Term' in the Sales Dealer Agreement. The modified text introduces a fixed term of five years, while also allowing for extension based on the Sales Dealer Agreement's 'Sales Term,' but capped at ten years. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual duration of the non-solicitation agreement, which could lead to disputes about its termination date.",

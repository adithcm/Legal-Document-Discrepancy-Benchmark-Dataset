                "original_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",
                "changed_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, except for the confidentiality clauses outlined in the Original Agreement, which shall remain in effect for a period of one year following termination.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the survival of provisions from the Original Agreement. The original clause states that NO provisions survive, but the modified clause indicates that confidentiality clauses DO survive, creating uncertainty and a basis for dispute.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Termination Agreement represents the complete, integrated, and entire agreement between the parties. Amendments can be made verbally, with verbal confirmation by both parties and documented in the meeting minutes.",
                "explanation": "The original clause enforces written modification only. The modified clause allows for verbal modifications, with a record in the meeting minutes. This directly contradicts the written requirement and opens the door for disputes about the validity of verbal amendments.",

                "changed_text": "5. This Termination Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto. However, it cannot be assigned or transferred to any successor without the explicit written consent of both original parties, except in cases of mergers or acquisitions.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows the agreement to benefit successors and assigns. The modified clause restricts this benefit by requiring explicit written consent for assignment, except in limited circumstances (mergers/acquisitions), making the scope of 'successors and assigns' unclear and potentially leading to disputes regarding which successors are actually bound by the agreement.",

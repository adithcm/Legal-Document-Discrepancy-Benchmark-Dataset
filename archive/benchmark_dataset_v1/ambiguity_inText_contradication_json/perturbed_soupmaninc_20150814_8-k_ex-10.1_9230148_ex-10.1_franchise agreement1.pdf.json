                "original_text": "You shall pay us all Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees and Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, due under this Section 4 by electronic funds transfer by us against a bank account maintained by you. You agree to execute the documents required by us, our bank and/or your bank in order to permit us to conduct electronic funds transfers to and from your account, and you shall not close your account without our prior consent. Your failure to comply with the terms of this Section 4.3 shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement. You hereby authorize us to initiate debit entries and/or credit collection entries to your bank account for the payment of Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, and all other sums that may become due to us or our affiliates from you.",
                "changed_text": "You will endeavor to pay us all Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees and Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, due under this Section 4 by electronic funds transfer by us against a bank account maintained by you. You agree to execute the documents required by us, our bank and/or your bank in order to permit us to conduct electronic funds transfers to and from your account, and you may close your account with our prior consent. Your failure to comply with the terms of this Section 4.3 shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement. You authorize us to consider debit entries and/or credit collection entries to your bank account for the payment of Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, and all other sums that may become due to us or our affiliates from you.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall pay' with 'will endeavor to pay,' making payment non-mandatory. It also changes 'shall not close' to 'may close', giving the franchisee the option to close the account. The original contract clearly stated that failure to comply was a breach, but now it is not. This creates an internal contradiction if another part of the contract enforces strict adherence to Section 4.3.",

We shall provide such training, instructors, a training manual, and other materials without charge to ,five_(5) persons, but if you request to send additional attendees to our master franchisee training program you shall pay our then-current training fee for each additional attendee sent to such training program by you. Except as stated in the preceding sentence, you shall be responsible for any and all other expenses incurred in connection with sending your managers to such training including, without limitation, the costs of transportation, lodging, meals, and any wages. We shall, in our sole discretion, select the time and location of the initial training program. We shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if, at any time during the initial training program, we conclude (in our sole judgment) that you or your principal do not appear to possess the skills necessary to properly fulfill and discharge the demands and responsibilities required by the System or this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Prior to the Commencement Date, you (or, if you are a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, a principal of yours acceptable to us, regardless of their equity interest in you) and any of your managers shall attend and exert commercially reasonable efforts to complete the initial training program for master franchisees offered by us. We shall provide such training, instructors, a training manual, and other materials without charge to ,five_(5) persons, and if you request to send additional attendees to our master franchisee training program you may not be able to pay our then-current training fee for each additional attendee sent to such training program by you. Except as stated in the preceding sentence, we are responsible for any and all other expenses incurred in connection with sending your managers to such training including, without limitation, the costs of transportation, lodging, meals, and any wages. You shall, in our discretion, select the time and location of the initial training program. We shall have no right to terminate this Agreement if, at any time during the initial training program, we conclude that you or your principal do not appear to possess the skills necessary to properly fulfill and discharge the demands and responsibilities required by the System or this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions by altering the requirements for attending and completing the training program. The original contract states that the principal must own at least 25% equity, but now it doesn't matter. Also, the original contract says that the attendance must complete the training to our satisfaction, but now it's the attendees that make efforts. The new contract also says that the master franchisee is the decider of the training program time and locations. This is in contradiction if another part of the contract enforces strict adherence to the training program policies.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces conflict by stating the franchisee *does* have the right to establish policies outside those designated, directly contradicting the original text. The original contract clearly states that the Franchisees are bound to the franchisor's policies. By changing the word 'our' to 'your', this creates an internal contradiction if another part of the contract enforces strict adherence to company established procedures and policies.",

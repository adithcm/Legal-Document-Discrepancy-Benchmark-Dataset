Except as provided in Section 2.3, Licensee’s use of the Licensed Domain Names under the terms of this Agreement shall be free of any fees.",

                "explanation": "The term 'exclusive' has been changed to 'non-exclusive', creating a contradiction. Section 2.1(a) now states the Licensee does *not* have exclusive rights, impacting Licensee’s market position.",

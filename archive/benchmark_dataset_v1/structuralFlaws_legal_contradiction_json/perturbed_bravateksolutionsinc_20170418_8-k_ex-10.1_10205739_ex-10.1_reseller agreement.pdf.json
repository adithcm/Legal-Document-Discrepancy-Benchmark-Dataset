                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction to be determined at the sole discretion of the Company, notwithstanding any conflicts of law.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Virginia law governs the contract. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by allowing the Company to choose the governing law later. This is contradictory because it voids the initial agreement on governing law, potentially violating legal standards requiring clarity and mutual consent in contract terms.",

                "explanation": "Changing the specified time period creates a contradiction. By setting the time period to indefinite, the lack of a set time for payments goes against common practice, weakening the enforceability of the payment terms and potentially violating contract law requirements for definite terms.",

                "explanation": "The modification negates the restriction on reseller warranties, creating a direct contradiction. This changes the risk and responsibility related to product representations, which are often legally regulated to protect consumers and ensure accurate product claims.",

To the extent that the value of current life insurance coverage is taxable income, it will be subject to withholding requirements and will be reported as income by the Employer to the IRS and state-taxing authorities on the Employee's W-2 Form or other IRS or state-required reporting form to the extent required by law.",

                "explanation": "Moving the tax responsibility clause to the 'Interpretation' section buries a critical financial disclosure in boilerplate language, making it less noticeable to the employee. This obscurement could lead to misunderstandings regarding tax obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Pennsylvania law. The modification introduces ambiguity by suggesting 'general business principles' and 'fairness and equity as determined by the Employer' can override state law.

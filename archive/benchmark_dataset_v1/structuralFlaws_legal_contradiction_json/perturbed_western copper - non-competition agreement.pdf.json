Any remedy \nexpressly set forth in this ยง3.1 wall be in addition to and not inclusive of or dependent upon the \nexercise of any other remedy available to Glamis at law or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "Western Copper acknowledges and agrees that a breach of its covenants contained \nin this Agreement would result in damage to Glamis that could not adequately be compensated \nfor by monetary award alone.

                "explanation": "Moving the sentence alters the logical flow, making it harder to understand Western Copper's obligations and Glamis's right to seek remedies. The logical connection between the acknowledgement of damages and the immediate entitlement to remedies is weakened.",

The parties may agree that the law governing this agreement shall be the laws of Nevada. The parties attorn to the exclusive \njurisdiction of the Courts of British Columbia.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence introduces a contradiction in the governing law clause. It first states that British Columbia law applies, but then adds a clause allowing parties to choose Nevada law. This ambiguity creates uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws govern the contract, undermining the clause's purpose.",

                "explanation": "By removing the 'unless otherwise clearly provided' clause, any single waiver is now implied to be a continuing waiver, contradicting the original intention that waivers should be explicitly defined as continuing.

Without limiting Section ​16.08, any and all disputes or claims arising from either Party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration. Any arbitration commenced with respect to a dispute or claim under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and the Supplementary Procedures for Large, Complex Disputes then in effect (the “Rules”), except to the extent such rules conflict with this Section ​13. In any arbitration, New York law shall govern, except to the extent that such law conflicts with the Rules or this Section ​13. The Parties further agree that each issue submitted for arbitration be submitted to a panel of three (3) impartial arbitrators with each Party selecting one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of the arbitration period and the two (2) selected arbitrators selecting a third arbitrator who is experienced in the commercial retail industry within thirty (30) days after the commencement of the arbitration period. Any arbitration hereunder shall commence within thirty (30) days after appointment of the third arbitrator and shall be held in New York, New York, USA. No discovery by either Party shall be permitted unless the arbitrators determine that the Party requesting such discovery has a substantial, demonstrable need. The arbitrators shall make final determinations as to any discovery disputes and all other procedural matters. If any Party fails to comply with the procedures in any arbitration in a manner deemed material by the arbitrators, then the arbitrators shall fix a reasonable time for compliance, and if the Party does not comply within such period, then a remedy deemed just by the arbitrators, including an award of default, may be imposed. The decision of the arbitrators shall be rendered no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after commencement of the arbitration period. The costs of arbitration shall be borne by the Party against whom the arbitral decision is made. Any judgment or decision rendered by the panel shall be binding upon the Parties and shall be enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "The restructuring of the sentence introduces contradiction—the first part states arbitration is mandatory, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on the method of arbitration. This contradicts the original clause's strict arbitration requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Adding a caveat to the insurance clause that insurance is only required if 'economically feasible' creates a legal contradiction. The original clause unequivocally states that XSPA 'shall obtain' the specified insurance. Introducing the 'economically feasible' qualification makes the requirement ambiguous and weakens enforceability. It introduces uncertainty as to what constitutes 'economically feasible,' which could be interpreted differently by the parties involved.",

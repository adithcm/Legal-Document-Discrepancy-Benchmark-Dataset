                "original_text": "All notices, requests and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by\ncourier or other means of personal service (including by means of a nationally recognized courier service or\nprofessional messenger service), or sent by telex or telecopy or mailed first class, postage prepaid, by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested, in all cases, addressed as indicated in the introductory recital of this\nAgreement.",
                "changed_text": "All notices, requests and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and may be delivered by any means convenient to both parties. There is no requirement for formal notification processes.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a precise procedure for delivering notices, requests, and communications. The modified text introduces uncertainty by allowing any means of delivery, negating the need for verifiable delivery methods such as certified mail or courier services. This could lead to disputes over whether notice was properly given, affecting the enforceability of clauses dependent on timely notification. Moving the arbitration clause impacts its visibility and enforceability, conflicting with standard legal practices that advocate for clear and conspicuous arbitration agreements.",

Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be\nentered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief in\npursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including\nthe plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration.",
                "changed_text": "Any controversy regarding the color of the website's font shall be decided by the CEO of Digicorp, Inc.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated arbitration for disputes, ensuring a structured dispute resolution process. The modified text replaces this with a CEO's decision for font color only, effectively removing the arbitration clause and leaving most disputes unresolved, or subject to standard court procedures. This contradicts the intent of the original clause and reduces the enforceability of any structured dispute resolution method. By removing the arbitration clause and only making a determination on the font, there is a contradiction. The previous clause stated that all disagreements shall be settled by arbitration. The change of the clause only states font.",

HOWEVER, LIABILITY OF\nCONTENT PROVIDER FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE IS LIMITED TO $1. ",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clause that limits the overall monetary liability. This has been modified to allow 'however, liability of Content Provider for gross negligence is limited to $1'. This introduces uncertainty and potential unenforceability as the standard of 'gross negligence' is highly subjective and fact-dependent, conflicting with the intent of the clause. It could undermine the purpose of limiting potential financial exposure, particularly since California law does recognize gross negligence. Limiting the potential liability to $1 may also be unenforceable.",

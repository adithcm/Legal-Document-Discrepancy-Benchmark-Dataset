In the event that such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) Business Days following such notice,\neither Party may upon the expiration of the such 30-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International\nArbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect. The arbitration shall be conducted in Hong\nKong in English and the arbitral award shall be binding upon both Parties. During the resolution (including the arbitration) of the\ndispute, the Parties shall continue to perform other portions of this Agreement unaffected by such dispute.",

In the event that such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) Business Days following such notice,\neither Party may upon the expiration of the such 30-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration if both parties agree, otherwise either party may seek resolution in a jurisdiction of their choosing. The arbitration, if agreed upon, shall be conducted in Hong\nKong in English and the arbitral award shall be binding upon both Parties only if both parties consent to the outcome. During the resolution of the\ndispute, the Parties shall continue to perform other portions of this Agreement unaffected by such dispute.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'if both parties agree, otherwise either party may seek resolution in a jurisdiction of their choosing,' the mandatory arbitration clause is weakened. Furthermore, making the arbitral award binding 'only if both parties consent to the outcome' undermines the purpose of arbitration, which is to provide a binding resolution. This reduces the enforceability of the original dispute resolution mechanism.",

                "explanation": "Weakens security of Program Content. Changing 'all technical methods and confidential measures reasonably available' to 'some technical methods available' reduces the required level of effort for protecting the content. Removing 'Without Party A's permission in writing, Party B may not disclose or sublicense the Program Content to any third party, except for the Program Content related to Party B Business' and replacing with 'With Party A’s permission, Party B may disclose or sublicense the Program Content to any third party, including program content that is not related to Party B Business.' drastically changes the confidentiality and licensing terms, allowing Party B to freely sublicense content even if it is not related to their business, given Party A's permission.",

                "explanation": "Weakens the consequence of breach. Changing 'shall constitute a breach' to 'may constitute a breach' makes the determination of a breach discretionary. Replacing 'shall indemnify... for all of such other Parties losses' with 'may indemnify... for only some of such other Parties losses' reduces the obligation to compensate for losses and limits the scope of compensation.",

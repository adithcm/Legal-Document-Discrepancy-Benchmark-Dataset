                "original_text": "2.2. Compliance With Laws. Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business and shall notify Licensor of any action that must be taken by Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "changed_text": "5.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to such subject matter.\n2.2. Compliance With Laws. Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with some laws, rules and regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business and may notify Licensor of any action that must be taken by Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "explanation": "Moving the Compliance with Laws clause to the 'Entire Agreement' section buries it among general provisions, making it less prominent. The change in wording from 'all laws' to 'some laws' and from 'shall notify' to 'may notify' significantly weakens the licensee's obligation to comply with regulations and inform the licensor, which could be seen as a violation of general corporate compliance standards, but more specifically a violation of compliance laws.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'unless both parties agree to another state' and 'contingent on mutual agreement', the governing law and jurisdiction clauses are weakened. The original clause establishes a clear, enforceable jurisdiction. The modification introduces ambiguity, which can lead to disputes about which jurisdiction applies, undermining the certainty that parties rely on when entering an agreement.",

                "explanation": "Moved the privacy clause to follow the 'Maintenance of System' clause, obscuring its importance. Privacy policies under laws like GDPR and CCPA are required to be easily accessible and clearly stated, not buried within unrelated sections.",

The modification allows VOTOCAST to choose the jurisdiction for disputes, potentially disadvantaging Licensee by forcing them to litigate in an inconvenient or biased location.

If circumstances require VOTOCAST to raise its rates more than ten percent (10%) during any Renewal Term, VOTOCAST will provide Licensee cost related supporting documentation to justify the rate increase.

                "explanation": "Removed the provision limiting rate increases to 10% during any renewal term. This absence permits VOTOCAST to significantly raise fees upon renewal without limitation which can render the contract unreasonably favorable to VOTOCAST and thus possibly unenforceable.",

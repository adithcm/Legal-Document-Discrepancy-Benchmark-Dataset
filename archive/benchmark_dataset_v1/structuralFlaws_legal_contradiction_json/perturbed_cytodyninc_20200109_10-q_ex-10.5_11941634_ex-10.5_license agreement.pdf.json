In connection with the Parties’ rights under this Article 12, EACH PARTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED\nBY LAW, KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL\nPROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS IT CONTEMPLATES. THIS WAIVER APPLIES\nTO ANY ACTION OR LEGAL PROCEEDING, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE.",
                "changed_text": "1.114 “Trial Waiver” means that, concerning the Parties’ rights under this Article 12, EACH PARTY has the OPTION to WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS IT CONTEMPLATES. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO ANY ACTION OR LEGAL PROCEEDING, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states a waiver of the right to a jury trial. By moving this clause to the definition section and rephrasing it as an 'option' to waive, the enforceability of the waiver is significantly undermined. This creates a legal contradiction because the contract implies a choice that may not be legally valid, especially in jurisdictions where jury trial waivers must be knowing and intentional.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains an important disclaimer of warranties. By moving the disclaimer of warranties to a new section titled 'Hypothetical Scenario', there is ambiguity about whether it is an actual term of the contract, or just a hypothetical scenario.

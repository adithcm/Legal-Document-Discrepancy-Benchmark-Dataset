                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without reference to its choice of law rules. Sponsor hereby irrevocably consents to personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California with respect to any actions, claims or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction to be mutually agreed upon by both parties at the time of any dispute, without reference to its choice of law rules. Sponsor hereby consents to personal jurisdiction and venue in a location also to be determined by mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies California law and San Francisco courts. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating the governing law and venue will be decided later, contradicting the initial, clear agreement. This could make dispute resolution more complex and unpredictable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Choice of Law and Venue clauses. While not directly violating a specific law, it weakens the enforceability of standard contract provisions.",

Each party shall take, at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information (and in any event, at least reasonable measures) to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that its breach of the provisions of this Section 8.1  [CONFIDENTIALITY] will result in immediate and irreparable harm to the other and that money damages alone would be inadequate to compensate such party.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, the receiving party will make reasonable efforts not to disclose Confidential Information. However, this obligation does not apply if disclosure is deemed necessary for business development purposes. Each party acknowledges that its breach of the provisions of this Section 8.1  [CONFIDENTIALITY] will be handled through good-faith negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibits disclosure of confidential information for five years post-term and acknowledges that breaches would cause irreparable harm. The modified version weakens this by: (1) changing the obligation to 'reasonable efforts', (2) introducing an exception for 'business development purposes' which is vague and easily abused, and (3) changing the remedy to 'good-faith negotiation' which is less stringent than acknowledging irreparable harm.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Confidentiality clauses. The modification introduces ambiguity and weakens the protection of confidential information, making enforcement difficult.",

Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, enforceable by, and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.",
                "changed_text": "Neither party may assign this Agreement without notifying the other party. However, either party may freely assign its payment obligations to any third party. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon the parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause restricts assignment of the agreement without consent, with limited exceptions. The modified version permits free assignment of payment obligations, which could negatively impact a party if the assignee is unreliable. The removal of 'enforceable by, and inure to the benefit of...successors and assigns' also weakens the agreement's long-term binding nature.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Assignment clauses. Modifying the assignment clause creates uncertainty and could disadvantage one party by allowing unchecked transfer of payment obligations.",

The developer shall not develop, maintain or market a similar platform and will not compete with the Client directly or indirectly worldwide.",
                "explanation": "Moved the non-compete clause from the 'Parties' Representations and Warranties' section to the 'Governing Law' section. Non-compete clauses are usually stand-alone sections within the contract and are not included in governing law clauses. This misplacement obscures its importance and enforceability and makes it difficult to find.",

All intellectual property developed pursuant to this Agreement before the Termination Date shall be delivered to the Client within one day of the Termination Date.",
                "explanation": "Moved the clause regarding intellectual property delivery upon termination from 'Responsibilities after Termination' to 'Types of Termination'. This relocation is problematic because the delivery of intellectual property is a consequence of termination, not a type of termination itself. By inserting it within the 'Types of Termination', it creates confusion and could be misinterpreted as a condition for termination rather than an obligation after termination.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles require clarity in defining the conditions for termination and the obligations arising from it. Misplacing a post-termination obligation within the definition of termination types undermines this clarity.",

                "explanation": "Moved the clause obligating the Developer to execute documents for IP transfer from the 'Work for Hire' section to the 'Notice' section, specifically embedding it within the Client's contact information. By doing this, the requirement is obfuscated and made less likely to be noticed, understood, or acted upon correctly. It disrupts the logical flow of the notice provision and buries a significant obligation within administrative contact details. If the developer is seeking to avoid completing IP assignment obligations, the placement of this clause in the Notice section is designed to avoid easy viewing.",

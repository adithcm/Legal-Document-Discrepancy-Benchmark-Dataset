                "explanation": "The relocation of the compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws and Prohibited Conduct disclosure to the No Third Party Beneficiaries section makes it less discoverable and less likely to be enforced.

                "explanation": "Moving the Rights in Bankruptcy disclosure to the Technology Transfer makes it less discoverable and enforceable because Technology Transfer does not immediately signal bankruptcy.

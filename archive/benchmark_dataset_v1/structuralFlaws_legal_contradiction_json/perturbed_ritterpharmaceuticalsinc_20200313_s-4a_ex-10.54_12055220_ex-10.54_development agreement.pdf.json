                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties prohibits, or is intended in any manner to prohibit, either Sekisui or Qualigen from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Sekisui and Qualigen do not need the prior authorization of anyone at the other Party or the other Partyâ€™s legal counsel to make any such reports or disclosures and they are not required to notify the other Party that it has made such reports or disclosures.",
                "changed_text": "For the avoidance of doubt related to Section 13.1, whistleblower protections are extended to the end of the calendar year of 2016.",
                "explanation": "The original whistleblower protection clause has been moved to the confidentiality section (13.1) and has been limited in time. This reduces the clarity and enforceability of whistleblower protections, and limits its scope in time. Also some jurisdictions require whistleblower protection clauses to be easily accessible.",

                "original_text": "Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of laws principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be inapplicable to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "For additional clarity as it applies to this Agreement, Section 11 (Indemnities) is to be governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause is now contradicted by stating Section 11 follows the laws of the British Virgin Islands. This creates a contradiction and ambiguity, reducing enforceability, as most parties would assume the entire contract is subject to Delaware law.",

Qualigen shall have responsibility to determine whether any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections information must be reported to the FDA (under United States law) or any other Regulatory Authorities and Qualigen shall have responsibility to prepare and submit notification of Adverse Events, Recalls and/or Field Corrections to respective Regulatory Authorities for the Products. Qualigen shall provide prompt notice to Sekisui of any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections, which notice shall in any event be delivered within no more than 3 business days from Qualigen learning of such occurrence.",
                "changed_text": "From time to time, the parties may consult with the regulatory authorities for marketing guidance.",
                "explanation": "This original paragraph detailed the important procedure that Qualigen will handle adverse events, recalls, and field corrections. By removing this and replacing it with general marketing consultation, it makes the disclosure difficult to find and implement.",

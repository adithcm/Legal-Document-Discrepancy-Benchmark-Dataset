In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, the Blockchain Administrator agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund shall at all times remain the property of the Fund, shall be readily accessible during normal business hours, and shall be promptly surrendered upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request. The Blockchain Administrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be preserved for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided above. Records shall be surrendered in usable machine-readable form. The Blockchain Administrator shall have the right to retain copies of such records subject to observance of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Blockchain Administrator shall have the right to retain copies of such records subject to observance of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement. The Blockchain Administrator agrees to maintain and keep all books, accounts and other records of the Fund that relate to activities performed by the Blockchain Administrator hereunder and will maintain and keep such books, accounts and records, availability of which is dependent upon the Blockchain Administrator's discretion and internal policies. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, the Blockchain Administrator agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund shall be promptly surrendered upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request, provided that a reasonable fee may be charged for the retrieval and processing of such records. The Blockchain Administrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be preserved for a period of one year, after which they may be destroyed or archived at the Blockchain Administrator's discretion unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided above. Records shall be surrendered in a format determined by the Blockchain Administrator. ",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states compliance with the Investment Company Act regarding record-keeping. The modified clause contradicts this by limiting the availability and altering the preservation terms of those records, potentially violating record-keeping requirements under the Investment Company Act.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon 60 days' written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by the vote of the Fund's Trustees or by the Blockchain Administrator.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, but termination by the Fund requires payment of a termination fee equivalent to one year's worth of fees, unless the Blockchain Administrator consents to waiving such fee. Termination may occur upon 60 days' written notice by the Blockchain Administrator.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states 'without the payment of any penalty'. The modified version introduces a termination fee for the Fund, contradicting the initial no-penalty clause. This creates a conflict that could lead to disputes over the enforceability of termination terms.",

In such case, to the extent the applicable laws of the State of New York, or any of the provisions herein, conflict with the provisions of the Investment Fund Act, the latter shall control.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws principles, unless the Blockchain Administrator elects to apply the laws of its principal place of business, and any disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration in a jurisdiction of the Blockchain Administratorâ€™s choosing. The Blockchain Administrator's interpretation of this agreement shall be binding on the fund.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies New York law and the Investment Fund Act as governing laws. The modified version introduces Delaware law but allows the Blockchain Administrator to choose the governing law and arbitration jurisdiction, giving them undue control. Also, specifying that the Blockchain Administrator's interpretation of the agreement shall be binding on the fund contradicts the standard principle of mutual agreement and equal interpretation rights. Arbitration requirements must be clearly stated under New York and Delaware law, not decided at the discretion of one party.",

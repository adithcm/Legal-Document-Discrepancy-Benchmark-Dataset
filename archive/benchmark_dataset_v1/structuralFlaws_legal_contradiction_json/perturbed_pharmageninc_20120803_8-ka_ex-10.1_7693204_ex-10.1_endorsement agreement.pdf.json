In connection with any HDS' usage of Celebrity Attributes as outlined above in Paragraphs 3(A)-(C), HDS will \nfeature the following disclaimer in close proximity to said usage: \"PAUL SILAS IS NOT A MEDICAL \nAUTHORITY. THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG \nADMINISTRATION. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, CURE OR PREVENT \nANY DISEASE.\"",

                "explanation": "The original text included a disclaimer stating that Paul Silas is not a medical authority and that the product's claims have not been evaluated by the FDA. This disclosure is essential for compliance with advertising and consumer protection laws, particularly regarding health-related products. By replacing this disclaimer with a general statement of excitement, the modified text removes a crucial protection for consumers, potentially misleading them about the endorsements of Clotamin.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that courts in Cobb County have personal jurisdiction over the parties and are the exclusive venue for disputes. The modified text changes 'shall have personal jurisdiction' to 'may have personal jurisdiction' and 'exclusive venue' to 'non-exclusive venue.' By weakening the mandatory nature of the original clause, the modified text introduces ambiguity and makes it more difficult to enforce the agreement in a specific jurisdiction. This is because it opens the door for disputes to be heard in other jurisdictions, potentially leading to increased litigation costs and uncertainty.",

The modified text changes the exclusion to an affirmative duty. Now, HDS *is* obligated to indemnify Celebrity if Celebrity's active negligence or willful misconduct causes the damage. This alteration creates a contradiction in the standard indemnification principles, placing an unusual and potentially unenforceable burden on HDS.",

                "changed_text": "3. This Termination Agreement may be modified with verbal consent from both parties, in contradiction to the clause stating this agreement may not be modified except in writing. This Termination Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the PRC, without regard to conflicts of law principles.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Termination Agreement represents the complete, integrated, and entire agreement between the parties. However, any part of this agreement may be terminated by either party with a 24-hour notice, as it relates to marketing promotions. And may not be modified except in writing signed by the parties.",
                "explanation": "The addition contradicts the completeness clause by suggesting some parts can be terminated easily, impacting the entire agreement's stability and enforcement. This could lead to disputes about which parts are truly 'complete' and integrated.",

                "explanation": "Introducing 'This agreement is also not binding.' directly contradicts the original sentence, making the entire clause confusing and unenforceable. It creates a fundamental contradiction regarding the agreement's legal effect.",

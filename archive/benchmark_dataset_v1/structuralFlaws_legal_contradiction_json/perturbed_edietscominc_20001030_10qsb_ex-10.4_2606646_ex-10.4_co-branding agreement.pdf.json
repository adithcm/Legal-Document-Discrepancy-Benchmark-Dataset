The parties agree that all lawsuits arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in the state of California, San Francisco County, and each party hereby referred consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts for such purpose.\n         15.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California as applied to agreements made, entered into and performed entirely in California by California residents, notwithstanding the actual residence of the parties, without giving effect to any choice of laws of California that would require the application of the laws of a state other than California.",

                "explanation": "The jurisdiction and venue clause mandating California courts is moved to Section 1.4 (Expenses) and altered to allow the initiating party to choose the jurisdiction. This makes it difficult to enforce the original intent of resolving disputes in California, creating a legal contradiction that favors the party initiating the legal action. By the move to Section 1.4 this is not properly placed in a dispute resolution section.",

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.\n                  11.9 Entire Agreement.

                "explanation": "Moving the 'Applicable Law, Venue' and 'Waiver of Jury Trial' clauses to before 'Counterparts' disrupts the logical flow and places them in a less conspicuous position. This could make it more difficult for a party to readily find and understand these critical clauses related to legal jurisdiction and rights, potentially weakening their enforceability. Some courts may view such placement as an attempt to obscure these clauses.",

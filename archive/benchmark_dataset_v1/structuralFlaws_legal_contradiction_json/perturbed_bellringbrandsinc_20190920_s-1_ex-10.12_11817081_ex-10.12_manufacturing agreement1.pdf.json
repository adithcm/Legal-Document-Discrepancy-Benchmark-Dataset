                "explanation": "The original section outlines Heritage's responsibilities regarding product manufacturing, packaging, and compliance. The modified version swaps sub-sections (ii) and (iv). This reordering buries the compliance with laws and regulations, making it less prominent and potentially weakening its enforceability. It obfuscates Heritage's explicit commitment to comply with FDA regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that disputes will be resolved in San Francisco, California, under California law. The modified clause removes the specific location (San Francisco, California) for venue and changes governing law to Delaware. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the initial, clearer agreement on jurisdiction and applicable law. This can lead to confusion and legal challenges in determining where and under what laws disputes should be resolved.",

                "explanation": "The change omits the phrase \"and any related Establishment Inspection Report (“EIR”)\" from the text. This weakens the disclosure requirement because the FDA 483 form references the EIR. By removing the EIR, the disclosure of the FDA 483 on its own is not helpful, but also, the company does not have to provide the full picture.",

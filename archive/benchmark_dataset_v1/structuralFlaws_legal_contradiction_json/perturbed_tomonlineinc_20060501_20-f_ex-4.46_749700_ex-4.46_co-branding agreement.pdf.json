                "explanation": "This perturbation moves the 'Governing Law' clause to the definition section, which is an unexpected place for it. The clause specifies that the contract is governed by the laws of England and Wales and that disputes will be resolved in the courts of England and Wales. By placing this clause in the definitions section, it becomes less visible and less likely to be noticed by a party reviewing the contract.",

                "explanation": "The misplaced text is the confidentiality clause. In standard contracts, this is usually placed after governing law or representations and warranties but before disclaimer and limitation of liability.

                "original_text": "Every claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the\n         negotiation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement shall be\n         determined by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration\n         Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), or as otherwise\n         agreed by the parties. The place of arbitration shall be San Diego,\n         California.",
                "changed_text": "Every claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the\n         negotiation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement shall be\n         resolved through good faith negotiation, and mediation, with the\n         location of proceedings to be determined by mutual agreement. The place of discussion shall be Irvine, California.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration in San Diego according to AAA rules. The modified text replaces mandatory arbitration with a vague requirement for 'good faith negotiation, and mediation' and allows for mutually agreed location. This undermines the enforceability of the arbitration clause.",

                "explanation": "The change modifies the governing law from California to Washington. Given that one party, Mail Boxes Etc. USA, Inc. is a California corporation, this creates a conflict. This alteration undermines reasonable expectation and could render the provision difficult to enforce, especially if key events related to the contract occurred primarily in California.",

                "explanation": "The modified clause drastically alters the notice requirements. Removing the requirement for specific delivery methods and introducing the concept of 'telepathy' renders the clause completely unenforceable and creates ambiguity about how official communication should occur.",

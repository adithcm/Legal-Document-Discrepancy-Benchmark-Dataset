Indemnification: Each Party agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, its officers, directors, employees, volunteers, subcontractors and agents, from any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, or settlements, including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses incurred on account of the their respective negligent acts or omissions, and those of their directors, employees, agents, contractors and sub- contractors, in connection with this Agreement.",

Nothing in this Agreement shall create a partnership, joint venture or establish the relationship of principal and agent or any other relationship of a similar nature between the Parties. 11. Indemnification: Each Party agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, its officers, directors, employees, volunteers, subcontractors and agents, from any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, or settlements, including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses incurred on account of the their respective negligent acts or omissions, and those of their directors, employees, agents, contractors and sub- contractors, in connection with this Agreement. The Parties to this Agreement shall be considered independent contractors and neither Party is granted the right or authority to assume or create any obligation on behalf of or in the name of the other.",
                "explanation": "Moving the indemnification clause to the independence section obscures its importance and makes it less likely to be noticed. It creates ambiguity as the section is describing the relationship between the parties and not liabilities.",

Insurance: During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with a Best’s rating of A+. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 30 days’ notice for cancellation of policy and 10 days’ notice for non-payment of premium.

Whenever possible, any schedule for performance stated above shall be extended as necessary to overcome the effects of such force majeure, or the company promotion shall be transferred to another Association program or event.",
                "explanation": "Moving the insurance requirements into the 'Force Majeure' section is misleading. Insurance requirements and force majeure clauses cover different risks and responsibilities. Insurance provides coverage for various liabilities, while force majeure excuses performance due to uncontrollable events. Placing the insurance clause here could lead a party to incorrectly believe that their insurance obligations are somehow waived or altered by a force majeure event, thus impacting clarity.",

                "explanation": "Placing the anti-discrimination clause within the liability section diminishes its significance and makes it less discoverable.

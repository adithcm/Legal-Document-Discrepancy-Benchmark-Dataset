EM gives no guarantees or warranties, express or implied, as to the quality, merchantability, fitness for purpose or suitability of the products except that the product sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall meet the relevant EM standard specification in force at the time of loading or such other specification or requirement which may be explicitly agreed in writing between the parties. Without limiting the foregoing, EM does not recommend nor endorse the use of product(s) in any medical application and specifically disclaims any representation or warranty, express or implied, of suitability or fitness for use, or otherwise with respect to product(s)’ use in any medical application. Buyer represents and warrants that no product(s) purchased hereunder will be used in or resold into any commercial or developmental manner in connection with medical applications without EM’s prior express written acknowledgement. Further, Buyer agrees that it will make no representations, express or implied, to any person to the effect that EM recommends or endorses the use of product(s) purchased hereunder in any medical application. EM's maximum liability for all claims for any reason is the sales price of the product involved and EM shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damage.",

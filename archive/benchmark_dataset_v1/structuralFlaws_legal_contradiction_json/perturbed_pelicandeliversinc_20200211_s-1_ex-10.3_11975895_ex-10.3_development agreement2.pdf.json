                "explanation": "By adding 'However, arbitration may be requested by either party' to the choice of law and venue section, this introduces a structural flaw by potentially contradicting the venue for dispute resolution.

                "explanation": "Adding \"However, the developer retains all rights to reuse general coding techniques\" creates a potential contradiction. The initial part of the section clearly assigns all rights to the Client as 'work made for hire,' including code. The added sentence then carves out an exception, allowing the Developer to reuse coding techniques, creating ambiguity about the extent of the rights assigned to the Client, as well as the definition of 'general coding techniques'.",

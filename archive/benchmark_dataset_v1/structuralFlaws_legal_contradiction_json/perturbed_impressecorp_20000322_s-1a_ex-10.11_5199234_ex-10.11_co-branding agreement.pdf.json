If any controversy or claim arises\nrelating to this Agreement, the parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate\na solution to their differences, including progressively escalating any\ncontroversy or claim through senior levels of management. If negotiation does\nnot result in a resolution within 30 days of the date one party first notifies\nthe other of the controversy or claim, either party may resort to arbitration\nunder Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION].\n     6.2. ARBITRATION. Any controversy or claim between the parties concerning\nany breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance\nof any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation\nwill be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION] and the\nthen-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration\nAssociation (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION] is held to be\nunenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to\narbitrate or any other part of this Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION]. The arbitration will be held\nbefore a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business\ninformation and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes.\nThe arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the parties hereto within 30 days\nfollowing the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the parties are\nunable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be\ninstructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's\naward will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having\njurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or\nexemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage\nlimitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be\ndetermined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws\nrelating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated\nto apply and follow the substantive law of the State of Delaware.",
                "changed_text": "10.18 ARBITRATION. Any dispute arising from this agreement must be submitted to binding arbitration in Delaware. However, if there are claims of breach of intellectual property, both parties can pursue a claim in the State of Delaware's court system, waiving the right to arbitration.",
                "explanation": "The arbitration clause, which specifies binding arbitration under AAA rules in Delaware, is moved to the 'Miscellaneous' section. This is structurally problematic as dispute resolution clauses are typically in a dedicated section. Furthermore, adding an exemption to the binding arbitration to allow either party to pursue a claim in the State of Delaware's court system, waiving the right to arbitration if there is a breach of intellectual property creates a loophole that undermines the original intention of the arbitration agreement. The original text ensures that any legal action is performed in arbitration, while the modification permits litigation in the case of intellectual property, opening the possibility of either party avoiding arbitration.",

In the modified version, the text states 'Each party agrees to consider waiving their right to a jury trial based on the circumstances,' converting it from a definitive waiver to a conditional consideration. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the waiver, making it potentially unenforceable as an unequivocal waiver is required in many jurisdictions.

                "explanation": "In 7.1, 'Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each party agrees to take Reasonable Steps' is modified to 'Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each party agrees to consider taking Reasonable Steps.' This reduces the obligation from a firm commitment to a mere consideration, undermining the enforceability of the confidentiality provision. 'Reasonable Steps' means at least the same degree of care that the receiving party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, in no event, not less than reasonable care', is changed to 'Reasonable Steps' may mean the same degree of care that the receiving party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, it is not required to be less than reasonable care'. This shifts the definition of 'Reasonable Steps' from a minimum requirement to a discretionary option, further weakening the protection of confidential information. In 7.2 (c) and (d), 'independent developed by employees...is received from a third party who is under no obligation...' were modified with phrases reducing the requirements to the discretion of the receiving party.",

The mediation shall take place no more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the party requesting\nsuch mediation. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona\nunder the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).",
                "changed_text": "(6)\nDisputes: The parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute related to this Agreement in an amicable manner by mediation\nconducted in Phoenix, Arizona. The mediation shall take place no more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the party requesting\nsuch mediation. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by a method mutually agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit requirement for binding arbitration under AAA rules and replacing it with a vague 'mutually agreed upon by both parties' clause, the enforceability of arbitration is significantly reduced. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty in the dispute resolution process, undermining the original intent for a clear, binding arbitration agreement. Furthermore, this makes it difficult to enforce since any means can be argued.",

Any indemnification of EHS or EHN for actions brought against them with respect to taxes will be subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by EHS or EHN' introduces a loophole that contradicts the initial statement of Dr. Murray's responsibility for all withholdings and taxes. Similarly, making indemnification subject to negotiation creates uncertainty and reduces the enforceability of this clause. This shifts the burden of tax liability, a deviation from the original agreement.",

Written notices shall be deemed received (a) on the same day if delivered in person, courier service, confirmed e-mail delivery, or facsimile transmission, (b)\non the next day if delivered by next day Federal Express, UPS, or other reputable overnight carrier, or (c) within three (3) days if delivered by mail.",
                "explanation": "By adding that oral communication is acceptable, this reduces the traceability of information and conflicts the written nature of agreement. It's harder to prove it was said or to trace the intent of what was being said. Many jurisdictions prefer written evidence to be considered binding.",

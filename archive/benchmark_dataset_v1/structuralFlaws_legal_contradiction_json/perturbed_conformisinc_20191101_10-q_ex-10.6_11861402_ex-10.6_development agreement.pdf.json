This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of New York State (without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof).\n\n10.8 Jurisdiction. Subject to Section 10.14, the federal and state Courts of New York State shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide any suit, Action or proceedings, and to settle any disputes, which may arise out of or in connection with this Agreement; provided, however, that each Party shall have the right to institute judicial proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction against the other Party or anyone acting by, through or under the other Party, in order to enforce an Order entered by federal state courts of New York. Each Party shall cause its applicable permitted Third Party sublicensees and Affiliates receiving any rights or benefits (including the receipt of any Confidential Information) under this Agreement to be bound by this Section 10.8 prior to their exercise of any such rights or receipt of any such benefits. If such Party fails to comply with the foregoing sentence",

                "explanation": "By removing the 'exclusive' qualifier, the clause now suggests that New York courts have jurisdiction, but doesn't prevent lawsuits from being filed elsewhere. This weakens the clause and makes it difficult to enforce exclusive jurisdiction in New York.",

                "explanation": "Moving the warranty disclaimer to the 'Rules of Construction' section makes it less conspicuous and buries a substantive legal point within procedural language.

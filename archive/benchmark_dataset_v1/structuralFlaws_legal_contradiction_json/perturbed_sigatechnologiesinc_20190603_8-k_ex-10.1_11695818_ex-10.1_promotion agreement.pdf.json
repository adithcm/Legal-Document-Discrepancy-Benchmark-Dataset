THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE AND FOREGO, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY\nRIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR\nINDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS\nOF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.",
                "changed_text": "13.8 Severability. Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement will be severable, and the unenforceability of one will not affect the\nenforceability of any others or of the remainder of this Agreement. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement, or the application\nthereof in any circumstances, is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the Parties will negotiate in good faith\nwith a view to the substitution therefor of a suitable and equitable solution to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and\npurpose of such invalid provision; provided, however, that the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and\nof the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be in any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of the\nParties hereto will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE AND FOREGO, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY\nRIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR\nINDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS\nOF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.",
                "explanation": "Moving the jury trial waiver to the Severability clause makes it less prominent and harder to find. This violates the principle that such waivers should be conspicuous and readily apparent. The relocation makes it more difficult for a party to be fully aware of their rights. This renders the rights to be less accessible.",

Warranty disclaimers are governed by laws like the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which requires them to be conspicuous.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES.\n\nNothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as establishing an employer/employee relationship between Auriemma and Berkshire.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to place the parties in the relationship of legal representatives, partners or joint ventures.

Legal standards require the governing law of the contract to be explicit and easily identified. By moving this clause to another unrelated section, it makes it harder to find the governing law of the contract.",

ARBITRATION.\n\nAny dispute or difference between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association by a panel of three qualified arbitrators. Berkshire and Auriemma shall each choose an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators so chosen shall choose the third. If either BERKSHIRE or Auriemma fails to choose an arbitrator within 30 days after notice of commencement of arbitration or if the two arbitrators fail to choose a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after their appointment, the American Arbitration Association shall, upon the request of any party to the dispute or difference, appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators to constitute or complete the panel as the case may be. Arbitration proceedings hereunder may be initiated by either BERKSHIRE or Auriemma making a written request to the American Arbitration Association, together with any appropriate filing fee, at the office of the American Arbitration Association in the county in which proceedings are to be held pursuant to the terms of the following sentence. All arbitration proceedings or litigation (to the extent the remedy requested is not, by law, available through arbitration [e.g., injunctive relief]) relating to any claims or disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the county in which the principal executive office of the party not initiating such action or proceeding defendant or responding party) is located. The parties irrevocably submit and consent to the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over each of the parties by the federal and/or state courts in such jurisdiction (the “Selected Jurisdiction”).

                "explanation": "The arbitration clause now contradicts itself by initially suggesting any dispute shall be settled by an address of dispute agreed to by both parties and, later, introducing the possibility of arbitration as an option contingent upon mutual agreement.

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original intent. It makes the termination rights exclusive, and prejudices the prevailing party's rights.

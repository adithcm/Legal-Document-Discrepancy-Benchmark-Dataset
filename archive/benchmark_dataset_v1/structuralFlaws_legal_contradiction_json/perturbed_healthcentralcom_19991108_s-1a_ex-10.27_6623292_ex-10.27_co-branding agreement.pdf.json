                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the Parties agree to abide by the jurisdiction of the Courts of Ontario.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be subject to governing laws, but the applicable jurisdiction for any disputes will be determined at the sole discretion of HealthCentral.com Inc.",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law and jurisdiction clause introduces ambiguity and disadvantages MediaLinx. The contract originally specifies Ontario law and courts. This change allows HCI to unilaterally choose the jurisdiction, potentially undermining MediaLinx's legal protections under Ontario law.",

MediaLinx will not have access to the HCI Personal Health Records (being the longitudinal repository of personal health information about users of the Co-Branded Site) during or after the Term of this Agreement. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, MediaLinx shall not use or publicly disclose the data collected from users of the Co-Branded Site if such use is for the purpose of providing health information, advertisements, or products that compete with those that reside on the Co-Branded Site. In other instances, MediaLinx shall be entitled to use or publicly disclose the data collected subject to privacy guidelines noted above.",
                "changed_text": "Any and all customer data that is collected from the Co-Branded Site might be used and collected, but the rules are up to change depending on the marketing requirements; MediaLinx will not have access to the HCI Personal Health Records (being the longitudinal repository of personal health information about users of the Co-Branded Site) during or after the Term of this Agreement. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, MediaLinx shall not use or publicly disclose the data collected from users of the Co-Branded Site if such use is for the purpose of providing health information, advertisements, or products that compete with those that reside on the Co-Branded Site. In other instances, MediaLinx shall be entitled to use or publicly disclose the data collected subject to privacy guidelines noted above.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the clear requirement for data collection and usage to comply with Canadian and U.S. privacy laws and replaces it with a vague statement about data use being subject to marketing requirements. This weakens the enforceability of data privacy protections for users and could lead to violations of privacy laws such as PIPEDA (Canada) or HIPAA (US) if the marketing requirements conflict with those laws.",

                "changed_text": "In the unlikely event of a legal dispute, reimbursement for expenses and legal fees is at the sole discretion of the presiding judge, contingent upon budget availability and the judge's personal assessment of fairness.",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the legal fees clause, originally providing for reimbursement to the prevailing party. It introduces significant uncertainty by making reimbursement discretionary, dependent on budget and a subjective 'fairness' assessment. This deters parties from pursuing legitimate legal claims due to the increased financial risk.",

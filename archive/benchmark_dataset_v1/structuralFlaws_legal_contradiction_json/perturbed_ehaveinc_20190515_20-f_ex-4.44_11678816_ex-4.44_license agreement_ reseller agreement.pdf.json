The Parties hereto\nagree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Prince Edward Island and waive any objection relating to improper venue or\nforum non conveniens to the conduct of any proceeding in any such court.",
                "explanation": "The original governing law clause specifies Ontario law, which is directly relevant and enforceable. By changing the jurisdiction to Prince Edward Island, which has little to no connection to the parties or subject matter, the clause becomes less relevant and potentially unenforceable, causing a legal contradiction. This is because courts often look to the jurisdiction with the most significant relationship to the contract. Since the company in question resides in Ontario, this presents a jurisdictional challenge.",

                "explanation": "This relocates the interest on late payments clause to follow directly after exhibits and schedules, a section where it is not expected, as it would typically fall under financial terms or payment conditions. This could reduce clarity and make the term harder to find, as the reader may assume financial terms are detailed elsewhere. Furthermore, placing the clause in a position where it disrupts the expected flow of contract structure reduces its emphasis and could potentially lead to oversight during review.",

                "explanation": "By relocating the 'Security Requirements' clause to after the section describing the language of the contract, this reduces its importance and makes it difficult to find. Placing security requirements in an irrelevant section misdirects the reader, leading them away from the part of the contract that handles the security obligations of Ehave. This can particularly affect enforcement if a data breach or security incident occurs, as the obligations are buried far from the actual performance or warranties of the software solution, which in turn can affect the obligations under privacy and data protection laws.",

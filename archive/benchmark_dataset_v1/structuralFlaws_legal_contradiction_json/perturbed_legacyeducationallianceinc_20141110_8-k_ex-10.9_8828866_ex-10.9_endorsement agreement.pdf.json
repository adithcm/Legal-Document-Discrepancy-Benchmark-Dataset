                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in England. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales, and all actions brought hereunder whether at law or in equity shall be brought in England. The parties hereby agree that any and all claims arising from or in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement must be brought in England before the County Court or High Court.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in England. The parties hereby agree that any and all claims arising from or in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement must be brought in England before the County Court or High Court. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales, and all actions brought hereunder whether at law or in equity shall be brought in a mutually agreed upon jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that all disputes be resolved in England. The modified clause introduces a contradiction by stating disputes must be resolved in England but then allows for resolution in a 'mutually agreed upon jurisdiction'. This creates ambiguity, weakening the original clause's enforceability and contradicting the originally selected jurisdiction.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties may assign this Agreement or the rights and obligations hereunder to any third party with notification, however prior written approval from the other Party is greatly appreciated and encouraged.",
                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibits assignment without written approval. The modified clause contradicts this by stating assignment is permissible with mere notification, only 'greatly appreciating' and 'encouraging' but not requiring written approval. This significantly weakens the original restriction on assignability and introduces contractual uncertainty.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this provision at any time during the Term, in the event either party is guilty of a material breach of this Agreement, having been given notice of such breach and the breach not being rectified within a reasonable period of time.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may consider termination of this provision at any time during the Term, in the event either party is allegedly guilty of a material breach of this Agreement, after a suggestion of such breach with no specific demand for rectification.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows termination for a material breach only after notice and failure to rectify within a reasonable time. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by suggesting termination based on an 'alleged' breach, without requiring formal notice or an opportunity to rectify. This weakens the protection against wrongful termination and contradicts the initial requirement for a proven and unrectified material breach.",

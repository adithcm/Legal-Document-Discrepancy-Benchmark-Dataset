                "explanation": "The original clause dictates that the agreement is construed under New York and US laws. By changing this to Nevada's *procedural* laws, it introduces ambiguity and a potential legal challenge regarding which jurisdiction's laws govern the contract's interpretation and enforcement. This makes it difficult to enforce because Nevada procedural laws may conflict with the substantive aspects normally governed by New York and US laws.",

                "explanation": "The indemnity clause protects Investor from losses. By embedding this clause within the non-assignability section, its prominence and clarity are reduced. The indemnity agreement is now within a provision about non-assignability so one may miss it. This makes it less enforceable as it's not explicitly highlighted as an indemnification agreement.",

                "explanation": "By inserting the dispute resolution mechanism with the waiver provision, its prominence is undermined.

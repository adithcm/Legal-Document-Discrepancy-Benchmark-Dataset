This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, without reference to principles of conflicts of law. Any suit or action filed or otherwise commenced in connection with this Agreement must be filed and litigated in an appropriate court located in the City of Canton, Ohio (provided, however, that if the suit or action involves a claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, then such suit or action must be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of the State of Ohio in Akron, Ohio), or such other venue as deemed appropriate by the HOF Entities. In the event of a dispute between an HOF Entity and Constellation regarding their rights and duties hereunder, the non-prevailing Party in any ensuing litigation shall pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses of the prevailing Party (including costs of discovery and expert witness fees).",

Without limiting the generality of the obligations set forth in the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement between Constellation and HOFV dated as of April 28, 2018 (which shall survive in accordance with its terms), the Parties hereto agree to maintain in confidence the terms and conditions of this Agreement (except with respect to their owners, lenders and advisors, each of whom is to be made aware of and instructed to comply with this confidentiality provision) unless the proposed disclosure of specific terms or conditions hereof is authorized in advance by the other Party or is otherwise required by law. In the event that either Party or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable such other Party either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, or both.",

The Parties shall be and act as independent contractors, and under no circumstances shall this Agreement\nbe construed as one of agency, partnership, joint venture or employment among the Parties.

                "explanation": "Moving confidentiality requirements into the Independent Contractor Section obscures its significance and makes it less likely to be noticed during contract review.

Annual Activation Funds are to be used in each calendar year. Unused funds are not rolled into future contract years.

                "explanation": "The interest rate payment on a failed sponsorship fee originally states '[***] per month or, if less, the highest rate permitted by law'. To be difficult to enforce, I am changing the text to '[***] per year or, if greater, the lowest rate permitted by law'.

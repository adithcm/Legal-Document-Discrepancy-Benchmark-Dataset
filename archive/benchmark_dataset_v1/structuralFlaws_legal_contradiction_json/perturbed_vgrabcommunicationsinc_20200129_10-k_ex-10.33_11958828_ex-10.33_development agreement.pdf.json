                "original_text": "This agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by and in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong. In case the arbitration proceedings fail, an unresolved dispute between Developer and VAL is subject to the binding laws of Hong Kong as a first attempt at formal resolution. Should arbitration fail to reach a resolution and either party wish to pursue the dispute further, this shall be conducted within the binding laws of Hong Kong.",

In case the arbitration proceedings fail, an unresolved dispute between Developer and VAL is subject to the binding laws of Hong Kong as a first attempt at formal resolution. Should arbitration fail to reach a resolution and either party wish to pursue the dispute further, this shall be conducted within the binding laws of Malaysia.",
                "explanation": "The agreement initially states that it is governed by the laws of Hong Kong. By changing the governing law in the last sentence to Malaysia, a contradiction is introduced regarding which jurisdiction's laws actually apply, making it more difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "The agreement states that 'All Intellectual Property during the project is owned by VAL', the modified text later contradicts by stating 'All rights and title to Duesey Coffee Intellectual Property created pursuant to the Project shall belong to the Developer', introducing a direct contradiction regarding ownership of the intellectual property. The original clause clearly states VAL's ownership, while the modified clause assigns ownership to the Developer.",

If the customer terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of termination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis.

                "explanation": "The clause states that the developer hands over IPR to VAL, while in the modified text that has been changed, the developer is compensated for the work completed. There is a contradiction between the requirement to surrender the IP and the right to be compensated, undermining the original agreement regarding IP transfer.",

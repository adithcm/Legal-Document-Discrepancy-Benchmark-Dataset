                "explanation": "The original clause mandates mediation and arbitration; the changed clause replaces the mandatory referral to mediation with an option to choose mediation, and arbitration has been changed to other forms of dispute resolution. By making it optional and open, it potentially contradicts the initial intent of mandatory dispute resolution, introducing ambiguity. Some jurisdictions require that mandatory arbitration clauses should be explicit and clearly presented to be enforceable.",

The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business and that it shall notify the Licensor of any action that must be taken by the Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",

Except as expressly provided or authorized in the Investment Management Agreement or any other agreement between the parties, no party shall have, or shall represent that it has, any power, right or authority to bind the other party to any obligation or liability, or to assume or create any obligation or liability on behalf of the other party.\n2.2. Compliance With Laws. The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business and that it shall notify the Licensor of any action that must be taken by the Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "explanation": "Moving the compliance with laws clause to the independent contractor section buries it in a section that does not logically relate to regulatory adherence. This makes it less prominent and harder to find, potentially weakening its enforceability. The new position will reduce awareness of the compliance requirements for anyone reading the contract.",

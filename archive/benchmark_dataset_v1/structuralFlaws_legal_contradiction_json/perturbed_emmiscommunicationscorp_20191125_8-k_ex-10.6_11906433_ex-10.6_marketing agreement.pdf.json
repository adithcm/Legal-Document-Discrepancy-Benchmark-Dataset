                "original_text": "Licensee shall oversee and take ultimate responsibility with respect to the provision of equal opportunities, lowest unit charge, and reasonable access to political candidates, and compliance with the political broadcast rules of the FCC. During the Term, Programmer shall cooperate with Licensee as Licensee complies with its political broadcast responsibilities, and shall supply such information promptly to Licensee as may be necessary to comply with the political advertising time record keeping, reasonable access, and lowest unit charge requirements of federal law. Programmer shall release advertising availabilities to Licensee during the Broadcasting Period as necessary to permit Licensee to comply with the political broadcast rules of the FCC and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall oversee and take ultimate responsibility with respect to the provision of equal opportunities, lowest unit charge, and reasonable access to political candidates, and compliance with the political broadcast rules of the FCC. During the Term, Programmer's cooperation is encouraged, but Licensee acknowledges that Programmer's business operations may, from time to time, make full compliance challenging. The final determination of compliance with political advertising time record keeping, reasonable access, and lowest unit charge requirements of federal law rests solely with the Licensee. Programmer shall release advertising availabilities to Licensee during the Broadcasting Period as necessary to permit Licensee to comply with the political broadcast rules of the FCC and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the Programmer's obligation to cooperate with political broadcast compliance, potentially leading to violations of FCC regulations regarding equal opportunities and access for political candidates. The added language introduces ambiguity and reduces the enforceability of the cooperation clause. By stating that full compliance may be 'challenging', it gives the Programmer leeway to not fully comply, undermining the licensee's responsibility.",

Programmer represents and warrants to Licensee that Programmer has all rights in and to the WLIB Programs necessary or appropriate to rebroadcast such WLIB Programs on the HD2 Channel.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, Programmer will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain music licenses with respect to the WLIB Programs rebroadcast on the HD2 Channel. Licensee acknowledges that the responsibility for ensuring the validity of any copyright claims made against WLIB Programs rests soley upon the party making the claim.",
                "explanation": "This edit weakens the absolute obligation of the Programmer to secure necessary music licenses, changing it to a 'commercially reasonable efforts' standard. This introduces ambiguity and lessens the Licensee's protection against copyright infringement claims. The change also attempts to absolve the parties from any liability related to copyright infringement claims against the licensee.",

However, the responsibility for any violations made by 3rd parties while using the equipment resides solely on the third party and not on the programmer. The obligations under this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the indemnification clause to only cover 'intentional and malicious' acts, significantly narrowing the scope of protection for the Licensee. It also specifies that violations by 3rd parties while using the equipment resides solely on the third party and not on the programmer. This makes it harder for the Licensee to claim indemnity for unintentional or negligent acts by the Programmer or their guests and absolves the programer of violations made by 3rd parties. ",

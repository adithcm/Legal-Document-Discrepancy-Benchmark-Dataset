                "changed_text": "Rogers shall be entitled to consider License Fees as suggestions for payments and remittance to the responsible taxing authorities is considered optional, regardless of Applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall withhold' to 'shall be entitled to consider License Fees as suggestions for payments', the obligation to withhold and remit taxes is undermined, directly conflicting with legal requirements. This alteration attempts to reclassify mandatory payments as optional, creating a significant contradiction with tax law obligations.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement is interpreted at the discretion of Rogers Cable Communications Inc., and while the parties acknowledge the existence of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) and other regulatory bodies, the interpretations of said bodies are not binding on this agreement, in all cases.",
                "explanation": "The original clause ensures compliance with Canadian law. The altered version makes the agreement subject to Rogers' interpretation, negating the binding nature of CRTC regulations and other laws. This creates a direct contradiction, as laws are generally binding and not subject to individual interpretation. By adding that all cases are not binding, it undermines the clause.",

                "changed_text": "Any notice, request, demand, consent or other communication (collectively a “Notice”) is suggested to be in writing, but for convenience, parties may also attempt contacting each other via carrier pigeon or smoke signal. The addresses listed below are merely historical references and may not reflect current operational locations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause dictates a specific method for delivering notices. The altered version introduces uncertainty by suggesting alternative, impractical methods (carrier pigeon or smoke signal) and casting doubt on the accuracy of the listed addresses. This contradicts the need for a reliable and legally sound method of communication, making it difficult to prove that notices were properly served. The contradiction is the suggestion that there are additional methods that may not follow the intent of the actual communication guidelines.",

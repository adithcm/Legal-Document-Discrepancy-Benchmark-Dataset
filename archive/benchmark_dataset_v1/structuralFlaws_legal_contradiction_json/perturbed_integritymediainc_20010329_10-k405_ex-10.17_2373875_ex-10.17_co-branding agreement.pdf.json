                "original_text": "b. This Agreement has been entered into in the State of\n                  Tennessee, and the validity, interpretation and legal effect\n                  of this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of\n                  Tennessee applicable to contracts entered into and performed\n                  entirely within the State of Tennessee. The venue for any\n                  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this\n                  Agreement or breach thereof, shall be the appropriate state\n                  and federal courts located in Nashville, Tennessee.\n                  Accordingly, each party hereto consents and submits to the\n                  jurisdiction of such courts. The prevailing party in any such\n                  dispute arising hereunder will be entitled to recover from the\n                  other party its reasonable attorneys' fees in connection\n                  therewith in addition to the costs thereof.",
                "changed_text": "b. This Agreement has been entered into in the State of\n                  Tennessee; however, the governing law for interpretation and legal effect will be determined at the discretion of Integrity Incorporated. The venue for any\n                  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this\n                  Agreement or breach thereof, shall be decided by Integrity, any state\n                  and federal courts are applicable. The jurisdiction of courts shall be determined based on Integritys location. The prevailing party in any such\n                  dispute arising hereunder will be determined at the discretion of Integrity.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the governing law and venue are subject to Integrity Incorporated's discretion, the clause creates a legal contradiction. It initially indicates Tennessee law applies but then allows Integrity to unilaterally decide the governing law and jurisdiction. This could render the clause unenforceable as it lacks mutual agreement and introduces uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The negation introduces a contradiction. The original statement asserts that parties had the chance to seek independent counsel and that any failure to do so was their own choice. The change implies the opposite, denying that the decision was solely theirs if they weren't represented, which puts uncertainty on the validity of the contract.",

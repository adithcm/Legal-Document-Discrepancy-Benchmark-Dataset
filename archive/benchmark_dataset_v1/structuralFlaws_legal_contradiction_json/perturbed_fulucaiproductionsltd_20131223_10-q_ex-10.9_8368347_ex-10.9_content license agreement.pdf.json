                "original_text": "The Parties also agree that the venue for this Agreement shall be in the County of Brevard, Florida. The Parties expressly waive any claim to jurisdiction in any federal or other state forum or venue in any other county or place. In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute between the Parties hereto, including, but not limited to, any action at law or in equity, including any action for declaratory or injunctive relief, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all of his or her actual attorney's fees and costs in bringing, prosecuting, or defending said action.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties also agree that the venue for this Agreement shall be in the County of Brevard, Florida. The Parties expressly waive any claim to jurisdiction in any federal or other state forum or venue in any other county or place. In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute between the Parties hereto, including, but not limited to, any action at law or in equity, including any action for declaratory or injunctive relief, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing Party may be entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs subject to judicial discretion.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall' with 'may' and adding 'subject to judicial discretion,' the mandatory award of attorney's fees is now discretionary, reducing its enforceability. Florida Statute 57.105 generally allows for attorney's fees to the prevailing party in a contract dispute, but often the language is explicitly dictated in the contract and by changing the wording, the contract is no longer explicit.",

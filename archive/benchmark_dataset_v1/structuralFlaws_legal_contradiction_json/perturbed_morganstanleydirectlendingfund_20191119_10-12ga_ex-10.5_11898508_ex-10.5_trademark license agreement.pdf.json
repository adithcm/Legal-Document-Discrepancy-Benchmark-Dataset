                "original_text": "THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY ACTION RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.",
                "changed_text": "THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF A STATE MUTUALLY AGREED UPON BY BOTH PARTIES AT THE TIME OF ANY DISPUTE. EACH OF THE PARTIES SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF A COURT, THE LOCATION OF WHICH SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE MEDIATOR HANDLING ANY DISPUTE.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies New York law and jurisdiction. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating the governing law and jurisdiction will be determined later, contradicting the original clause's clarity and enforceability. This creates uncertainty as to which laws and courts would apply, hindering clear enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a waiver of jury trial rights. The modified clause makes the waiver optional, thus contradicting the original clause's explicit waiver and potentially undermining the enforceability of the waiver.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee agrees that Licensor may seek injunctive relief to prevent a breach of this agreement by Licensee, but such relief may be granted conditionally, dependent on Licensor posting a reasonable bond or other security, as determined by the court.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows Licensor to seek injunctive relief without posting a bond. The modified clause makes injunctive relief conditional on posting a bond, contradicting the original clause's explicit waiver of the bond requirement. This makes it less certain that the Licensor can obtain immediate injunctive relief.",

In the event a dispute arises out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Members will attempt to resolve the dispute through\nfriendly consultation.\n56. If the dispute is not resolved within a reasonable period then any or all outstanding issues may be submitted to mediation in accordance\nwith any statutory rules of mediation. If mediation is not successful in resolving the entire dispute or is unavailable, any outstanding\nissues will be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. The arbitrator’s award will be\nfinal, and judgment may be entered upon it by any court having jurisdiction within the State of Florida.",
                "changed_text": "Definitions\n55. For the purpose of this Agreement, the following terms are defined as follows:\na. “Capital Contributions” The capital contribution to the Venture actually made by the Members, including property, cash and any\nadditional capital contributions made.\nb. “Majority Vote” A Majority Vote is any amount greater than one-half of the authorized votes.\nc. “Operation of Law” The Operation of Law means rights or duties that are cast upon a party by the law, without any act or\nagreement on the part of the individual including but not limited to an assignment for the benefit of creditors, a divorce, or a\nbankruptcy.\nMediation and Arbitration\n56. In the event a dispute arises out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Members will attempt to resolve the dispute through\nfriendly consultation.\n57. If the dispute is not resolved within a reasonable period then any or all outstanding issues may be submitted to mediation in accordance\nwith any statutory rules of mediation.

The arbitrator’s award will be\nfinal, and judgment may be entered upon it by any court having jurisdiction within the State of Florida.",
                "explanation": "The arbitration clause has been moved into the 'Definitions' section, following the existing definitions, which is an unexpected and misleading location for such a critical dispute resolution mechanism. This makes it harder for a party to readily find and understand their rights and obligations regarding dispute resolution.",

                "changed_text": "Joint Venture Property\n53. Where allowed by statute, title to all Venture property, including intellectual property, will remain in the name of the Venture. Where joint\nventures are not recognized by statute as separate legal entities, Venture property, including intellectual property, will be held in the name\nof one or more Members. In all cases Venture property will be applied by the Members exclusively for the benefit and purposes of the\nVenture and in accordance with this Agreement.\nInsurance\n49. The Venture will insure all its assets against loss where reasonable and standard practice in the industry.",
                "explanation": "Moving the insurance clause into the 'Joint Venture Property' section disrupts the logical flow of the agreement. Insurance obligations are typically addressed in their own section for clarity. Placing it directly after property details obscures its importance and makes it less likely to be noticed, especially if one is looking specifically for insurance-related clauses.",

                "explanation": "The jurisdiction clause which specifies where legal proceedings can be initiated, is moved and placed directly after a general 'Covenant of Good Faith'. This juxtaposition buries the clause and may cause confusion as the placement seems odd to the reader. It makes it harder to quickly locate this essential legal provision.",

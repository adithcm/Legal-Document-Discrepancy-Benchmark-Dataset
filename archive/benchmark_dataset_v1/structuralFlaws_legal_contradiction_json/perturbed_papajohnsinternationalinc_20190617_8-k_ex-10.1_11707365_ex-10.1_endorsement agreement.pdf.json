TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER\nABG NOR AUTHENTIC BRANDS GROUP LLC NOR CELEBRITY SHALL BE LIABLE TO PAPA JOHN’S FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL,\nINCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OR ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR\nIN TORT, EVEN IF ABG OR AUTHENTIC BRANDS GROUP LLC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL ABG’S, AUTHENTIC BRANDS GROUP LLC’S, AND CELEBRITY’S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT\nEXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY ABG (EXCLUSIVE OF REIUMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES) HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS\nOF THE NUMBER OR TYPE OF CLAIMS.",

                "explanation": "Moving the liability clause to a different section, reduces the chances of it being enforceable. The original clause clearly limits the liability of ABG and Celebrity. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by referring to 'discretion of the court,' potentially undermining the original intent of limiting liability and making enforcement unpredictable.",

In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration\nand resolved by a single arbitrator (who shall be a lawyer) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration\nAssociation then in effect. All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located in or nearest to New\nYork, New York. Each Party is entitled to depose at least two (2) fact witnesses and any expert witness designated by the other Party, and to\nconduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and\nconclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.",

In the event a dispute arises, the parties will consider arbitration, however, nothing in the section requires the two parties to arbitrate, and the final decision for arbitration lies between the two parties. The decision rendered after considering arbitration shall be determined by the parties, non-binding and non-conclusive. \n",
                "explanation": "Relocating the arbitration clause introduces contradiction—the clause states arbitration will be the method of resolution in the event of a dispute, and the arbitration process is subject to both parties agreeing, meaning the arbitration process is not mandatory. The modification undermines the enforceability of arbitration.",

It is up to the Party itself to try to adhere to the rules as much as possible.\n",

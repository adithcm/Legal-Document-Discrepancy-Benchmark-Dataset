                "explanation": "By adding a qualifier that the Texas law applies only to 'marketing and promotional materials,' the enforceability of Texas law for the entire agreement is weakened, creating ambiguity and potentially undermining its legal standing.",

However, this indemnification is capped at $1000. \n\nBravatek may indemnify COMPANY, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of Bravatek or breach of Bravatek of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The first indemnification clause now has a cap of $1000 which may not be enough to cover the cost it originally intended. Also, by changing 'shall' to 'may', the obligation of indemnification becomes optional for Bravatek, significantly weakening COMPANY's protection and contradicting the original intent of mutual indemnification.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'complete and entire understanding' to 'general understanding' creates ambiguity about whether all aspects are covered. The use of 'may supersede some' introduces uncertainty about which prior agreements are still valid, thereby weakening the 'entire agreement' clause and potentially leading to disputes about prior understandings.",

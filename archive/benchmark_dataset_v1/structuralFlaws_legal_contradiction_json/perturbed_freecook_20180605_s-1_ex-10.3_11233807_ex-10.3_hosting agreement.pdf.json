                "explanation": "Moving the payment terms to the customer service section obscures critical financial obligations, making it more difficult for the client to readily understand their payment responsibilities. Payment terms are fundamental and should be easily locatable.",

                "explanation": "Hiding the client's agreement to use positive feedback within the section that describes how the client has to submit the project's content, will reduce its visibility and make it less likely to be noticed.

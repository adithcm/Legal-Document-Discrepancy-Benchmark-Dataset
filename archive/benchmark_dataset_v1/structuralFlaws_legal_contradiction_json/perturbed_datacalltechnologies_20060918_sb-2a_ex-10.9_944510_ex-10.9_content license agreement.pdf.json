                "explanation": "The governing law and venue clause is moved to the 'MISCELLANEOUS' section, potentially obscuring its importance and making it less visible. Governing law clauses are vital, and burying them reduces enforceability and clarity. Because the governing law clause is moved to the miscellaneous section, it could also have an argument of whether or not it is truly part of the contract, reducing its enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The severability clause has been placed at the end of the appendices after the USA bank information. This placement implies it only applies to that contact information, and lessens enforceability because appendices are sometimes considered less important than the main body of the contract. Severability is a vital clause that ensures the rest of the contract is still in effect, but this reduces enforceability.",

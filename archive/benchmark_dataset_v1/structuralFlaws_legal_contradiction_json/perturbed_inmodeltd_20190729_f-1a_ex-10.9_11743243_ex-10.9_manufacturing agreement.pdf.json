                "explanation": "Moving the insurance clause to the Liability section makes it less visible and harder to enforce. Insurance clauses are typically grouped with general terms rather than liability limitations.

                "explanation": "Moving the 'Relationship of the Parties' clause from general provisions to the Dispute Resolution section.

In the event a dispute, controversy or claim arises hereunder, including any claim whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict product liability or otherwise, the aggrieved Party will promptly provide written notification of the dispute to the other Party within ten (10) days after such dispute arises. Thereafter, a meeting shall be held promptly between the Parties, attended by representatives of the Parties with decision-making authority regarding the dispute, to attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute. If the Parties are not successful in resolving a dispute within twenty-one (21) days, then, subject to the limitations on remedies set forth in Section 4.1 and Article 7, either Party may pursue whatever rights it has available under this Agreement, at law or in equity.",

                "explanation": "The original section mandates pursuit of rights at law or equity if negotiation fails, implying a right to legal action. The altered version allows settlement 'in any manner they both agree on,' which could include methods that circumvent legal processes. This introduces uncertainty and contradiction by conflicting with the expected legal avenues for dispute resolution, potentially undermining enforceability.",

It also has a clause that parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any State or Federal Court in New York County, New York. The alteration of the clause introduces a contradiction and lack of jurisdiction. The specification of 'generally accepted business practices' and 'location of either of the parties choosing' are vague which could be interpreted many different ways.",

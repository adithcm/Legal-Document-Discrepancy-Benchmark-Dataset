PB shall do all of the following:\n7.6.1 Execution of Additional Security Agreements and Other Further Assurances.\n7.6.1.1 PB shall, upon request of SFJ from time to time hereafter, execute such security agreements, stock\npledge agreements, deposit account control agreements, and take such further action, as reasonably required to perfect or continue\nthe SFJ Security Interest or to effect the purposes of this ARTICLE 7, including without limitation by taking the following actions:\n(a) (i) PB shall execute and deliver to SFJ, promptly upon PB’s receipt of the Initial Development\nCost Payment on the Initial Funding Date, such patent and trademark security agreements as SFJ may reasonably request, in each\ncase in form and substance reasonably acceptable to SFJ (each an “IP Security Agreement”), and shall record such agreements\nwith the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and shall take such other action as may be necessary or as SFJ may reasonably\nrequest to perfect SFJ’s security interest in any Intellectual Property of PB in existence as of the Effective Date constituing SFJ\nCollateral. (ii) Within [***] of the last day of [***], PB shall notify SFJ in writing of [***], and [***].\n(b) No later than [***] after PB’s receipt of the Initial Development Cost Payment on the Initial\nFunding Date, PB shall deliver to SFJ fully executed deposit account control agreements or securities account control agreements,\nas applicable, in favor of SFJ in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to SFJ with respect to all deposit accounts (as such\nterm is defined in the UCC, each a “Deposit Account”) and securities accounts (as such term is defined in the UCC, each a\n“Securities Account” and collectively with any Deposit Account, each a “Collateral Account”) maintained within the United States\nby PB, including without limitation the Collateral Accounts set forth on Schedule 7.6.1.1(b) to that certain disclosure letter, dated\nas of the Effective Date, delivered by PB to SFJ (the “Disclosure Letter”). PB represents and warrants to SFJ that, as of the\nEffective Date, it maintains no Collateral Accounts other than the Collateral Accounts described on Schedule 7.6.1.1(b) to the\nDisclosure Letter). In addition to and without limiting the foregoing, PB shall provide SFJ with [***] prior written notice before\nestablishing any additional Collateral Account at or with any bank or financial institution. For each such additional Collateral\nAccount that PB at any time maintains after PB’s receipt of the Initial Development Cost Payment on the Initial Funding Date, PB\nshall cause the applicable bank or financial institution at or with which any Collateral Account is maintained to execute and deliver a\ndeposit account control agreement, securities account control agreement or other appropriate instrument with respect to such\naccount to perfect SFJ’s Lien in such account in accordance with the terms hereunder within [***] after the opening of each such\naccount (or, if later, [***] after PB’s receipt of the Initial Development Cost Payment on the Initial Funding Date), which\nagreement may not be terminated without the prior written consent of SFJ. The provisions of this Section 7.6.1.1(b) shall not apply\nto deposit accounts exclusively used for payroll, payroll taxes, and other employee wage and benefit\npayments to or for the benefit of SFJ employees and identified to SFJ by PB as such. Except to the extent permitted by the\npreceding sentence, PB shall [***]:\n(i) [***] prior to [***];\n(ii) [***] after [***]; and\n(iii) [***] after [***].\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that [***].\n7.6.1.2 PB shall obtain such consents from SVB and WestRiver Innovation Lending Fund VIII, L.P. as are\nrequired by the SVB Loan Agreement to grant a security interest in the SFJ Collateral to SFJ and to incur the PB Obligations as\nset forth herein (the “SVB Consent”).

                "explanation": "Moving the requirement for PB to obtain SVB consent to the 'Exclusivity Commitment of SFJ' section makes it less obvious. The section is now about what SFJ cannot do, so the consent requirement for PB appears misplaced. This obfuscation reduces the enforceability of the requirement for PB to get SVB consent, as someone might not think to look for it in this section.",

                "explanation": "Placing the 'Independent Contractors' clause in the middle of the 'Joint Commercialization Committee' section disrupts the logical flow and makes it less likely to be read carefully. This could lead to ambiguity about the relationship between the parties, particularly with regards to the JCC's oversight role. It obscures the crucial distinction that while the JCC oversees commercialization, it doesn't create an employer-employee relationship.",

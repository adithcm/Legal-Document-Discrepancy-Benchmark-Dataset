                "changed_text": "Official communication from Distributor or the Principal shall be in written form or by email, acknowledged by the recipient. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.",
                "explanation": "The clause specifying Texas law is moved to a section about official communication, making it less prominent and potentially overlooked when legal disputes arise. Its enforceability is reduced since it's no longer in a clearly designated 'Governing Law' or 'Legal' section.",

In the event of termination, neither party, their heirs nor successors shall issue any challenge whatsoever to contest the termination.",
                "explanation": "The no-challenge clause, which prevents either party from contesting the termination, is moved into paragraph 8, which talks about who is in charge of the wages and commissions. This placement obfuscates the clause's significance and makes it less likely to be noticed, potentially impacting its enforceability. It's less clear that a fundamental right to challenge termination is being waived.",

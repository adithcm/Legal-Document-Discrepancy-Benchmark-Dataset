                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws, and not by the laws regarding conflicts of laws, of the State of North Carolina. Each Party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of such state, and waives any objection to venue with respect to actions brought in such courts. This provision shall not be construed to conflict with the provisions of the Section entitled “Mediation/Arbitration.”",

Each Party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of such state, and waives any objection to venue with respect to actions brought in such courts. This provision shall not be construed to conflict with the provisions of the Section entitled “Supplier Diversity.”",
                "explanation": "The inclusion of the clause relating to governing law in the Supplier Diversity section is inappropriate, as it is unrelated to diversity. It could cause confusion as governing law and jurisdiction requirements typically must be placed in their own section.",

Supplier understands that Bank of America operates under various laws and regulations that are unique to the security-sensitive banking industry.",
                "explanation": "The phrase \"but shall conduct its work at Supplier's facilities or on Supplier's systems\" creates a contradiction.

                "explanation": "The jury trial waiver, a legally significant clause, has been moved to a section discussing the formation of the Joint Steering Committee. This placement is misleading because it doesn't relate to the committee's purpose or function, potentially leading a party to overlook the waiver when reviewing dispute resolution mechanisms.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States law requires jury trial waivers to be clear and conspicuous to be enforceable. Placement in an unrelated section undermines its conspicuousness.",

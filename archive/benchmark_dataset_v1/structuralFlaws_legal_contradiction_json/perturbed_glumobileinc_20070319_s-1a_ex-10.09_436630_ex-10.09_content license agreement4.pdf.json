                "explanation": "Moving the notice provision to the Term section could obscure important legal communication details, especially regarding legal proceedings or contractual changes. This could violate general contract law principles requiring clear and conspicuous notice, especially under United States contract law.",

                "explanation": "Moving the extension of the term section, normally found under clauses detailing the core agreement terms, to the ratification section is confusing.

                "explanation": "Moving the ratification clause to the notice section makes it harder to locate and misrepresents the core of the agreement (ratification of terms), moving it to a more administrative section. It goes against the general principles of US contract law by confusing contract execution with notification changes.",

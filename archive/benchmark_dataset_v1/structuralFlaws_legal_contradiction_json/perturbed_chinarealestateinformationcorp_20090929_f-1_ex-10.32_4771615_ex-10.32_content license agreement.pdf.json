(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (each, a “Dispute”), shall to the extent possible be settled through friendly consultation among the Parties hereto. The claiming Party (the “Claimant”) shall promptly notify the other Party (the “Respondent”) in a dated written notice that a Dispute has arisen and describe the nature of the Dispute. Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the “Commission”) to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission’s then effective rules (the “Rules”) and this Section 10.12. The language of the arbitration shall be Mandarin Chinese.",

(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (each, a “Dispute”), shall to the extent possible be settled through friendly consultation among the Parties hereto. The claiming Party (the “Claimant”) shall promptly notify the other Party (the “Respondent”) in a dated written notice that a Dispute has arisen and describe the nature of the Dispute. Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to a mediator in a location of mutual agreement, but this agreement to mediate will not be binding, or require any party to settle in that location.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration in Beijing. The modified clause moves the dispute resolution to mediation, but states that the mediation agreement is not binding. This creates a legal contradiction. The contract initially specifies a clear and binding arbitration process, but the modification allows either party to disregard the mediation agreement, making the dispute resolution process uncertain and unenforceable. The original text follows PRC law for arbitration, while the altered text renders the dispute resolution mechanism non-binding.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that the parties would negotiate a cure period. This change makes the parties agree to a full waiver, which is in contradiction to the original provision, introducing legal uncertainty.",

If any controversy or claim arises\nrelating to this Agreement, the Parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate\na solution to their differences, including progressively escalating any\ncontroversy or claim through senior levels of management.  If negotiation does\nnot result in a resolution within 30 days of the date one Party first notifies\nthe other of the controversy or claim, either Party may resort to arbitration\nunder Section 8.2  [Arbitration].\n    8.2.  Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning\nany breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance\nof any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to this\nAgreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding\narbitration under this Section 8.2  [Arbitration] and the then-current Commercial Rules and\nsupervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\").

If the Parties are unable to agree upon\nthe arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select\nsuch arbitrator within 15 days thereafter.  The arbitrator's award will be final\nand binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitrator\nwill not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages\nexcluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this\nAgreement.  Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with\nthe federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all\nother respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the\nsubstantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",

                "explanation": "The restructuring of the sentence introduces contradiction—the first part states arbitration is mandatory, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on the dispute resolution method. This contradicts the original clause's strict arbitration requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The disclaimer of warranties, which is crucial for clearly defining the supplier's responsibility regarding the product's quality and performance, has been moved to a less noticeable location within the 'Force Majeure' section. Warranty disclaimers must be conspicuous to be enforceable; placing it within a section about unforeseen circumstances obscures its importance and makes it less likely to be noticed by the Reseller. This compromises transparency and increases the likelihood of disputes over product defects. The placement obscures the intent of the section and the warranty, leading to a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The governing law and jurisdiction clause, which should be in a general provision about law, has been inserted into the Intellectual Property section. This relocation makes it harder for a party unfamiliar with the contract to locate the applicable law and jurisdiction for resolving disputes, potentially leading to confusion and disputes over which legal framework applies and where disputes should be settled. This obscures the legal basis of the agreement, leading to a legal contradiction.",

FCPA deals with the responsibility to ensure anti-corruption, not merely an indemnity matter. By moving the FCPA clause, the clarity is obscured and introduces a legal contradiction by incorrectly associating compliance with indemnification rather than placing it within the 'General' provisions.

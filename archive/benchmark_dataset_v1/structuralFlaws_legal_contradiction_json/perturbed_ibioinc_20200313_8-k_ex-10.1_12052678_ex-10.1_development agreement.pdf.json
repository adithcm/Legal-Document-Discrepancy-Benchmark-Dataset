                "original_text": "8.6\nAttorney’s Fees. In the event that any claim, suit, action or proceeding is instituted or commenced by any Party hereto against any other Party arising out of or related to this Agreement, the prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert fees, expenses and court costs from the non-prevailing Party.",
                "changed_text": "8.6\nAttorney’s Fees. In the event that any claim, suit, action or proceeding is instituted or commenced by any Party hereto against any other Party arising out of or related to this Agreement, the prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert fees, expenses and court costs from the non-prevailing Party, contingent upon mutual agreement and only if the claim is related to intellectual property rights.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'contingent upon mutual agreement and only if the claim is related to intellectual property rights,' the clause's enforceability is weakened. Originally, the prevailing party was unconditionally entitled to recover fees. Now, the recovery is subject to the other party's agreement and is limited to IP disputes. This adds a condition where Texas law might grant broader entitlements.",

                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibits assignment without prior written consent, rendering unauthorized assignments void. The modified clause softens this by only requiring written notification and introducing a 90-day review period. While it doesn't explicitly allow assignment without consent, it removes the condition that unauthorized assignments are automatically void, creating ambiguity and potentially undermining the original intent. This is further compounded by the 90-day review period which implicitly acknowledges the possibility of an assignment being valid if unchallenged within that timeframe, thereby weakening the absolute prohibition of assignment without consent.",

                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for\nthe twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period\ncommencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval\nof that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December\n31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a “Contract Period”).",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall endeavor to purchase a desired Annual Order Volume (“DAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for\nthe twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The DAOVs are estimates and non-binding.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a 'Minimum Annual Order Volume (MAOV),' making it a binding requirement. Changing it to 'desired Annual Order Volume (DAOV)' and stating they are 'estimates and non-binding' fundamentally alters the commitment. This weakens Premier's obligation, potentially violating contract law principles requiring clear and binding agreements.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that all other terms remain in effect. By adding 'most' and 'unless superseded by subsequent communications,' the amendment introduces ambiguity and potential loopholes. This weakens the original agreement's enforceability, allowing for unilateral changes through unspecified 'subsequent communications.'",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Minimum Annual Order Volume' to 'anticipated Annual Order Volume' and removing the contingency upon facility approval significantly weakens Premier's obligation. Additionally, changing 'Contract Period' to 'Estimated Period' further undermines the enforceability and definiteness of the purchasing agreement, potentially rendering it illusory.",

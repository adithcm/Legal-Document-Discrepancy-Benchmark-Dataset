                "explanation": "The original clause mandates litigation in Houston, Texas. The modified clause introduces a contradiction by stating that disputes should first be resolved through friendly negotiation, potentially negating or delaying the original agreement for litigation in the specified forum, therefore impacting enforceability of the original dispute resolution agreement.",

The modified version waters down this guarantee by introducing uncertainty ('may or may not have been', 'use commercially reasonable effort to comply with') about WPD's commitment and historical compliance. This contradiction undermines the initial strong statement, creating ambiguity regarding data privacy obligations.",

The modification introduces ambiguity by stating CNS may *consider* terminating the agreement *with* an early termination penalty, contradicting the original immediate and penalty-free termination. Furthermore, the switch from 'is prohibited' to 'is encouraged from' regarding subcontractor usage without authorization weakens the control CNS has. Finally, the transition of using 'best efforts' to comply instead of full compliance, allows some leeway.",

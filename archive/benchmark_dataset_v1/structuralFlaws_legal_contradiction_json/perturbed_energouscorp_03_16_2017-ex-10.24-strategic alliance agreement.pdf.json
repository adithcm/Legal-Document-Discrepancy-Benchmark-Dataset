This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict of laws principles.\n\n19.2 Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any matters regarding its existence, scope, validity, breach or termination, or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or related to it) that is not able to be resolved through negotiations will be submitted to arbitration in San Francisco, California, administered by the International Chamber of Commerce under its Rules of Arbitration. There will be one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award will be in writing, state the reasons for the award and be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as may be required by law, the parties will preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be the sole and exclusive forum for final resolution of any such dispute or claim, provided, however, that, because each party will have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information of the other party, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which may cause irreparable harm and significant injury which may be difficult to ascertain and which may not be compensable by damages alone, the parties agree that the damaged party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that it may have for such unauthorized use or disclosure. Each party irrevocably waives all rights to a jury trial in any judicial proceeding permitted hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the validity, construction, and enforceability of this Agreement and the resolution of disputes arising out of and relating to this Agreement, will be governed solely by this Section 19.",

                "explanation": "The relocation of the 'Choice of Law and Dispute Resolution' clause to the 'Miscellaneous Provisions' section affects its prominence and could reduce enforceability. Law requires key legal provisions like dispute resolution to be clearly and conspicuously placed within the contract to ensure parties are aware of their rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "Moving the 'Mutual Representations and Warranties' subsection under the 'Definitions' section could diminish its enforceability. These warranties are crucial for establishing the legal standing and commitment of each party.

                "explanation": "Shifting the 'Compliance with Laws' section to the 'Product Commercialization' area diminishes its importance.

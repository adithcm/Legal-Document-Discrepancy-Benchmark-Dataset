                "explanation": "Moving the warranty disclaimer to the 'Customer Records' section makes it less prominent and buries it within clauses about auditing rights.

                "explanation": "Moving the 'Limited Warranty' section to directly after the 'Export' clause makes it less obvious to the reader.

                "explanation": "By adding the phrase \"EXCEPT IN CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE\", the limitation of liability clause is significantly weakened. The original clause provided a blanket protection against special, indirect, exemplary, or consequential damages, but the modification introduces an exception for cases involving gross negligence. This contradiction makes the enforceability of the original liability limitation uncertain, as a claim of gross negligence could potentially bypass the limitation.",

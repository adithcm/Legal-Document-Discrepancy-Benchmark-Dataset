On the first day of each calendar quarter, the Reseller will provide Todos with a non-binding rolling weekly\nforecast of the Reseller’s estimated Product purchase requirements over the upcoming six months (the “Forecasts”).\n3.6 Todos shall comply with all relevant standards of quality assurance and shall ensure that the Products conform to all Israeli standards\nand certifications.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Todos will ensure the products conform to all Israeli standards and certifications, a claim about product compliance. Moving this statement to after the reseller acknowledges the lack of AMAR approval in section 4.15 and inserting the section about forecast blurs the line of what Todos is promising. This obscures the clarity of Todos' commitment to meet Israeli standards, as it is now positioned after an acknowledgement of missing critical approvals, and the forecast section makes the claim less prominent.",

                "explanation": "The original section stipulated arbitration within the state of Israel. The modified text moves it to another section that deals with exclusivity. This clause is modified to remove the arbitration requirements in accordance with the Arbitration Law and states the disputes will be settled by agreement, making it difficult to enforce. This introduces ambiguity and makes it more difficult to enforce arbitration.",

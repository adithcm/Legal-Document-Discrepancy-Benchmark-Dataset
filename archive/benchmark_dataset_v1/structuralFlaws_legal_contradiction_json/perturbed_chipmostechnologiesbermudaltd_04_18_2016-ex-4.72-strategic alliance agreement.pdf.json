The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney’s fees).",

Such documents or agreements shall be null and void immediately and cease to be applied. Except as otherwise provided herein, both Parties’ consent in writing is necessary to amend, waive, rescind or terminate the Agreement or any terms and conditions.\n3.1\tGoverning Law and Jurisdiction This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of Taiwan.

                "explanation": "The arbitration clause, which specifies the method of dispute resolution, has been moved to a section describing governing law and amendment of the contract. This makes it less prominent and potentially more difficult to find, undermining its enforceability because dispute resolution clauses are expected to be clearly delineated.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lack of clear, prominent placement of dispute resolution clause may violate general principles of contract law requiring clear and conspicuous terms, depending on specific jurisdiction interpretations.",

However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement.",

Tsinghua Unigroup shall also introduce other potential suppliers, customers and business partners in Mainland China to ChipMOS.\n\n3.9 Confidentiality The Parties agree that the Parties will not disclose information in connection with the execution, existence, content, and performance of this Agreement to any third party before the Parties have made an announcement to the public pursuant to Section 3.11 of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "The confidentiality clause, typically expected in the 'Miscellaneous' section, is moved to Article 1, Section 1.1 where the strategic alliance content is. This weakens its enforceability because a critical protection of information is now buried within the operational details of the alliance instead of being clearly and separately defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law related to clear and conspicuous terms, especially concerning confidentiality, are undermined.",

                "original_text": "ARBITRATION: All disputes in connection with this Contract or the execution thereof shall be settled friendly through negotiations. In case no settlement can be reached, the case may then be submitted for arbitration to the Foreign Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee of the China Beijing Council for the Promotion of International Trade in accordance with its Provisional Rules of Procedures by the said Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration shall take place in Beijing and the decision of the Arbitration Committee shall be final and binding upon both parties; neither party shall seek recourse to a law court nor other authorities to appeal for revision of the decision.

The Arbitration shall take place in Shenzhen and the decision of the Arbitration Committee shall be final and non-binding upon both parties; either party shall be able to appeal for revision of the decision. Arbitration fee shall be borne by both parties.",
                "explanation": "By changing the arbitration location from Beijing to Shenzhen and arbitration decision non-binding, it contradicts standard arbitration practices, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable under PRC law which generally expects binding arbitration decisions. Furthermore, making the arbitration fee be borne by both parties contradicts the last sentence of the original clause.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'remitted' to 'may remit' and adding 'or at the discretion of the buyer' weakens the obligation of the buyer to pay via T/T, creating uncertainty about the payment terms and contradicting the original intent of a defined payment schedule. This weakens enforceability under commercial law principles.",

                "explanation": "By weakening the inspection standards, disallowing China Commodity Inspection Bureau claims, eliminating expenses borne by seller, altering acceptance of certificate of claim, eliminating seller's responsibility to eliminate defects and altering 'accepted' to 'under discussion', the new claim clauses introduces substantial uncertainty in the claims process, potentially discouraging claims and favoring the seller. This contradicts standard sales of goods principles that require clear and fair claims procedures.",

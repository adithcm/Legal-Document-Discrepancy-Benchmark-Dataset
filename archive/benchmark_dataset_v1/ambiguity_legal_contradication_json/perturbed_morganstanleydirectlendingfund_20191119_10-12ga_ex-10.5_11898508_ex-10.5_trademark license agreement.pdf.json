                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Licensee’s Permitted Activity shall be in a manner consistent with Licensor’s high standards of and reputation for quality, and in accordance with good trademark practice wherever any of the same are used. Licensee shall not take any action that could reasonably be expected to harm the Brand or the goodwill associated therewith. Licensee shall use with the Brand any applicable trademark notices as may be requested by Licensor or required under applicable laws, regulations, stock exchange and other rules (“Laws”) and reputable industry practice.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee’s Permitted Activity shall be generally consistent with Licensor’s standards for quality, and in accordance with what Licensee considers acceptable trademark practice wherever the Brand is used. Licensee should avoid taking actions that foreseeably harm the Brand or its associated goodwill. Licensee may use trademark notices with the Brand if Licensor suggests it, or if Licensee believes it is necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for quality control and adherence to trademark law. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'generally consistent,' 'what Licensee considers acceptable,' 'should avoid,' and 'may use,' making the licensee's obligations discretionary rather than mandatory. This weakens the enforceability of the quality control and trademark protection provisions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lanham Act (15 U.S. Code § 1114) which requires a trademark owner to maintain control over the nature and quality of the goods or services sold under the mark. The changes dilute the obligation for quality control making it harder for Licensor to prove they maintained sufficient control, potentially endangering the trademark.",

                "changed_text": "Prior to widespread use of the Brand, Licensee will attempt to submit proposed uses to Licensor for approval.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall submit' with 'will attempt to submit' and adding the caveat 'prior to widespread use' introduces uncertainty and makes compliance discretionary. It undermines the licensor's control over brand usage by the licensee, a critical aspect of trademark licensing agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lanham Act (15 U.S. Code § 1114) because the licensor is not maintaining strict control over the use of the trademark.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee will endeavor to comply with applicable Laws and industry norms relating to the Licensee Business and Permitted Activity, insofar as reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'will endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation, and the addition of 'insofar as reasonably practical' introduces a subjective element, making it difficult to enforce compliance with applicable laws. This could lead to non-compliance with various regulations applicable to the Licensee's business.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal regulations applicable to investment companies and business development companies, which require strict compliance, not just 'endeavoring' to comply. Examples include the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933.",

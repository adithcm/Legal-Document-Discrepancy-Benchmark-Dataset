            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor will comply with all country, federal, state and local laws, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, policies and procedures, Including, without limitation, all anti-corruption laws, Including, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Applicable Laws). Distributor can find more information about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, or by contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will endeavor to comply with all country, federal, state and local laws, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, policies and procedures, and shall strive to uphold anti-corruption laws, with resources and guidance available regarding the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Applicable Laws) at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, or by contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear obligation for the distributor to comply with all applicable laws, including anti-corruption laws like the FCPA. By changing 'will comply' to 'will endeavor to comply' and 'shall strive to uphold,' the obligation becomes ambiguous and less stringent. The term 'endeavor' doesn't guarantee compliance, creating uncertainty about the distributor's responsibility to adhere to these laws. This weakens the legally binding nature of the clause.",

                "original_text": "Distributor shall not take any action or permit or authorize any action in violation of the Applicable Laws;",
                "changed_text": "Distributor should generally refrain from taking any action knowingly in violation of the Applicable Laws;",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a strict prohibition against any action violating applicable laws. The revised text softens this prohibition by using 'should generally refrain' and 'knowingly'. 'Should generally refrain' implies that violations may be acceptable under certain circumstances, and 'knowingly' suggests that unintentional violations are permissible. This ambiguity creates a loophole for potential violations of laws, including anti-corruption laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)",
                "location": "Section 21.1(b)"

                "changed_text": "Distributor aims to encourage its own relevant subcontractors, consultants, agents or representatives who interact with government affiliated organizations to be mindful of anti-corruption laws;",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a responsibility on the distributor to ensure compliance from its subcontractors and agents. The modified text weakens this obligation by changing 'remains responsible for undertaking appropriate and reasonable measures to ensure' to 'aims to encourage...to be mindful'. Encouraging mindfulness is a far less stringent requirement than ensuring compliance, making it unclear what actions the distributor must take. This ambiguity could result in a failure to adequately prevent corruption by related parties, potentially violating the FCPA if these parties engage in corrupt practices.",

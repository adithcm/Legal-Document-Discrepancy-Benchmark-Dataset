                "original_text": "Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Investor, Investors’ Affiliates, and their officers and directors, and their direct and indirect customers, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, diminution in value, deficiencies, actions, proceedings, taxes, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of investigation as incurred, arising out of or relating to any breach of any of the representations made in this Article 3.09.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall endeavor to indemnify and hold harmless Investor, Investors’ Affiliates, and their officers and directors, and their direct and indirect customers, from and against losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, diminution in value, deficiencies, actions, proceedings, taxes, costs and expenses arising out of or relating to any breach of any of the representations made in this Article 3.09, subject to available resources.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates indemnification. The modified text uses 'endeavor' and 'subject to available resources,' making the indemnification obligation discretionary. 'Endeavor' does not guarantee actual indemnification, and 'subject to available resources' creates uncertainty about the company's ability to fulfill this obligation, allowing them to potentially avoid indemnification even when it is legally required.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract/Fiduciary Duty. While not directly violating a statute, it introduces ambiguity that could render the indemnification clause unenforceable, potentially violating contract law principles requiring clear and definite obligations.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Company elects to abandon any patent application, to not pay maintenance fees or annuities to keep a patent in force, or to otherwise take or fail to take any action that will result in a loss of patent rights, Company shall give Investor at least sixty (60) days prior written notice and an opportunity to take over the prosecution of the patent application that would be abandoned and/or pay the fees necessary to keep the patent in force and/or take any other action necessary to avoid the loss of patent rights.",
                "changed_text": "Company will generally have the right to file, prosecute, and maintain Patents covering the inventions that are the property of Company and may determine whether or not, and where, to file a patent application, to abandon the prosecution of any patent or patent application, or to discontinue the maintenance of any patent or patent application, subject to good faith considerations. If Company considers abandoning any patent application or failing to maintain a patent, it should attempt to provide Investor with reasonable notice and opportunity to potentially address the matter.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'sole right' to 'generally have the right' and 'shall give' to 'should attempt to provide' weakens the obligation. 'Subject to good faith considerations' introduces a subjective element to the company's decision-making process regarding patent prosecution and maintenance. 'Reasonable notice' is vague compared to the original 'sixty (60) days prior written notice,' making it easier for the company to avoid the original obligation. This ambiguity could lead to a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Replacing the specific exceptions with 'commercially reasonable efforts' and 'justifiable by Investor's internal counsel' creates significant ambiguity. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' is subjective and weaker than a strict prohibition. The clause 'justifiable by Investor's internal counsel' allows the investor to disclose information at its discretion, potentially undermining the confidentiality agreement. It is ambiguous and may be difficult to determine if this has occurred. The internal counsel gets to be the sole arbiter, which could be viewed as bad faith.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Aimmune shall keep Xencor informed as to its progress and activities relating to the Development, Manufacture and Commercialization of the Product on [***] basis (i.e., every [***] ([***]) months), including by providing updates on the status of studies necessary for obtaining Regulatory Approval with respect to the Product, regulatory matters and meetings with Regulatory Authorities with respect to the Product, and Commercialization activities commencing no later than [***] ([***]) year prior to the date on which Aimmune estimates the First Commercial Sale of Product will occur. Additionally, to the extent applicable, such updates shall include summaries of Aimmune’s Development plans for the Product for the ensuing [***] ([***]) year time period. Any information disclosed under this Section 2.5 shall be treated as Confidential Information as defined in Section 12.1.",
                "changed_text": "Aimmune will endeavor to keep Xencor generally informed of its progress and activities relating to the Development, Manufacture, and Commercialization of the Product, possibly on a(n) [***] basis (i.e., around every [***] ([***]) months). Updates may include information regarding the status of studies for Regulatory Approval, regulatory matters, meetings with Regulatory Authorities, and Commercialization activities, potentially commencing around [***] ([***]) year prior to Aimmune's projected First Commercial Sale. Summaries of Aimmune's Development plans for the coming [***] ([***]) year time period might be provided, as deemed appropriate. Any information disclosed under this Section 2.5 will be regarded as Confidential Information as outlined in Section 12.1.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the obligation to provide regular and detailed updates. Replacing \"shall keep informed\" with \"will endeavor to keep generally informed\" makes the obligation less stringent. The use of \"possibly\" and \"around\" when describing the frequency of updates and commencement of commercialization activities makes these aspects of the obligation unclear. The addition of \"might be provided, as deemed appropriate\" regarding summaries of development plans introduces further discretion. This weakens the original intent of keeping Xencor closely informed about the progress and activities related to the Product. The changes are ambiguous and weaken the legal obligation to report information.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change could potentially lead to disputes over whether Aimmune adequately kept Xencor informed, impacting Xencor's ability to monitor the project's progress and protect its interests. While no specific law is directly violated, the lack of clear, consistent reporting could hinder effective oversight, which is essential in regulated industries like pharmaceuticals where transparency is crucial for compliance and risk management.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Aimmune shall conduct the Development Activities in accordance with sound and ethical business and scientific practices, and in compliance with all Applicable Law, including GCPs and GLPs, and also including all applicable data privacy and data protection laws.",
                "changed_text": "Aimmune will aim to conduct the Development Activities with what it considers reasonable business and scientific practices, and will attempt to comply with Applicable Law, including GCPs and GLPs, and data privacy and data protection laws.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces definitive obligations with discretionary efforts, weakening compliance standards. The original text requires strict adherence to ethical practices and all Applicable Laws. The revised text, using terms like 'aim to conduct' and 'attempt to comply,' introduces ambiguity and makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This can lead to varying interpretations and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change can create non-compliance with regulatory requirements in pharmaceutical development. FDA regulations, such as 21 CFR Part 58 (Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies) and 21 CFR Part 312 (Investigational New Drug Application), require strict compliance with GLP and GCP standards. By weakening the obligation to comply, the modified text contradicts these requirements, potentially leading to regulatory issues and jeopardizing product approval.",

                "original_text": "The audit shall be limited to pertinent records kept by Aimmune and its Affiliates and Sublicensees for any year ending not more than [***] ([***]) months prior to the date of the written notice. An audit under this Section 8.4 shall not occur more than [***] in any Calendar Year, except in the case of any subsequent “for cause” audit. The accounting firm shall disclose to Xencor only whether the reports are correct or incorrect and the specific details concerning any discrepancies. No other information shall be provided to Xencor. The accounting firm shall provide Aimmune with a copy of any disclosures or reports made to Xencor and Aimmune shall have an opportunity to discuss such disclosures or reports with Xencor and the accounting firm. Information, disclosures, or reports arising from any such examination shall be Confidential Information of Aimmune subject to the confidentiality and other obligations of ARTICLE 12. Prompt adjustments shall be made by the Parties to reflect the results of such audit.",
                "changed_text": "The audit will typically be limited to records Aimmune deems pertinent, kept by Aimmune and its Affiliates and Sublicensees for recent years. Generally, audits under this Section 8.4 will be infrequent, except in cases of a potential \"for cause\" situation. The accounting firm is expected to inform Xencor whether the reports appear accurate and highlight any significant discrepancies it identifies. The specifics of what is considered to be confidential will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Adjustments may be considered by the Parties to perhaps reflect the results of any such audit.",
                "explanation": "The insertion of discretionary language significantly reduces the enforceability of the audit clause. By stating that the audit will 'typically' be limited to records 'Aimmune deems pertinent', Aimmune gains control over which records are accessible. Changing 'shall be limited' to 'will typically be limited' and 'kept for recent years' introduces further ambiguity. Additionally, 'expected to inform' is less direct than 'shall disclose.' The change from 'Prompt adjustments shall be made' to 'Adjustments may be considered' reduces the obligation to correct inaccuracies. This overall weakening could hinder Xencor's ability to verify royalty payments effectively.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change could potentially contradict general principles of contract law, which require good faith and fair dealing. While not a direct violation of a specific law, impeding Xencor's ability to audit financial records thoroughly could lead to disputes over the accuracy of royalty payments and may be seen as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith. The weakened audit clause also limits Xencor's ability to ensure compliance with financial reporting standards.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall monitor and censor all Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including without limitation Content posted by end users. Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee’s failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to monitor and censor Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including Content posted by end users. Licensor may also monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee will attempt to remove overtly offensive Content, such as materials reasonably believed to be illegal, highly pornographic, or materials inciting violence, from such websites when feasible. Licensee’s potential failure to fully comply with this Section 3.3(a) might be considered a factor when assessing overall compliance. Licensor retains the option to remove content from the websites.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity and discretion where the original text was definitive. 'Shall monitor' is replaced with 'shall endeavor to monitor,' weakening the obligation. The definition of 'offending content' is softened with 'overtly offensive Content' and 'reasonably believed,' making the standard subjective. Replacing the strict removal timeline with 'when feasible' introduces further ambiguity. This contradicts the strict content control laws in China, which require definitive action and leave no room for subjective interpretation or discretionary enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall ensure' with 'shall make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure,' significantly weakening the obligation. The addition of 'generally complies' and limiting the scope to 'major aspects' introduces further ambiguity and allows for non-compliance with certain laws. Under Chinese law, businesses must strictly adhere to all applicable laws and regulations, not just 'generally' comply or make 'commercially reasonable efforts.'",

                "changed_text": "Licensor should aim to make available to Licensee the Licensed Content in a manner that approximates the speed and efficiency with which such Licensed Content was made available to SINA Leju prior to the Effective Date, potentially through Licensor’s content database, but generally aiming for a comparable level of access to that provided for its own operations.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'shall make available' to 'should aim to make available,' making the obligation less mandatory. The phrase 'substantially the same' is replaced with 'approximates the speed and efficiency,' creating vagueness. The 'but in no event with less speed, efficiency...' clause is weakened to 'generally aiming for a comparable level of access,' which is subjective and less enforceable. This introduces ambiguity regarding the guaranteed level of service, potentially conflicting with requirements under Chinese contract law for clear and defined obligations.",

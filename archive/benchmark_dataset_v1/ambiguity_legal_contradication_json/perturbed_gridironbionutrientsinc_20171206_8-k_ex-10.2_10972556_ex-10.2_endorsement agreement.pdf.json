Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter\nbeginning on the first full quarter [three (3) month period] of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis\nthereafter for the term of this Agreement.

                "changed_text": "A donation of approximately $0.05 per Unit sold of Licensed Products within the Contract Territory, if deemed appropriate, may be payable to the NFL Alumni Northern California Chapter. Donated amounts may be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter periodically, as reasonably determined by the Company, for a duration to be decided. While the following per Unit conversion may apply:",
                "explanation": "The terms 'approximately,' 'if deemed appropriate,' 'may be,' 'periodically,' and 'as reasonably determined by the Company' introduce ambiguity regarding the donation amount, the obligation to pay, the frequency of allocation, and the duration of the agreement. It moves the donation from a fixed obligation to a discretionary action.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires charitable donations to be clearly defined and consistently applied as promised. This weakens the commitment to donate the described amount, violating consumer protection laws against deceptive practices and potentially breaching charitable trust principles.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will provide' to 'will endeavor to provide' and adding 'if feasible' weakens the obligation to provide the sales report. Further, stating 'with the timing and content at the Company's discretion' gives the company complete control over whether and how to provide the report, undermining transparency and accountability.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Corporations Code requires transparency and accurate record-keeping, especially concerning financial transactions related to charitable donations. This undermines the NFLA-NC's ability to verify the donation amounts, creating a potential violation of transparency requirements for charitable partnerships.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'may be added' to 'might be considered' makes the addition of products less certain. Replacing 'must be signed by all parties' with 'may require mutual consent' creates ambiguity about the required level of agreement for amendments, potentially allowing for unilateral changes or disagreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "California contract law requires that contract amendments be mutually agreed upon and clearly documented. Making the amendment process vague could lead to disputes and a potential breach of contract due to lack of clarity on the amendment requirements.",

In connection with any HDS' usage of Celebrity Attributes as outlined above in Paragraphs 3(A)-(C), HDS will \nfeature the following disclaimer in close proximity to said usage: \"PAUL SILAS IS NOT A MEDICAL \nAUTHORITY.

In connection with any HDS' usage of Celebrity Attributes as outlined above in Paragraphs 3(A)-(C), HDS will endeavor to feature the following disclaimer in proximity to said usage: \"PAUL SILAS IS NOT A MEDICAL AUTHORITY. THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY EVALUATED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT NECESSARILY INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, CURE OR PREVENT ANY DISEASE.\"",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'will feature' with 'will endeavor to feature,' making the inclusion of the disclaimer discretionary rather than mandatory. It changes 'have not been evaluated' to 'have not been fully evaluated,' implying a partial evaluation which can mislead consumers. It also changes 'is not intended' to 'is not necessarily intended,' weakening the statement about the product's intended use. This contradicts FDA regulations regarding clear and accurate labeling and advertising of products, potentially leading to consumer deception and violation of consumer protection laws.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'generally be merchantable and reasonably fit for a broad understanding' weakens the warranty of merchantability and fitness for purpose, allowing for potential defects or unsuitability. Changing 'will conform at all times' to 'will, to the best of HDS's understanding, attempt to conform' introduces a subjective element, making compliance dependent on HDS's interpretation and effort rather than strict adherence. This weakens the legal protection offered by warranties and regulatory compliance, potentially violating consumer protection laws and FDA regulations regarding product safety and efficacy.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless' with 'will endeavor to indemnify, defend and hold harmless', HDS introduces ambiguity and reduces the strength of its indemnification obligation. Adding qualifications like 'gross breach,' 'specific terms explicitly made', 'direct HDS product liability,' 'directly featuring Celebrity' and 'intentional performance of HDS' duties', limits the scope of the indemnity, making it difficult for Celebrity to claim indemnification. The inclusion of 'demonstrably incurred' limits the scope of expenses. This reduces the contractual protections for the celebrity by making indemnification discretionary.",

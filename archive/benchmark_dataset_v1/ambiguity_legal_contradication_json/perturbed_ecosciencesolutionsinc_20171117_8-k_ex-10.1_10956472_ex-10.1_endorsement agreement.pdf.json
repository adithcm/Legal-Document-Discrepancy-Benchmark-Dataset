                "explanation": "The original text makes a clear and unambiguous assertion that ESSI's products *will* conform to all applicable laws and standards. The modified text weakens this obligation by stating that ESSI will *endeavor* to conform and adding the subjective qualifier 'to the best of their understanding.' This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of effort and knowledge required for compliance, potentially leading to non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless' to 'will attempt to indemnify, defend and hold harmless,' the certainty of ESSI's obligation is significantly reduced. This creates ambiguity about the extent to which ESSI is truly responsible for covering the liabilities listed, potentially conflicting with standard legal expectations for indemnification clauses.",

At no time whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever, is Talent authorized to discuss ESSI's financial condition, either in speculation or actual knowledge of such.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly prohibits Talent from discussing ESSI's financial condition in any manner. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the endorsement is for the 'primary purpose' and changing 'At no time whatsoever...is Talent authorized' to 'Talent should generally avoid discussing.' Adding 'general understanding' and 'to the best of his ability' further weakens the restriction, making it unclear when discussing financial matters would be acceptable. This change could potentially allow Talent to disclose information that should be confidential.",

                "changed_text": "Vyera shall use what it believes are Commercially Reasonable Efforts in connection with such Commercialization of Licensed Products in the Territory for each indication in the Field for which such Licensed Products have received Regulatory Approval, and shall conduct Commercialization activities with the intent of complying with Applicable Laws and ensure that its Third Party contractors attempt to conduct Commercialization activities in accordance with Applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" with \"what it believes are Commercially Reasonable Efforts,\" the clause introduces a subjective assessment, creating ambiguity as to the required standard of effort. Replacing \"material compliance\" with \"intent of complying\" weakens the obligation, making actual compliance discretionary. Furthermore, the phrase \"attempt to conduct\" introduces uncertainty about the strict adherence to Applicable Laws by third-party contractors.",

CytoDyn shall promptly furnish Vyera with copies of all material correspondence or minutes of material meetings with the FDA in each case relating to the Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "CytoDyn should endeavor to provide Vyera with notice of any scheduled meeting with the FDA relating to Development and/or the BLA for the Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory. Vyera may have the option to observe (if feasible under FDA guidelines) and potentially participate, if CytoDyn consents. CytoDyn will attempt to furnish Vyera with copies of correspondence or minutes of meetings with the FDA in each case relating to the Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"shall provide\" with \"should endeavor to provide,\" the clause makes providing notice of FDA meetings discretionary. Changing \"shall have the right\" to \"may have the option\" makes Vyera's observation and participation conditional and uncertain. Replacing \"shall promptly furnish\" with \"will attempt to furnish\" weakens the obligation to provide correspondence and minutes, making it non-mandatory. This creates a vague and unenforceable legal statement.",

Upon reasonable prior notice, but not more than once per Calendar Year, such records of Vyera and its Affiliates shall be available during Vyera’s and its Affiliates regular business hours for a period of three (3) years from the end of the Calendar Year to which they pertain for examination at the expense of CytoDyn by an independent certified public accountant selected by CytoDyn and reasonably acceptable to Vyera, for the sole purpose of verifying the accuracy of the financial reports and correctness of the payments furnished by Vyera pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Vyera will aim to maintain reasonably complete and accurate records allowing CytoDyn to generally assess the calculation of royalties and milestones due under this Agreement. Upon what Vyera deems reasonable prior notice, and subject to its internal policies, such records of Vyera and its Affiliates may be available during standard business hours for a period that Vyera considers appropriate for a limited review at CytoDyn’s expense by an accountant. The primary goal of this review is to gain a general understanding of the financial reports and payments furnished by Vyera pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by replacing \"complete and accurate records\" with \"reasonably complete and accurate records,\" making the standard subjective. Substituting \"permit CytoDyn to confirm the accuracy\" with \"allowing CytoDyn to generally assess\" weakens the confirmation process. Replacing \"reasonable prior notice\" with \"what Vyera deems reasonable prior notice\" gives Vyera full discretion. Modifying \"for a period of three (3) years\" to \"period that Vyera considers appropriate\" makes record availability uncertain. Replacing \"verifying the accuracy\" with \"gain a general understanding\" lowers the audit’s objective, leading to ambiguities in enforcement. This contradicts GAAP.",
                "contradicted_law": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which requires maintaining and providing access to accurate financial records for auditing purposes, a standard undermined by the introduced ambiguities.",

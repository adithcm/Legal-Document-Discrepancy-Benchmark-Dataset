                "explanation": "Replacing \"agrees to serve\" with \"will endeavor to serve\" and \"will use its best efforts to provide\" with \"will attempt to provide\" weakens Bravatek's commitment to finding sales leads. This introduces ambiguity as to the level of effort required and whether a failure to find leads constitutes a breach of contract. What consists of 'attempt' is left to interpretation.",

                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO\nand delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee,\nto be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an\nexact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days\nafter each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients vaguely connected with Bravatek and delivered through potentially affiliated channels, Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, subject to COMPANY's discretion, potentially within the range of 10% to 20% of project revenue, based on vaguely defined factors, possibly payable after client payment.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces several ambiguities: \"vaguely connected with Bravatek\" makes it unclear how direct the connection must be. \"Potentially affiliated channels\" raises questions about whether sales through non-designated channels qualify. \"Subject to COMPANY's discretion\" gives COMPANY broad leeway in deciding whether to pay a fee. \"Based on vaguely defined factors\" removes clear criteria for determining the fee amount and \"Possibly payable after client payment\" creates uncertainty about the payment schedule. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "For a period of five (5) years after termination of this Agreement, the parties shall treat as confidential all information and take every\nreasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the same. The parties agree to take all steps\nreasonably necessary and appropriate to ensure that their employees, agents, and/or assistants treat all information as confidential and to\nensure that such employees, agents, and/or assistants are familiar with and abide by the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "For a period of approximately five (5) years after termination of this Agreement, the parties should generally treat information as confidential and consider taking precautions to prevent disclosure. The parties should encourage their personnel to respect confidentiality.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"five (5) years\" with \"approximately five (5) years\" introduces ambiguity about the exact duration. Replacing \"shall treat as confidential\" with \"should generally treat information as confidential\" weakens the obligation. Replacing \"take every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts\" with \"consider taking precautions\" makes the duty discretionary. Changing the last sentence from an agreement to 'take all steps reasonably necessary' to 'should encourage their personnel' significantly reduces the binding force of the confidentiality provision. This creates a weaker, less enforceable obligation to maintain confidentiality.",

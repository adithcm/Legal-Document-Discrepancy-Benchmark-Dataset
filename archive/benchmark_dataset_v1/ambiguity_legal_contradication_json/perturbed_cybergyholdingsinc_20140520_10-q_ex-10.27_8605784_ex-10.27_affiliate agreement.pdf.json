                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "MA shall be responsible and shall bear all costs for complying with local, state, provincial, federal, national, and international statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances of any kind which related to or affect MA’s duties under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "MA will endeavor to be responsible and bear reasonable costs associated with complying with applicable statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances which are deemed relevant to MA’s duties under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing \"shall be responsible\" with \"will endeavor to be responsible,\" making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. \"Reasonable costs\" is vague, and \"deemed relevant\" gives MA subjective power to decide which laws apply, conflicting with mandatory compliance standards. This contradicts legal requirements for strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies depending on the jurisdiction, but generally conflicts with any law requiring mandatory compliance, such as environmental regulations, labor laws, or data protection laws.",

                "changed_text": "MA will make commercially reasonable efforts to protect copyrights, tradenames, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other confidential proprietary rights and information of Company and its affiliates. MA will report infringements or suspected infringements as deemed necessary and will cooperate with Company in a manner considered appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity with the phrase \"commercially reasonable efforts,\" weakening the obligation to protect intellectual property. \"As deemed necessary\" gives MA discretion in reporting infringements. Replacing \"cooperate fully\" with \"cooperate in a manner considered appropriate\" further reduces the obligation, conflicting with requirements for diligent IP protection. This weakens protections afforded to intellectual property, which could be a violation of intellectual property laws.",

                "changed_text": "MA will maintain records of sales of the Technology and Maintenance, and will provide these records for review by a representative of Company when practical.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the record-keeping obligation by removing the requirement for \"accurate records\" and the specific timeframe for providing them. Replacing \"shall keep accurate records\" with \"will maintain records\" allows for less stringent record-keeping. Removing the phrase \"within ten (10) business days following the end of each month\" and replacing with \"when practical\" gives MA discretion over when to provide records, contradicting clear accounting principles and audit requirements and potentially violating tax laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "IRS regulations regarding record-keeping, and potentially securities laws if the records are inaccurate.",

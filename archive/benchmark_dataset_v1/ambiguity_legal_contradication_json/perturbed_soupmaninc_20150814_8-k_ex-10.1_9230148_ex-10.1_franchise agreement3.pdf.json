                "changed_text": "The Master Franchise Agreement may provide for termination upon bankruptcy under certain circumstances. This provision's enforceability will be subject to interpretation of Federal Bankruptcy Law (11 U.S.C.A. Sec. 101 et seq.).",
                "explanation": "The original text acknowledges the potential unenforceability of the termination clause upon bankruptcy. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'may provide' and 'subject to interpretation,' weakening the franchisee's understanding of their rights and the enforceability of the clause under Federal Bankruptcy Law.",

Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.",
                "changed_text": "The Master Franchise Agreement suggests non-binding mediation. The mediation will preferably occur in New York, with costs ideally shared equally. Prospective franchisees may consider consulting legal counsel regarding the potential applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to venue restrictions.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a requirement for non-binding mediation in New York. The modified version uses weaker language like 'suggests,' 'preferably,' 'ideally,' and 'may consider,' making the mediation process and location less definite. This weakens the franchisee's rights and introduces ambiguity regarding the mandatory nature of mediation and cost allocation, making compliance with California's franchise laws (related to fair venue and dispute resolution) uncertain.",

Business and Professions Code 20010 might affect a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Relations Act (Business and Professions Code 20000 through 20043).",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the requirement to sign a release and that California law voids waivers of certain rights. The modified version uses less definite language like 'expected' and 'might affect,' creating uncertainty about the mandatory nature of the release and the extent to which California law protects the franchisee's rights, therefore creating ambiguity where the release will hold up in court.",

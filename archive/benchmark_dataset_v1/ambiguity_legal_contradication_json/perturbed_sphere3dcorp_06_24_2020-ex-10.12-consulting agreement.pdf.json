                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Company shall provide disclosures in each of its Forms 10-K and 10-Q as to the existence of this Agreement and any Statement of Work, the amount paid or to be paid in connection with each Statement of Work and the types of services to be provided under each Statement of Work.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will endeavor to provide disclosures in its periodic reports as it deems appropriate regarding this Agreement and any associated work.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates disclosures in Forms 10-K and 10-Q. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using 'endeavor to provide,' 'as it deems appropriate' and replaces the specific forms with 'periodic reports', making the disclosure requirement discretionary and vague, potentially allowing the Company to avoid full disclosure.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "During the Term, the Company shall advise Consultant of any and all promotional activities with respect to its securities, prior to the commencement of such activities, including, but not limited to, press releases and engagements with other investment relations firms or other service providers providing services similar to those or the Services provided in a Statement of Work.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, the Company will attempt to inform Consultant of significant promotional activities related to its securities, at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall advise' with 'will attempt to inform' and 'any and all' with 'significant', adding 'at its discretion.' This makes informing the Consultant about promotional activities optional and dependent on the Company's judgment, creating uncertainty. This can impact the Consultant's ability to maintain compliance with securities laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require transparency and accurate information dissemination.",

                "original_text": "Consultant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, the Parent, and each of their members, their affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, “Indemnitees”) from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) demands, fines, penalties, injunctions, suits and causes of action of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively referred to as “Damages”) instituted by any third party and arising out of Consultant’s performance of services under this Consulting Agreement, unless said Damages arise out of the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, its members, affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, successors and assigns.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant will endeavor to indemnify the Company against certain claims arising from Consultant’s actions, to the extent permissible by law and as determined reasonable by the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires the Consultant to indemnify the Company against all claims, losses, etc., arising from the Consultant's performance, except in cases of negligence or willful misconduct by the Company. The modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless' with 'will endeavor to indemnify,' weakening the obligation. Adding 'to the extent permissible by law and as determined reasonable by the Company' introduces a subjective standard determined solely by the Company, potentially negating the indemnity obligation. This ambiguity makes the extent of indemnification unclear and open to dispute.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms, particularly in indemnity clauses. The ambiguous language creates uncertainty and could render the clause unenforceable.",

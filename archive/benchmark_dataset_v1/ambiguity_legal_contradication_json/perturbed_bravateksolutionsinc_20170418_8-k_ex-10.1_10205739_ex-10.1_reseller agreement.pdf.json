                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Company shall comply with good business practices and all applicable laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Company should endeavor to comply with generally accepted business practices and most applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'should endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation. Adding 'generally accepted' and 'most applicable' introduces subjective interpretation, creating ambiguity around which laws and regulations the company must follow. This could lead to non-compliance with mandatory regulations, as the company might argue that a specific law is not 'generally accepted' or 'most applicable'.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'will be paid within thirty (30) days' with 'will generally be paid within approximately thirty (30) days after, ideally, the collection of receivables' makes the payment term ambiguous and unenforceable. Adding 'generally,' 'approximately,' and 'ideally' introduces subjectivity, and it is hard to define 'after, ideally'. This contradicts standard contract law principles requiring clear payment terms.",

                "changed_text": "Additionally, Reseller will attempt to indemnify Company and its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents, successors and assigns, from losses, including potentially reasonable attorneys’ fees, arguably arising from claims that the Reseller’s Activities somewhat infringe U.S. Business law or that the Reseller’s Activities possibly violate a U.S. government process, procedure or requirement or from injuries loosely related to the Reseller’s Activities. ",
                "explanation": "The language weakens the legal obligation. Removing “shall”, replacing “defend and hold harmless” with “attempt to indemnify”, and adding words like “potentially,” “arguably,” “somewhat,” and “possibly” introduce significant ambiguity regarding the extent of the Reseller's indemnification duties. The phrase ‘loosely related’ creates uncertainty about the type of injuries covered. This undermines the indemnification clause, making it difficult to enforce and increasing risk for Company.",

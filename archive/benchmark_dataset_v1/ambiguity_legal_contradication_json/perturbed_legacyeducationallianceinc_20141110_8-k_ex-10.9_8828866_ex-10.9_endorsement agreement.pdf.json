                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Talent shall have the right of approval in respect of all Product being proposed as any part of the Property appearing or integrated into it and all proposed use of the Property (including to whom the Property is distributed for sale if other than the general public) prior to public release and distribution.",
                "changed_text": "Talent may express preferences regarding the Product being proposed as any part of the Property appearing or integrated into it and all proposed use of the Property prior to public release and distribution.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall have the right of approval' to 'may express preferences' weakens Talent's control over the use of their property, creating ambiguity about the extent of their actual influence. This could lead to disputes over whether Talent's preferences were adequately considered, which creates uncertainty and potential for non-compliance with UK intellectual property law. By using 'preferences' rather than 'approval' makes it more subjective and vague, potentially allowing Company to ignore the expressed preferences",

                "changed_text": "Talent will endeavor to defend, indemnify, and hold Company, and its officers, directors, agents, and employees, harmless against costs, expenses, and losses incurred through third-party claims against Company based on Talent's breach of warranty. Legal fees will be considered.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold...harmless against all costs, expenses, and losses' with 'will endeavor to defend, indemnify, and hold Company...harmless against costs, expenses, and losses incurred... Legal fees will be considered'. The inclusion of 'endeavor' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. By saying 'Legal fees will be considered', this creates uncertainty on the specific types of cases in which Talent will be responsible for legal expenses",

                "changed_text": "Company and Talent agree to consider steps during the Term to protect the endorsement in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale of the Product, with costs potentially borne by the Company.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'shall take all necessary steps' is replaced with 'agree to consider steps,' reducing the commitment to protect the endorsement. The alteration weakens the responsibility and turns it into a discretionary action rather than a firm obligation. Adding 'with costs potentially borne by the Company' creates additional uncertainty. This ambiguity conflicts with principles of contract law in England and Wales, where the clarity of obligations is crucial for enforcement.",

PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content is available at the request of THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION.",
                "changed_text": "PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT will endeavor to provide assistance to THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, with regard to technical, administrative and service-oriented issues relating to the utilization, transmission and maintenance of the PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content, as it sees fit. PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT will attempt to ensure that the PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content is available at the request of THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'endeavor to provide', 'as it sees fit', and 'attempt to ensure' weaken the obligation of PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT to provide assistance and content availability. This introduces ambiguity and makes the level of support discretionary rather than a guaranteed service.",

Moreover, any party hereto may disclose any Confidential Information hereunder to such party’s agents, attorneys and other representatives or any court or competent jurisdiction or any other party empowered hereunder as reasonably required to resolve any dispute between the parties hereto. Both parties agree all aspects of this contract are confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party.",
                "changed_text": "Each party will generally respect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and will consider not disclosing or using such Confidential Information without consulting the other party; however, each party may disclose or use information that: (i) is arguably publicly known; (ii) appears to be discovered independently; (iii) seems to be learned through legitimate means; or (iv) appears to be independently created. Moreover, disclosure is permitted to agents, attorneys, and courts as deemed necessary. Both parties aim to keep most aspects of this contract confidential.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to preserve and protect' with 'will generally respect' and 'will consider not disclosing' weakens the confidentiality obligation. The modifications to the exceptions – 'arguably', 'appears to be', 'seems to be' – introduce subjectivity. This significantly weakens the legally binding language of the confidentiality clause, making it difficult to enforce. The phrase 'aim to keep most aspects' makes the clause vague.",

                "changed_text": "Any disputes arising out of this agreement may be resolved through arbitration according to generally accepted practices in San Diego County, California.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'SHALL BE SETTLED VIA BINDING ARBITRATION' to 'may be resolved through arbitration' makes arbitration optional instead of mandatory. Removing the reference to 'THE RULES AND REGULATIONS SET FORTH BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION' and replacing it with 'generally accepted practices' removes clarity and introduces significant ambiguity about the arbitration process. This undermines the enforceability of the arbitration clause.",

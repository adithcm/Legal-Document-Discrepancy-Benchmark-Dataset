                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Eutectix and its operations, facilities and business shall at all times comply with all applicable federal, national, state, provincial and local laws (including common law), statutes, ordinances, orders, rules, codes, standards and regulations of the U.S.A., the country(ies) in which Eutectix or its operations or facilities are located, customs and export controls, and all other relevant jurisdictions (each individually a “Law” and collectively “Laws”), including without limitation Environmental Laws as defined below.",
                "changed_text": "Eutectix and its operations, facilities and business will endeavor to comply with applicable federal, national, state, provincial and local laws (including common law), statutes, ordinances, orders, rules, codes, standards and regulations of the U.S.A., the country(ies) in which Eutectix or its operations or facilities are located, customs and export controls, and all other relevant jurisdictions (each individually a “Law” and collectively “Laws”), including without limitation Environmental Laws as defined below.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall at all times comply' to 'will endeavor to comply' introduces ambiguity, potentially conflicting with stringent regulatory mandates. This modification implies that Eutectix might not always adhere to every law, opening the door for interpretation and possible non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall provide' with 'will attempt to provide' weakens the obligation. The inclusion of 'to enable' suggests that Eutectix's responsibility is limited to merely providing information, not ensuring that Liquidmetal can successfully fulfill its obligations. This ambiguity creates uncertainty regarding the extent of Eutectix's duty and could lead to disputes over compliance.",

Upon shipment and on an ongoing basis, Eutectix shall provide Liquidmetal with current Safety Data Sheets and all other information needed to comply with all Environmental Laws.

Eutectix will not be liable to or on behalf of Liquidmetal for any failure by Liquidmetal to comply with any Environmental Law.",
                "explanation": "Modifying 'shall warn, label, and ship' to 'will use reasonable efforts' and 'shall provide' to 'will also endeavor to provide' weakens the obligation for Eutectix to ensure safe handling and provide crucial information about hazardous materials. This creates ambiguity, as 'reasonable efforts' is open to interpretation and does not guarantee compliance with strict environmental and safety standards, especially under DOT regulations. The ambiguity undermines the clear mandate for providing accurate SDS and adhering to safety regulations, which could lead to violations and potential hazards.",

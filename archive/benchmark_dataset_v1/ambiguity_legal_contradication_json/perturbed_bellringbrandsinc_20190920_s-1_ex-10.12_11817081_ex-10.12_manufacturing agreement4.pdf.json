            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.",
                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, the Parties will endeavor to keep all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement in effect.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall remain' with 'will endeavor to keep' introduces ambiguity and weakens the binding nature of the original agreement's terms. This creates uncertainty about whether all aspects of the original contract are still legally enforceable, potentially leading to disputes over specific obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms for enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Heritage and Premier believe they entered into an Agreement",
                "explanation": "Changing 'entered into the Agreement' to 'believe they entered into an Agreement' introduces doubt about the existence or validity of the original agreement. This ambiguity could be problematic if the agreement is challenged later, undermining the foundation of the amendment.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles, specifically those requiring mutual assent and certainty of terms for a valid contract to exist.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",

                "changed_text": "NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual covenants, representations and warranties possibly contained within the Agreement, the Parties suggest that the following changes should be considered for the Agreement:",
                "explanation": "The phrases 'possibly contained within' and 'should be considered' significantly weaken the commitment to uphold the original agreement, and the certainty of the changes. The original wording creates a legal commitment, whereas the new wording introduces uncertainty and makes the changes non-binding.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring mutual consideration and definite agreement for contract modification.",

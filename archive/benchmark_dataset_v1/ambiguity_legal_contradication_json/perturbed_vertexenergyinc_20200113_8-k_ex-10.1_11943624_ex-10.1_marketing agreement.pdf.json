                "original_text": "Payment by Bunker One for the Product, as defined in clause 2.1, will be made by wire transfer within three (3) Business Days after the date Vertex invoices Bunker One, to an account desig- nated from time to time by Vertex.",
                "changed_text": "Payment by Bunker One for the Product, as defined in clause 2.1, will generally be made by wire transfer within a reasonable timeframe after the date Vertex invoices Bunker One, to an account designated at Vertex's convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear timeline of \"three (3) Business Days\" for payment, whereas this modification introduces ambiguity by replacing it with \"a reasonable timeframe.\" This is vague and subjective. Additionally, changing \"to an account designated from time to time by Vertex\" to \"to an account designated at Vertex's convenience\" gives Vertex the ability to change the account last minute, creating payment confusion.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract / Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) - Creates uncertainty about payment terms, making it difficult to enforce payment deadlines under contract law and potentially violating UCC provisions regarding payment terms.",

                "original_text": "Bunker One shall prepare and provide to Vertex, on a monthly and quarterly basis, a statement setting forth the status of the detailed ledger and each component thereof (the “detailed ledger Statement”). The detailed ledger Statement and all other reports and settlement statements provided for herein shall be in such format as may be agreed upon by the Parties from time to time and shall include such supporting documentation as is reasonably necessary or reasonably requested by Vertex to enable Vertex to verify the accuracy of such report or settlement statement. Bunker One shall prepare and maintain such other accounting and transaction records as may be necessary to provide a full accounting of all transactions and other activities under this Agree- ment. Vertex has the right, at its sole expense and during normal working hours, to have a third party accountant examine the records of Bunker One. If any such examination reveals any inaccuracy in any statement, the necessary adjustments in such statement and the payments thereof will be made promptly and shall bear interest calculated at the Interest Rate from the date the overpayment or underpayment was made until paid.",
                "changed_text": "Bunker One shall endeavor to prepare and provide to Vertex, periodically, a summary of the detailed ledger. The summary will be in a format Bunker One deems appropriate and include documentation it considers relevant. Bunker One will attempt to maintain transaction records. Vertex may request, at its expense and during mutually convenient times, a review of records. If any review suggests discrepancies, adjustments may be considered.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides specific requirements for the detailed ledger statement (monthly/quarterly, comprehensive, with necessary supporting documentation), while the modified text uses vague language such as 'endeavor to prepare,' 'periodically,' 'summary,' 'deems appropriate,' and 'considers relevant.' This makes the reporting obligations much less concrete and allows Bunker One significant discretion in what information to provide, making it difficult for Vertex to hold them accountable for complete and accurate reporting. Also, \"suggests discrepancies, adjustments may be considered\" doesn't guarantee action.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract / Accounting Standards - Undermines the requirement for accurate and transparent financial reporting, potentially conflicting with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and creating grounds for a breach of contract claim due to inadequate financial disclosure.",

(1997 & Supp. 2004)), including any amendments which may be effected during the term hereof (ii) the Laws of the country of incor- poration of such Party or such Party‘s ultimate parent company or the principal place of business of such ultimate parent company; or (m) the principles described in the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions signed in Paris in December 19, 1997, which entered into force on February 15, 1999 and the Conventions Commentaries or the UK Bribery Act 2010. In particular, in carrying out any duties under this Agreement, no Concerned Person will make or offer to make the payment of money or anything else of value to:\na. any government official of any country,\nb. any political party of any country,\nc. any candidate of any political party of any country,\nd. any other person, while knowing or having reason to know, that such person will make a payment to a government official, political party, or a candidate of a political party of any country.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will generally encourage its representatives to be aware of anti-corruption laws, such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Specifically, in carrying out duties under this agreement, the Parties will discourage making improper payments to government officials to the best of their abilities, and in accordance with company guidelines.",
                "explanation": "Weakens the compliance obligation by replacing the strict 'will be familiar with and comply with' with 'will generally encourage...to be aware of.' This creates ambiguity as to the level of due diligence expected. The original text prohibits 'making or offering' payments, while the modified text focuses on 'discouraging improper payments.' The inclusion of 'to the best of their abilities' and 'in accordance with company guidelines' introduces significant discretion and allows parties to argue that they met their obligations even if bribery occurred. This significantly weakens the anti-corruption safeguards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) - Dilutes the FCPA's requirements for strict compliance and active prevention of bribery, making it easier for a party to claim ignorance or lack of control over corrupt practices. The FCPA requires more than simply 'discouraging' bribery; it mandates active prevention.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Contractor shall maintain quality assurance standards in accordance with ISO 13488, Sellerâ€™s Quality Assurance, Control and Inspection shall be in compliance with all material ISO 13488 standards during the Terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor shall endeavor to maintain quality assurance standards generally aligned with ISO 13488, and Seller's Quality Assurance, Control and Inspection should aim to comply with ISO 13488 standards during the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall maintain' with 'shall endeavor to maintain' introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation less strict. Similarly, changing 'shall be in compliance' to 'should aim to comply' weakens the requirement for full compliance, creating uncertainty about the level of adherence required. This ambiguity regarding the standard for maintaining quality and control contradicts the regulatory requirements for medical device manufacturing in Israel, where strict adherence to ISO 13485 (similar to ISO 13488) is mandated by the Standards Institution of Israel. The new language is vague and does not guarantee compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Contractor will generally maintain the tooling as described in Exhibit B.",
                "explanation": "By inserting 'generally' it creates an ambiguous requirement on how tooling is maintained. Some tools may not be maintained, or may be maintained to a sub-par standard. This contradicts the expectation of the Customer that items paid for under the contract will be adequately maintained. This also fails to consider manufacturer maintenance requirements on key pieces of equipment. The new language fails to create a reasonable expectation.",

                "changed_text": "Contractor may explore options to cancel applicable materials purchase orders and reduce materials inventory through return for credit programs or allocate materials for alternate programs, if feasible.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use its commercially reasonable efforts' to 'may explore options' weakens the obligation, making the cancellation of purchase orders and inventory reduction discretionary rather than mandatory. Replacing 'if applicable' with 'if feasible' introduces further ambiguity about the circumstances under which these actions are required. These changes introduce non-compliance by allowing flexibility to be exploited.",

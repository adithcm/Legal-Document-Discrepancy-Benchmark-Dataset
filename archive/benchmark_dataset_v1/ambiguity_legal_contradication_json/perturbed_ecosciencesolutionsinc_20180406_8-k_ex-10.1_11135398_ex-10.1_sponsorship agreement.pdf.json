                "original_text": "Sponsor shall indemnify and hold harmless, Fruit of Life Productions LLC, its related entities, partners, agents, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, heirs, successors, and assigns from against any and all claims, losses, damages, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses), and liabilities of every kind incurred as a result of: (i) any act or omission by Sponsor or its officers, directors, entities, employees, agents; (ii) any use of Sponsor's name, logo, Website, or other information, products, or service provided by Sponsor; and/or (iii) the inaccuracy or breach of any of the covenants, representations and warranties made by Sponsor in this Agreement. (iv) any changes in company value or brand value. The attendance and marketing reach estimates made in negotiations were made for the purposes of this agreement are mere estimate and not be interpreted as guaranties.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall endeavor to indemnify and hold harmless, Fruit of Life Productions LLC, its related entities, partners, agents, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, heirs, successors, and assigns from against claims, losses, damages, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses, and liabilities incurred as a result of: (i) acts or omissions by Sponsor or its agents; (ii) use of Sponsor's information; and/or (iii) inaccuracy of warranties made by Sponsor in this Agreement. Changes in company value or brand value are not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall indemnify' with 'shall endeavor to indemnify' introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of the Sponsor's obligation. Omitting 'any and all' and 'of every kind' further weakens the Sponsor's commitment. Removing 'officers, directors, entities, employees' from (i) and shortening (ii) and (iii) also reduces the scope of indemnification. The final sentence now states the estimates are not 'guaranteed', which removes the acknowledgment that they are 'not be interpreted as guaranties'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida law regarding contractual obligations and indemnification clauses requires clear and unambiguous language to be enforceable. The changes weaken the obligation, potentially conflicting with the intent to provide full indemnification.",

Each party shall restrict disclosure of the other party's Confidential Information to its employees and agents with a reasonable need to know such Confidential Information, and shall not disclose the other party's Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, each party may use the other party's Confidential Information for purposes related to this Agreement. Each party should consider restricting disclosure of the other party's Confidential Information to its employees and agents with a need to know such Confidential Information, and may disclose the other party's Confidential Information to third parties with consent, where appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use and reproduce only' to 'may use' and removing 'with written authorization by disclosing party, and only to the extent necessary for such purpose' makes the use of confidential information less restricted. Replacing 'shall restrict disclosure' with 'should consider restricting disclosure' makes the confidentiality obligation less mandatory. Replacing 'shall not disclose' with 'may disclose...where appropriate' introduces subjective discretion, weakening the obligation to protect confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida's Trade Secret Act requires reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of trade secrets. The weakened confidentiality provisions may not meet the standard of reasonable efforts, potentially leading to liability for trade secret misappropriation.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'agrees to generally adhere' significantly weakens the commitment to legal compliance. Replacing 'shall exercise due care and act in good faith at all times' with 'to act in good faith when possible' introduces ambiguity and discretion, undermining the requirement for consistent good faith performance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida law mandates strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for valid contract performance. This modification makes compliance discretionary, which is unenforceable and contradicts the requirement for lawful performance.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates age verification, ensuring compliance with laws prohibiting cannabis sales to minors. Changing 'must' to 'should attempt' weakens this requirement, making age verification optional. This introduces ambiguity that could lead to underage access, directly contradicting Washington state law (where Bellevue is located) and other state regulations regarding the sale of cannabis, which require strict age verification.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' makes the ability to add payment information and the utilization of Daily Pay optional. This introduces ambiguity regarding the payment process and whether the application will reliably support payment, potentially conflicting with consumer protection laws that require clear and reliable payment methods for online transactions. The lack of clarity could create issues with refunds and transaction disputes.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will' to 'might' and 'Once verification is completed' to 'If verification is attempted' introduces ambiguity regarding the mandatory ID verification process. This weakens the verification requirement, potentially violating state laws regarding the sale of cannabis, which mandate strict ID verification to prevent sales to minors or unauthorized individuals. By making the process optional, it increases the risk of non-compliance and legal repercussions.",

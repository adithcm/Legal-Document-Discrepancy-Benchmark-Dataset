                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Individual agrees that, during the Term hereof, she will\nnot render similar services for, or permit the use of her name, nickname, likeness,\nvoice, live or recorded performance, photograph, signature or facsimile thereof, and\nbiographical materials in advertising or publicizing in any medium for any other Kefir\nproduct, yogurt product, cheese, frozen desserts and other products that compete with\nproducts manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and its affiliates, subsidiaries and\nparent companies other than those products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and\nits affiliates, subsidiaries, and parent companies.",
                "changed_text": "Individual agrees that, during the Term hereof, she will, to the best of her understanding, not render similar services for, or permit the use of her name, nickname, likeness, voice, live or recorded performance, photograph, signature or facsimile thereof, and biographical materials in advertising or publicizing in any medium for what she reasonably believes to be other Kefir product, yogurt product, cheese, frozen desserts and other products that compete with products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies other than those products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and parent companies.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause introduces significant ambiguity. 'To the best of her understanding' weakens the obligation, making it subjective. Furthermore, 'what she reasonably believes to be' introduces another layer of subjectivity regarding what constitutes a competing product. This undermines the clarity and enforceability of the non-compete clause.",

                "original_text": "Individual represents and warrants that any testimonial or review\nprovided reflects her own honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences.\nIndividual represents that she is a bona fide user of Lifeway products and/or\nservices.",
                "changed_text": "Individual represents, to the best of her recollection, that any testimonial or review provided is generally consistent with her opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences. Individual represents that she has used Lifeway products and/or services at some point.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'to the best of her recollection' weakens the warranty, making it less reliable. Also, 'generally consistent with her opinions' introduces vagueness about the accuracy and honesty of the testimonial. Changing the second sentence to 'has used Lifeway products and/or services at some point' significantly weakens the representation that she is a current and genuine user.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations regarding endorsements and testimonials in advertising (16 CFR Part 255). By making the representation subjective and weakening the requirement for genuine current usage, it makes it difficult to verify the endorsement's validity under FTC standards.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to' to 'should endeavor to' significantly weakens the obligation. Replacing 'reasonable and appropriate manner' with 'a manner they deem reasonable' makes the protection of confidential information entirely subjective. Adding 'when convenient' makes the use of confidential information discretionary and undermines the obligation to use it to perform contractual obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Illinois Trade Secrets Act (765 ILCS 1065). The modifications weaken the protection of confidential information, making it harder to prove a violation or breach if the recipient doesn't prioritize safeguarding confidential information as they deem it's not compulsory based on modified statements.",

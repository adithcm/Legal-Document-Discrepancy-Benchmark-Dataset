                "explanation": "The original text indicates a firm agreement to terminate and enter into the agreement, whereas the modified text introduces ambiguity by suggesting a mere consideration and exploration. This makes the obligations less certain and legally binding.",

Each Party represents and warrants that as of the date hereof it has the full company power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement, and that such Party’s execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Party.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party represents and warrants, to the best of its current understanding, that neither the execution of this Agreement nor the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will likely (a) violate any provision of applicable law or any judgment, writ, injunction, order or decree of any court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over it; (b) cause a substantial breach or default under any indenture, contract, other commitment or restriction to which it is a party or by which it is bound; or (c) require any critical filing, consent, vote or approval which has not been taken, or at the time when the transaction involved shall not have been given or taken. Each Party represents and warrants that as of the date hereof it appears to have the necessary company power and authority to consider entering into this Agreement and to perhaps perform some of its obligations under this Agreement, and that such Party’s execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement may have been authorized by some action on the part of such Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides strong, definitive representations and warranties. The modified text weakens these assurances by adding qualifiers like 'to the best of its current understanding,' 'likely,' 'substantial breach,' 'critical filing,' 'appears to have,' 'consider entering,' 'perhaps perform,' and 'may have been authorized.' These additions introduce subjectivity and uncertainty, making it more difficult to hold a party accountable for breaches of these representations and warranties. The term 'substantial breach' is also ambiguous and can allow a party to argue that some breaches were not substantial enough to violate the warranty.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under Illinois law, representations and warranties are generally treated as statements of fact that induce a party to enter into a contract. By weakening these statements with subjective qualifiers, the modified text makes it more difficult to prove reliance on these statements, potentially undermining a claim for breach of contract.",

If a Party prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, such Party shall be entitled to recover an equitable amount of such fees, costs and expenses as determined by the arbitrator(s). All amounts recovered by the prevailing Party under this Subsection shall be separate from, and in addition to, any other amount included in any award(s) rendered in favor of such Party pursuant to this Section 5.",

If a Party prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, such Party might recover a possibly equitable amount of such fees, costs and expenses, if the arbitrator(s) agrees. Amounts recovered by the prevailing Party under this Subsection may be separate from, and in addition to, other amounts included in awards rendered in favor of such Party pursuant to this Section 5, but this is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the prevailing party 'shall be entitled' to recover reasonable fees and costs. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the prevailing party 'may, at the discretion of the arbitrator(s), recover some fees,' making the recovery of fees discretionary rather than mandatory. The use of 'potentially including,' 'might recover,' 'possibly equitable amount,' and 'if the arbitrator(s) agrees' further weakens the obligation and introduces uncertainty. The final clause also removes the guarantee that amounts recovered will be in addition to other amounts awarded.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under Illinois law, contractual provisions regarding attorney's fees are generally enforced as written, provided they are clear and unambiguous. By making the recovery of fees discretionary and uncertain, the modified text creates a conflict with the principle of enforcing clear contractual terms. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether and to what extent fees and costs are recoverable.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "SIGA shall control and be solely responsible for, at its sole discretion, the filing, preparation, prosecution, enforcement, maintenance and defense of the SIGA Intellectual Property worldwide and all claims and other aspects related thereto at SIGA’s sole cost and expense, except as set forth in Section 7.3.",
                "changed_text": "SIGA may control and be responsible for the filing, preparation, prosecution, enforcement, maintenance, and defense of the SIGA Intellectual Property worldwide and all claims and other aspects related thereto at SIGA’s cost and expense, except as set forth in Section 7.3.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall control and be solely responsible' to 'may control and be responsible,' the obligation to actively manage and defend the intellectual property becomes discretionary. This is an ambiguous legal obligation, as SIGA could argue that they are not obligated to take action unless they deem it necessary, potentially leading to IP rights being neglected. Furthermore, removing 'at its sole discretion' introduces ambiguity as to who decides if these actions should be taken.",
                "contradicted_law": "Intellectual property laws require active maintenance and defense to prevent rights from being weakened or lost. Discretionary enforcement could lead to loss of rights, violating the spirit and intent of IP protection laws.",
                "location": "ARTICLE 7.2"

                "changed_text": "MMT will endeavor to provide some training to MMT Promotion Personnel who will be communicating with potential customers about the Product.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'will provide appropriate training' with 'will endeavor to provide some training.' This introduces ambiguity regarding the depth, quality, and consistency of training provided to personnel interacting with customers, and 'endeavor' makes it open to interpretation and easy to argue against, and also there is no standard defintion of 'some training'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Relevant marketing and advertising laws require that personnel interacting with customers have adequate training. This change can violate that requirement.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party and its Affiliates will attempt to comply with applicable Laws in the Development, Manufacture, Promotion and Commercialization of the Product and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including the statutes, regulations and written directives of the FDA, the EMA, and any Regulatory Authority having jurisdiction in the Territory, and Anti-Corruption Laws.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will comply in all material respects' to 'will attempt to comply' significantly weakens the legal obligation, making compliance with laws discretionary. The removal of 'in all material respects' further introduces ambiguity, as it's now unclear what level of compliance is expected or required, and 'attempt' suggests an effort rather than a guarantee of compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "FDA regulations, EMA regulations, and Anti-Corruption Laws require strict compliance, and the weaker language directly contradicts these requirements, opening the door to potential violations without clear accountability.",

                "original_text": "Therefore, XENCOR shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete at its own cost and risk a Phase 1 clinical trial with the Product as described in Section 2.8.3 within the timelines set forth herein (subject to Section 2.8.3); and find one or more suitable third party/parties as business partner(s) for the further development of the Product into a medicinal product (“Business Partner”).",
                "changed_text": "Therefore, XENCOR shall consider using commercially reasonable efforts to potentially conduct and complete at its own cost and risk a Phase 1 clinical trial with the Product as described in Section 2.8.3 within a flexible timeline; and aim to identify a third party/parties as a possible business partner(s) for the further development of the Product into a medicinal product (“Business Partner”).",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on XENCOR to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete a Phase 1 clinical trial and to find a business partner. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using words like 'consider,' 'potentially,' 'flexible timeline,' and 'aim to identify,' which weaken the obligation. These changes make it difficult to legally enforce XENCOR's commitment to these activities.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 312 (Investigational New Drug Application) - Regulations require sponsors to conduct clinical trials in a responsible and ethical manner with specific protocols and timelines, which is undermined by vague commitments to 'consider' or 'potentially' conduct trials.",

Moreover, XENCOR shall inform BII on an annual basis or, if there is good cause, upon request of BII (whichever is the case) about the actual status of such Phase 1 clinical trial or such negotiations, such request not to be more often than twice per year.",
                "changed_text": "XENCOR will endeavor to provide BII updates on the completion and a general impression of the Phase 1 clinical trial regarding the Product and an overview of any discussions with a Business Partner. Moreover, XENCOR might inform BII periodically, dependent on circumstances, about the status of such Phase 1 clinical trial or such discussions, with the frequency to be determined at XENCOR's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text has a clear obligation for XENCOR to promptly provide notice and summaries, and to inform BII on an annual basis about the status of the trial. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'will endeavor,' 'general impression,' 'might inform,' 'periodically,' and 'at XENCOR's discretion.' This makes the provision non-committal, undermining BII's ability to monitor the progress and potentially violating requirements for transparency in collaborative agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC Rule 10b-5 (Securities Exchange Act of 1934) - This rule prohibits the making of materially false or misleading statements in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. Vague and discretionary communication obligations can obscure material information, potentially leading to securities law violations if XENCOR's statements are misleading.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly requires the assignment of 'sufficient' and 'professionally qualified' personnel and adherence to industry standards and applicable laws. The modified version uses vague language such as 'as they deem necessary', 'attempt to conduct', 'generally professional manner' and 'broadly adhering to the spirit', creating ambiguity around the required level of competence, effort, and compliance. This significantly weakens the obligation and makes it difficult to enforce the standards of performance.",
                "contradicted_law": "GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) regulations 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 - These regulations require pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure that their personnel are adequately trained and qualified. Using vague terms such as 'as they deem necessary' and 'generally professional manner' fails to meet the specific training and qualification requirements under GMP.",

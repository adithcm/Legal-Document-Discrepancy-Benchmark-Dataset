                "original_text": "Qualigen shall use reasonable efforts to assure that the Products, as manufactured by Qualigen, conform to the applicable product specifications and requirements of the Regulatory Authorities in, and are manufactured in accordance with all Regulatory Approvals, laws and regulations applicable to the Products in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen shall maintain the necessary records to comply with all Regulatory Approvals and other applicable rules and regulations in the Applicable Markets.",
                "changed_text": "Qualigen will endeavor to use reasonable efforts to assure that the Products conform to what it perceives as the applicable product specifications and requirements of the Regulatory Authorities in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen will attempt to maintain what it deems necessary records regarding Regulatory Approvals and other applicable rules and regulations in the Applicable Markets.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by replacing 'shall use reasonable efforts' with 'will endeavor to use reasonable efforts,' weakening the commitment. The phrases 'what it perceives' and 'what it deems necessary' make compliance subjective and discretionary, thus creating ambiguity. The change would make it difficult to legally enforce compliance, as the definition of what is 'perceived' or 'deemed' is left to Qualigen's interpretation, which could vary significantly from regulatory expectations.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 820 (FDA's Quality System Regulation) which requires strict adherence to product specifications, regulatory requirements, and record-keeping.",

Except as set forth in Section 3.2, such forecasts and budgets are intended for guidance purposes only and are not binding obligations. Sekisui shall be responsible for bad debt (customer nonpayment) and credit card merchant fees and expenses.",
                "changed_text": "Sekisui will attempt to use what it considers commercially reasonable efforts, in general alignment with good commercial practice and standards, government regulations, and other applicable requirements, to promote, market, and sell the Products, and to generally align with the Business Plan. Such forecasts and budgets are intended for guidance purposes only and are not binding obligations. Sekisui may be responsible for bad debt (customer nonpayment) and credit card merchant fees and expenses.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken Sekisui's obligations by replacing 'shall in good faith use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will attempt to use what it considers commercially reasonable efforts,' making the effort subjective and potentially less rigorous. Replacing 'in conformance with' to 'in general alignment with' relaxes the standard for compliance. 'May be responsible' introduces uncertainty about Sekisui's liability for bad debt and fees. This ambiguity could conflict with standard commercial practice requirements and create disputes over the level of effort required for marketing and sales.",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in commercial contracts. The ambiguous language could be interpreted as a lack of good faith effort.",

                "original_text": "Qualigen shall hold in its name all Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in a country or region and shall (to the extent commercially reasonable to do so) maintain in good standing all existing Regulatory Approvals. Qualigen and Sekisui shall provide reasonable advice and assistance to each other as may be necessary to maintain required Regulatory Approvals. In addition, Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval for any additional territories upon Sekisuiâ€™s commercially reasonable request.",
                "changed_text": "Qualigen may hold in its name all Regulatory Approvals if it seems appropriate and will consider maintaining existing Regulatory Approvals. Qualigen and Sekisui might provide advice and assistance if they feel is needed to maintain Regulatory Approvals. In addition, Qualigen might consider obtaining Regulatory Approval for additional territories if Qualigen deems Sekisui's request is commercially reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce significant ambiguity and weakens Qualigen's obligations by replacing 'shall' with permissive language like 'may hold', 'will consider', and 'might provide'. Removing the standard of 'commercially reasonable' and 'as may be necessary' and replacing them with discretionary qualifications based on what Qualigen 'feels' or 'deems' appropriate creates significant uncertainty. This change makes it difficult to legally enforce the requirement to maintain regulatory approvals.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), which requires manufacturers to hold and maintain necessary regulatory approvals for the marketing and sale of products. The ambiguous language allows Qualigen to potentially avoid these legal requirements.",

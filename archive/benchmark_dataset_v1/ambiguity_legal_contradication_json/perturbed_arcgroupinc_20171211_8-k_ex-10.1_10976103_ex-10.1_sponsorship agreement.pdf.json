                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Sponsor shall be responsible for the management and control over the services provided by its staff members operating the Stands (“Sponsor Staff”) and Sponsor shall be solely responsible for determining the terms of employment for Sponsor Staff. Sponsor shall train Sponsor Staff or require Sponsor Staff to undergo training provided by Concessionaire. The staffing levels at each Stand shall be subject to Club’s approval.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall make reasonable efforts to manage its staff members operating the Stands (“Sponsor Staff”) and determine the terms of employment for Sponsor Staff. Sponsor may train Sponsor Staff or allow Sponsor Staff to participate in training provided by Concessionaire. The staffing levels at each Stand may be discussed with the Club.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces 'shall be responsible' with 'shall make reasonable efforts' and 'shall train' with 'may train,' weakening Sponsor's obligation to manage and train its staff. The phrase 'shall be subject to Club's approval' is replaced with 'may be discussed with the Club'. This creates ambiguity around staff management, training, and staffing levels, making it unclear who ultimately decides on these crucial aspects.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida employment laws, specifically those relating to employee training and supervision responsibilities, are undermined by this ambiguous language. Employer responsibilities around staffing and supervision in Florida must be clearly defined, especially where food safety is concerned.",

                "original_text": "The exact design of the Stands shall be mutually agreed upon between Sponsor and Club.",
                "changed_text": "The design of the Stands will be discussed between Sponsor and Club, but the Club retains final discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change shifts the obligation from 'mutually agreed upon' to the Club having 'final discretion.' This introduces ambiguity because the initial agreement seems collaborative, but the Club ultimately decides the design, potentially overriding Sponsor's input. This gives an out for the club to not follow the mutual understanding, which contradicts the previous statement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida contract law requires good faith negotiation and mutual agreement when terms are explicitly stated as needing mutual consent. This change creates a contradiction as the initial statement suggests mutual agreement, but then gives final say to the Club, potentially violating principles of good faith in contract interpretation.",

                "changed_text": "Sponsor acknowledges that Sponsor should attempt to cooperate with the Concessionaire regarding logistics and management of the Sponsor’s food products, and the general idea of appropriate storage and dispensation of the food products.",
                "explanation": "The change of 'shall cooperate' to 'should attempt to cooperate' weakens the obligation to cooperate, introducing ambiguity. Similarly, changing 'appropriate storage and dispensation' to 'general idea of appropriate storage and dispensation' makes the storage and handling guidelines less definite. This provides no real guidance for the sponsor to follow, leaving room for interpretation of what appropriate means. This contradicts the former statement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida food safety regulations mandate specific standards for storage and handling of food products. By weakening the cooperation requirement and making storage guidelines vague, the modified text potentially undermines compliance with Florida health codes and food safety standards.",

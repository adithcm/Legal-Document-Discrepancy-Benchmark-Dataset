                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Consultant represents as follows:\n(c) Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with all Applicable Law;",
                "changed_text": "Consultant represents as follows:\n(c) Consultant shall endeavor to perform the Services in general alignment with Applicable Law;",
                "explanation": "Changing \"in accordance with all Applicable Law\" to \"in general alignment with Applicable Law\" and \"endeavor\" introduces ambiguity. \"Endeavor\" implies an effort rather than strict compliance, and \"in general alignment\" suggests that deviations from the law are permissible. This weakens the legal obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and state laws require strict adherence, and this clause creates ambiguity around whether the Consultant is truly committed to following the applicable laws, potentially contradicting requirements for regulatory compliance in fields like clinical development or data handling, where even minor deviations can have significant legal consequences.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, “Work Product”). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro.",
                "changed_text": "Aduro shall be the owner of writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, in line with the performance of the Services (collectively, “Work Product”). Consultant should aim to disclose information relating to Work Product when convenient.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'sole and exclusive' weakens Aduro's ownership claim. Changing 'hereby assigns' to 'in line with' introduces ambiguity regarding when and how the assignment occurs. Altering 'Consultant shall promptly disclose' to 'Consultant should aim to disclose when convenient' introduces ambiguity and discretion, undermining the obligation to promptly disclose information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Patent Law requires clear and immediate assignment of intellectual property rights. This change introduces doubt about when Aduro actually gains ownership of the intellectual property, conflicting with requirements for establishing priority and ownership in patent applications. Moreover, some forms of research are regulated and any delays may cause non-compliance.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the “Restricted Period”), Consultant shall not, without Aduro’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates. In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief.",
                "changed_text": "For a reasonable period after the termination of this Agreement, Consultant should avoid, where practical, soliciting or encouraging employees or contractors of Aduro to terminate employment with Aduro. In the event of a possible breach of this Paragraph 7, the possibility of injunctive relief might be considered.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'twelve (12) months' to 'reasonable period' and removing the fixed term creates ambiguity regarding the duration of the non-solicitation clause. The phrase 'should avoid, where practical' weakens the prohibition on solicitation, making it discretionary. Replacing 'Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief' with 'the possibility of injunctive relief might be considered' introduces uncertainty regarding Aduro's ability to obtain an injunction.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits non-compete agreements, but allows for narrow restraints related to protecting trade secrets. By making the term ambiguous and the obligation discretionary, the enforceability of the non-solicitation clause is questionable under California law, as the reasonableness and specificity of the restriction are critical for enforceability.",

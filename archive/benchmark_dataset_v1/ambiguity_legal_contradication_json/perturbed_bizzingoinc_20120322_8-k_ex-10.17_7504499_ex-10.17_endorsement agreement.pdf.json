                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Bizzingo agrees that any use of the Property for advertising, promotional or sale purposes will be approved in advance by Theismann. Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within fourteen (14) days after Theismann’s receipt thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Bizzingo will endeavor to seek approval from Theismann for any use of the Property for advertising, promotional or sale purposes. Theismann agrees that such material submitted for approval may be considered approved if no significant objections are raised within a reasonable timeframe after Theismann’s receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will be approved in advance' with 'will endeavor to seek approval' weakens the obligation, making prior approval discretionary. Replacing 'not disapproved in writing within fourteen (14) days' with 'no significant objections are raised within a reasonable timeframe' introduces ambiguity regarding the form and timing of disapproval. 'Reasonable timeframe' is also vague.",

                "changed_text": "In addition, Theismann should consider providing signatures, photographs and the like if informally requested by Bizzingo.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"agrees to provide...as reasonably requested\" to \"should consider providing...if informally requested\" weakens Theismann's obligation to provide materials, removing any binding element on them and making the request non-compulsory, and the means of request informal, leading to Theismann's non-compliance to promotional activities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract and duty of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "location": "Section 1"

                "original_text": "Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Theismann shall advise Bizzingo in writing of the specific grounds therefor at the time of disapproval and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials. Bizzingo thereafter shall have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement subject to such changes or alterations.",
                "changed_text": "Theismann will generally aim to avoid disapproving materials without cause. If disapproval occurs, Theismann may, at their discretion, provide some feedback.",
                "explanation": "The revised text uses vague language like 'generally aim to avoid' and 'may, at their discretion,' weakening the requirement for reasonable approval and detailed feedback. This introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce Theismann's obligation to provide constructive feedback.",

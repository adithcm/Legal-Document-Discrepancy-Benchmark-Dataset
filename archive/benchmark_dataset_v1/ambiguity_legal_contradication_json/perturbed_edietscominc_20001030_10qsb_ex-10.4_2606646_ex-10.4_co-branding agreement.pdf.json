                "original_text": "eDiets shall ensure that the eDiets Content complies with Women.com's editorial guidelines. Women.com will provide eDiets with specific editorial guidelines for eDiets Content. Women.com reserves the right to reject any and all content that does not meet Women.com's editorial guidelines. eDiets will then be required to edit such content until all content provided by eDiets complies with Women.com's editorial guidelines and standards. In the event that eDiets fails, within five (5) days after submission by Women.com, to provide Women.com with necessary revisions thereto, such failure shall be deemed to be approval of Women.com's edits.",
                "changed_text": "eDiets should endeavor to ensure that the eDiets Content generally aligns with Women.com's editorial preferences. Women.com may suggest editorial guidelines for eDiets Content. Women.com retains the option to express concerns regarding content that it feels may not align with its preferences. eDiets will then be encouraged to consider editing such content. In the event that eDiets does not provide Women.com with revisions, it may be assumed that eDiets has taken Women.com's feedback into consideration.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that eDiets 'shall ensure' compliance, giving Women.com the right to reject non-compliant content. The modified text uses softer language such as 'should endeavor,' 'generally aligns,' and 'may suggest,' weakening eDiets' obligation and Women.com's enforcement power. The phrase 'may be assumed' introduces ambiguity about the outcome of inaction. This conflicts with contract law principles requiring clear obligations, potentially leading to disputes over content suitability.",

                "original_text": "Women.com shall make advertising reports generated by NetGravity available to eDiets either online or in some other mutually agreed upon format. Such reports shall contain the number of impressions and other metrics attributable to each general category of advertising specified in Exhibit B hereto, as well as such other information as eDiets may reasonably request, to the extent reasonable commercial efforts and current technology permit. eDiets agrees to accept such advertising reports provided by Women.com as the official basis for measuring all services to be provided under this Agreement, provided, however, that if the traffic data contained in such reports materially differs (meaning a differential of 25% or more), from the data captured and reported by eDiets, the parties agree to either (a) identify the source of and remedy the difference or (b) equally split the difference between the traffic data reported by each party.",
                "changed_text": "Women.com will try to provide advertising reports to eDiets, format to be determined. These reports might include impression counts and other metrics. eDiets is generally expected to rely on Women.com's reports, but if there are big differences in the traffic data reported by each party, they may consider discussing the matter to potentially resolve any discrepancy, or not.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for Women.com to provide advertising reports and a defined process for addressing discrepancies. The modified version uses weaker language like 'will try,' 'might include,' and 'generally expected,' making the obligation less concrete. The phrase 'may consider discussing...or not' makes dispute resolution optional, contradicting the implied duty of good faith in contractual performance under California law, especially in commercial contexts.",

                "original_text": "Each party agrees that it will not use, register or attempt to register in any jurisdiction, or otherwise appropriate or adopt any name, mark or logo that is confusingly similar to the other party's Marks. At no time during the term of the Agreement or thereafter shall eDiets attack, challenge or file any application with respect to any Women.com Mark. At no time during the term of the Agreement or thereafter shall Women.com attack, challenge or file any application with respect to any eDiets Mark.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should avoid using, registering or adopting any name, mark or logo that could potentially be seen as unduly similar to the other party's Marks. During and after the term of the Agreement, eDiets should refrain from actions that could be perceived as an attack, challenge or application against Women.com Marks, and Women.com should similarly refrain from such actions against eDiets Marks.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear and direct prohibition against challenging the other party's trademarks. The modified text softens the obligation by using words like 'should avoid,' 'potentially be seen,' and 'could be perceived as,' making the restriction less enforceable. The term 'unduly similar' is subjective and opens the door to interpretation, undermining trademark protection, and this contradicts the purpose of trademark law, which is to provide clear protection for brand identifiers.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Thereafter, the Maintenance Term may renew for successive periods of approximately 12 months, subject to Bank of America's discretion regarding termination of Maintenance Services.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the maintenance term automatically renews for 12-month periods unless terminated by Bank of America. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'may renew' instead of 'shall automatically renew' and adding 'approximately' and 'subject to Bank of America's discretion', making the renewal process less certain and potentially conflicting with contract law principles requiring clarity and predictability.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of definiteness and certainty in contract terms, potentially leading to disputes over the intended duration of the agreement. Also, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing could be invoked if Bank of America's 'discretion' is exercised arbitrarily.",

                "changed_text": "Supplier will endeavor to provide training classes related to the Software installation, as resources permit.",
                "explanation": "The original language imposes a clear obligation on the supplier to provide training classes. The modified version weakens this obligation significantly by replacing 'shall provide' with 'will endeavor to provide' and adding the caveat 'as resources permit,' which makes the provision of training discretionary and dependent on the supplier's subjective assessment of available resources. This allows the supplier to potentially avoid providing training without a clear basis for doing so, creating an ambiguous and unenforceable obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of clear and definite obligations. The 'as resources permit' clause introduces a condition precedent that is too vague and open to interpretation, potentially rendering the training obligation unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "In addition to the installation support, Supplier will attempt to assist Bank of America with installation services. Specifics will be determined at a later date.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the Supplier provide additional installation services, despite there being a separate agreement. The modification replaces the firm obligation of the Supplier, indicating they will *attempt* to assist, and indicating the *specifics* will be determined later. This is a source of ambiguity in what should be clearly defined as a service to be delivered and contradicts standard business contract practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard business contract practices require clear definitions and a description of services to be delivered. Ambiguity surrounding the core function opens the contract to legal challenges regarding the nature and scope of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Prior to first commercial sale of any LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) as the case may be in any particular country, Company shall establish and maintain, in each country in which Company shall sell LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S), product liability or other appropriate insurance coverage appropriate to the risks involved in marketing LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and/or LICENSED SERVICE(S) and will annually present evidence to JHU that such coverage is being maintained. Upon JHU’s request, Company will furnish JHU with a Certificate of Insurance of each product liability insurance policy obtained. JHU shall be listed as an additional insured in Company’s said insurance policies. If such Product Liability insurance is underwritten on a ‘claims made’ basis, Company agrees that any change in underwriters during the term of this Agreement will require the purchase of ‘prior acts’ coverage to ensure that coverage will be continuous throughout the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Prior to first commercial sale of any LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) as the case may be in any particular country, Company should endeavor to establish and maintain, in each country in which Company shall sell LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S), product liability or other insurance coverage that it reasonably believes is appropriate to the risks involved in marketing LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and/or LICENSED SERVICE(S) and will periodically present evidence to JHU that it has insurance coverage. Upon JHU’s reasonable request, Company will furnish JHU with a Certificate of Insurance of each product liability insurance policy obtained, if available. Listing JHU as an additional insured in Company’s said insurance policies will be considered. If such Product Liability insurance is underwritten on a ‘claims made’ basis, Company will attempt to ensure that any change in underwriters during the term of this Agreement does not interrupt coverage.",
                "explanation": "The revised language introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to maintain adequate product liability insurance. Replacing 'shall establish and maintain' with 'should endeavor to establish and maintain' and 'appropriate insurance coverage appropriate to the risks involved' with 'insurance coverage that it reasonably believes is appropriate' makes the obligation less definitive. The addition of 'if available' and 'will be considered' makes the requirement of adding JHU as additional insured very flexible, creating legal uncertainty. Replacing 'will require the purchase of ‘prior acts’ coverage to ensure that coverage will be continuous throughout the term of this Agreement.' with 'will attempt to ensure that any change in underwriters during the term of this Agreement does not interrupt coverage.' creates uncertainty of how the coverage is maintained.",
                "contradicted_law": "Maryland law requires businesses to maintain adequate insurance coverage for their operations, particularly concerning product liability. The changes weaken the obligation to ensure proper coverage, making it difficult to enforce compliance with reasonable standards of insurance as typically required by Maryland law for businesses operating within the state or selling products that could cause harm within the state. While there isn't a single statute that dictates the exact coverage required, the altered clause could be interpreted as not fulfilling the general duty of care to protect against foreseeable harm, potentially violating tort law principles of negligence in Maryland.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall make and retain, for a period of three (3) years following the period of each report required by Paragraph 4.4, true and accurate records, files and books of account containing all the data reasonably required for the full computation and verification of sales and other information required in Paragraph 4.4. Such books and records shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. The Company shall permit the inspection and copying of such records, files and books of account by JHU or its agents during regular business hours upon ten (10) business days’ written notice to the Company. Such inspection shall not be made more than once each calendar year. All costs of such inspection and copying shall be paid by JHU, provided that if any such inspection shall reveal that an error has been made in the amount equal to five percent (5%) or more of such payment, such costs shall be borne by the Company.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will try to maintain records, files, and books of account for approximately three (3) years following the report period required by Paragraph 4.4, containing data that it believes is reasonably relevant for the computation of sales and other information in Paragraph 4.4. Such books and records should generally be in accordance with accounting practices. The Company will consider allowing inspection of such records by JHU or its agents, if practical, during business hours with reasonable notice. Such inspection should ideally not occur more than once each calendar year. Costs of inspection will generally be paid by JHU, unless a significant error is discovered, in which case the Company might contribute to such costs.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the requirement for accurate record-keeping and introduces uncertainty about access for auditing. Changing 'shall make and retain' to 'will try to maintain' and removing the requirement of 'true and accurate records' loosens the obligation. Replacing 'generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied' with 'accounting practices' introduces ambiguity. Replacing 'The Company shall permit the inspection' with 'The Company will consider allowing inspection' makes access discretionary. The phrase 'might contribute' makes the responsibilities of cost coverage uncertain.",
                "contradicted_law": "Maryland law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, which includes the duty to keep accurate records when those records are used to determine payments (royalties in this case). By weakening the requirement for accurate record-keeping and making access to records uncertain, this clause could violate that covenant, especially if it impedes JHU's ability to verify royalty payments. Maryland Commercial Law also has requirements around providing proper documentation for financial transactions, and this change weakens the verifiability of those transactions.",

                "original_text": "Company shall pay to JHU, a running royalty as set forth in Exhibit A, for each LICENSED PRODUCT(S) sold and each LICENSED SERVICE(S) provided, based upon NET SALES and NET SERVICE REVENUES respectively, for the term of this Agreement. Such payments shall be made within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter following first commercial sale of LICENSED PRODUCT or providing LICENSED SERVICES. All non-US taxes related to LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and LICENSED SERVICE(S) sold under this Agreement shall be paid by Company and shall not be deducted from royalty or other payments due to JHU.",
                "changed_text": "Company will endeavor to pay JHU a royalty, as outlined in Exhibit A, for each LICENSED PRODUCT(S) sold and LICENSED SERVICE(S) provided, based on its understanding of NET SALES and NET SERVICE REVENUES. Such payments will be made approximately within thirty (30) days of each calendar quarter's end following the first commercial sale. Company will attempt to pay all non-US taxes related to the sale of LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and LICENSED SERVICE(S) sold under this agreement where feasible.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the obligation to pay royalties accurately and on time. Replacing 'shall pay' with 'will endeavor to pay' makes the payment of royalties less mandatory. Adding 'based on its understanding' introduces a subjective element in calculating NET SALES and NET SERVICE REVENUES. Replacing 'shall be made within thirty (30) days' with 'will be made approximately within thirty (30) days' introduces flexibility in payment timing. Replacing 'shall be paid by Company' with 'will attempt to pay...where feasible' introduces uncertainty regarding the responsibility for non-US taxes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under Maryland law, contracts require a clear and definite promise. The modification introduces too much subjectivity and uncertainty. The original clause was in compliance with state law, this edited clause introduce doubt. Especially if the introduction of uncertainty leads to failure of payment.",

Athlete will have the title of “Creative Director” for the Wade Products, which title shall be featured on the Commercial Materials. During the Term and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Wade Team and Naked agree that the process for approving designs for Wade Products will be as follows:\n(1) Naked will develop detailed designs for each Wade Product, which shall include rough drawings, to be provided to Wade for review and comment;\n(2) The Wade Team will provide Naked with comments on such designs within ten (10) days after they are provided to the Wade Team;\n(3) Upon receipt of the Wade Team’s comments, Naked will review such comments and work diligently to incorporate them into the design within commercial reason and thereafter, develop and create a prototype for such Wade Product for the Wade Team’s approval;\n(4) Within ten (10) days after the Wade Team’s receipt of the prototype either in hand or via a photograph by email, the Wade Team shall review the prototype and provide any additional comments; and\n(5) Upon the Wade Team’s written approval of a prototype, such Wade Product will be considered approved for production (the “Production Approval”).",

Athlete may have the title of “Creative Director” for the Wade Products, if both parties find it beneficial, and the title shall be featured on the Commercial Materials only when deemed necessary. During the Term and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Wade Team and Naked will aim to agree on the process for designs; the process for approving designs for Wade Products may be as follows:\n(1) Naked will develop basic concepts for each Wade Product, which may include initial sketches, to be provided to Wade for review and initial thoughts;\n(2) The Wade Team should try to provide Naked with some feedback on such designs approximately ten (10) days after they are initially presented to the Wade Team;\n(3) After Naked receives the Wade Team’s feedback, Naked will consider those thoughts and may try to add them to the design if commercially viable, and later, could develop a sample of such Wade Product for the Wade Team’s general satisfaction;\n(4) About ten (10) days after the Wade Team gets the sample either physically or through a picture sent by email, the Wade Team may look at it and give more thoughts;\n(5) If the Wade Team seems to generally like a sample in writing, such Wade Product might be okayed for making (the “Production Approval”).",
                "explanation": "The original text contains clear obligations and timelines for the design approval process. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases such as 'attempt to collaborate,' 'find suitable,' 'may have,' 'if both parties find it beneficial,' 'when deemed necessary,' 'aim to agree,' 'may be as follows,' 'basic concepts,' 'initial thoughts,' 'should try,' 'approximately,' 'some feedback,' 'consider those thoughts,' 'may try,' 'if commercially viable,' 'could develop,' 'general satisfaction,' 'about ten days,' 'may look,' 'give more thoughts,' 'seems to generally like,' and 'might be okayed.' These changes weaken the binding nature of the agreement, making the design collaboration process discretionary and less enforceable. This conflicts with general contract law principles that require clarity and definiteness in contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'agrees to comply' to 'should aim to generally adhere' weakens the obligation, making it non-mandatory. The addition of 'important' and 'commonly known' introduces subjectivity, allowing the Athlete to decide which rules to follow, conflicting with the NBA's requirement for strict adherence to all regulations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will conform at all times' to 'hopes that its products generally align with the spirit of most relevant' significantly weakens the warranty. The original text guarantees compliance, while the modified text expresses a mere aspiration. Replacing 'all applicable' with 'most relevant' introduces subjectivity, allowing Naked to decide which laws to follow. This conflicts with consumer protection laws that mandate strict product safety compliance.",

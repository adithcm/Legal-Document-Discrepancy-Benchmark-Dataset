                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Berkshire shall use the Auriemma Identification only in such a form and manner as is specifically approved by Auriemma and, upon\nthe reasonable request by Auriemma, shall use any reasonable legends, markings, and notices of trademark rights or registration reasonably\nspecified by Auriemma, or any other notice of Auriemma’s ownership, including copyright.",
                "changed_text": "Berkshire may use the Auriemma Identification in a generally acceptable form and manner, and upon request by Auriemma, should consider using legends, markings, and notices of trademark rights or registration specified by Auriemma, or other notice of Auriemma’s ownership, including copyright, where feasible.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall use' with 'may use', making the use of the Auriemma Identification discretionary. It replaces 'specifically approved' with 'generally acceptable form and manner', removing the requirement for specific approval, and replaced 'shall use' with 'should consider' creating a weaker obligation regarding legends, markings, and notices. This creates legal uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "Auriemma will sign 100 items per year during the Services Period for Berkshire provided all items are to be obtained at Berkshire’s cost, provided,\nhowever, that Berkshire shall not sell any items autographed by Auriemma and Auriemma will not be required to sign any item that is manufactured\nby a competitor of Nike and subject to Nike’s right to disapprove any items.",
                "changed_text": "Auriemma should attempt to sign approximately 100 items per year during the Services Period for Berkshire, assuming items are acquired at Berkshire’s expense. Berkshire should avoid selling autographed items, and Auriemma may decline to sign items produced by Nike competitors, pending Nike’s potential disapproval.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear obligation for Auriemma to sign 100 items, with defined conditions. The modified version weakens this by using 'should attempt', making the signing obligation less definite. The original strict conditions are softened: 'shall not sell' becomes 'should avoid selling', and 'will not be required' becomes 'may decline', removing clarity and enforceability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Creates an unenforceable obligation with vague conditions, potentially rendering this portion of the contract invalid due to lack of clear terms.",

                "changed_text": "Arbitration proceedings or litigation relating to disputes under this Agreement may be initiated in a location deemed suitable by Berkshire.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies the venue for arbitration/litigation. The modified version gives Berkshire unilateral control over the location of legal proceedings, creating uncertainty and potentially violating principles of fairness and due process. This ambiguity disadvantages Auriemma by allowing Berkshire to choose a location that is inconvenient or biased.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Arbitration Act - While supporting arbitration, it also implies fairness and reasonableness in the process, and this unilateral venue selection could be challenged.",

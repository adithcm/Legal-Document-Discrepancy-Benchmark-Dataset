                "original_text": "The Corporation represents, warrants and covenants to the Agents, and acknowledges that the Agents are relying upon such representations, warranties and covenants, that:\n(d)\nthe Corporation has conducted its business in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including all applicable federal, national, provincial, municipal, and local environmental anti-pollution and licensing laws, regulations and other lawful requirements of any governmental or regulatory body, of each jurisdiction in which its business is carried on and is licensed, registered or qualified in all jurisdictions in which it owns, leases or operates its property or carries on business to enable its business to be carried on as now conducted and its property and assets to be owned, leased and operated and all such licences, registrations and qualifications are valid, subsisting and in good standing and it has not received a notice of non-compliance, nor knows of, nor has reasonable grounds to know of, any facts that could give rise to a notice of non-compliance with any such laws, regulations or permits which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and all such licences, registrations and qualifications are valid, subsisting and in good standing;",
                "changed_text": "The Corporation represents and warrants to the Agents, acknowledging the Agents may rely on such representations, that:\n(d)\nthe Corporation has generally operated its business in a manner that it believes to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Corporation possesses licenses and qualifications in jurisdictions where it operates; however, the Corporation does not guarantee complete adherence to every regulation and cannot confirm it has not received notice of non-compliance, nor knows of, nor has reasonable grounds to know of, any facts that could give rise to a notice of non-compliance with any such laws, regulations or permits which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity. Replacing 'in all material respects' with 'generally operated its business in a manner that it believes to be in compliance' weakens the obligation. Adding 'however, the Corporation does not guarantee complete adherence to every regulation' further reduces the legal certainty of compliance. The use of 'cannot confirm' about the lack of non-compliance notices introduces a lack of positive assertion. This undermines the original representation and warranty of full compliance, making it difficult to legally enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "Applicable Securities Laws - Specifically, securities laws in Ontario require corporations to provide accurate and reliable information to potential investors. A vague statement about regulatory compliance could be seen as misleading.",

                "original_text": "(ii)\nno settlement of any such Claim or admission of liability may be made by the Corporation without the prior written\nconsent of the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of\nthe Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and does not include a statement as to or\nan admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.",
                "changed_text": "(ii)\nno settlement of any such Claim or admission of liability may be generally discouraged by the Corporation without the need for the Indemnified Party's consent, unless such settlement is deemed commercially unviable or includes an acceptable liability arising out of such action or claim and includes a potential statement as to or a non-admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the protection afforded to the Indemnified Party. Replacing 'prior written consent' with 'generally discouraged' makes the Corporation's agreement non-binding. Replacing 'unconditional release' with 'acceptable liability' introduces an element of subjectivity. The phrase 'potential statement as to or a non-admission of fault' is contradictory and confusing, making it uncertain whether the Indemnified Party is protected from liability.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Principles of Contract Law - This weakens the Indemnified Party's ability to control the outcome of legal claims and could expose them to undue liability, which general principles of contract law aim to prevent through ensuring fair and reasonable terms.",

                "changed_text": "(mm)\nthe Corporation has not necessarily received any explicit formal notice wherein it is definitively alleged or explicitly stated that it is currently directly and solely responsible for a specific active federal, provincial, state, municipal or local clean-up site or legally mandated corrective action under strict interpretations of current Environmental Laws and the Corporation has not necessarily recently received a legally binding request for official information in connection with currently ongoing federal, state, provincial, municipal or local inquiries as to active large-scale official disposal sites;",
                "explanation": "This change introduces numerous ambiguities to weaken the representation. The addition of qualifiers like \"not necessarily received any explicit formal notice,\" \"definitively alleged or explicitly stated,\" \"currently directly and solely responsible,\" \"strict interpretations of current Environmental Laws,\" \"not necessarily recently received a legally binding request,\" and \"active large-scale official disposal sites\" significantly limits the scope and enforceability of the original warranty. This wording suggests that the Corporation may be involved in potential environmental liabilities but is not explicitly disclosing it. The repeated use of qualifiers leaves the meaning of the representation vague and open to interpretation, making it difficult to hold the Corporation accountable for potential environmental liabilities. These changes also makes it difficult to ensure that the corporation is upholding their environmental duties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Ontario Environmental Protection Act - This act mandates that companies should actively and transparently deal with environmental problems. Modifying the statement on environmental liabilities may result in a failure to comply with disclosure requirements, and could hinder prompt environmental management.",

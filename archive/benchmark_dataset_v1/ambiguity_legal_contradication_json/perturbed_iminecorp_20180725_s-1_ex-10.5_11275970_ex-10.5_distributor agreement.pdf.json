                "original_text": "3.5 Compliance with Laws. The Distributor shall comply at its own expense with all applicable laws and regulations currently existing in Taiwan relating to the sale, distribution and promotion of the Products. Distributor shall not export, directly or indirectly, any Products or related information outside of Taiwan.",
                "changed_text": "3.5 Compliance with Laws. The Distributor shall endeavor to comply, at its own expense, with applicable laws and regulations currently existing in Taiwan relating to the sale, distribution, and promotion of the Products. The Distributor should attempt to prevent the export, directly or indirectly, of any Products or related information outside of Taiwan.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"shall comply\" with \"shall endeavor to comply\", the obligation becomes ambiguous and less enforceable. Similarly, changing \"shall not export\" to \"should attempt to prevent\" weakens the restriction, making it unclear what constitutes sufficient effort to prevent export. This introduces ambiguity regarding the distributor's responsibility to comply with Taiwanese laws and export regulations.",

During the term of this Agreement, the Distributor may (i) announce to the public that it is an authorized non-exclusive the Distributor of the Products, and (ii) advertise the Products under the trademarks, service marks, marks, and trade names that JRVS may adopt from time to time (the “JRVS Trademarks”). JRVS shall provide the Distributor JRVS Trademarks on disk or camera-ready art for production. The Distributor understands that JRVS has applied for applicable federal and state registration of certain of its trademarks and agrees, upon JRVS’s request, to so indicate on the box containing the Products and, in any advertisement,, promotional materials or other documents that contain the Products’ names. Nothing herein will grant to the Distributor any right, title or interest in JRVS Trademarks. At no time during or after the term of this Agreement will the Distributor challenge or assist others to challenge JRVS Trademarks or the registration thereof or attempt to register any trademarks, marks or trade names confusingly similar to those of JRVS. The Distributor shall follow reasonable trademark usage guidelines communicated by JRVS. Distributor’s use of JRVS’s trademarks and trade names shall be subject to JRVS’ prior approval and shall be used only in a manner consistent with JRVS’ trademark use policy.",

During the term of this Agreement, the Distributor may consider announcing to the public that it is a distributor of the Products, and may contemplate advertising the Products under the trademarks, service marks, marks, and trade names that JRVS utilizes from time to time (the “JRVS Trademarks”). JRVS may provide the Distributor JRVS Trademarks on disk or camera-ready art for production if available. The Distributor acknowledges that JRVS might have applied for registration of certain of its trademarks and agrees, upon JRVS’s courteous request, to consider indicating such on the box containing the Products and, in some advertisements, promotional materials or other documents that contain the Products’ names. Nothing herein will grant to the Distributor any guaranteed right, title or interest in JRVS Trademarks. The Distributor will generally not challenge JRVS Trademarks. The Distributor will attempt to follow trademark usage guidelines communicated by JRVS when feasible. Distributor’s use of JRVS’s trademarks and trade names shall be somewhat consistent with JRVS’ trademark use policy.",
                "explanation": "The modified text uses weaker, less definitive language, such as \"may consider,\" \"may contemplate,\" \"might have applied,\" \"courteous request,\" \"consider indicating,\" \"generally not challenge,\" \"attempt to follow when feasible,\" and \"somewhat consistent.\" This introduces substantial ambiguity and reduces the distributor's obligations regarding trademark usage, creating a potential conflict with trademark laws and JRVS's trademark rights. This would make it difficult for JRVS to enforce its trademark rights against the distributor based on this agreement.",

                "original_text": "9.1 Nondisclosure, Non Use. Each party shall treat as confidential all Confidential Information of the other party, shall not use such Confidential Information except as set forth herein, and shall use reasonable efforts not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third party. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall use at least the same degree of care which it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party under this Agreement. Each party shall promptly notify the other party of any actual or suspected misuse or unauthorized disclosure of the other party’s Confidential Information.",

Each party should, where practical, treat as confidential the other party's Confidential Information, and will generally refrain from using such Confidential Information except as set forth herein. Each party may exert reasonable efforts, where possible, to prevent the disclosure of such Confidential Information to any third party. Each party will endeavor to notify the other party of potential misuses of Confidential Information. ",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a specific action ('shall treat as confidential'). The modified version replaces 'shall' with weaker terms ('should where practical, 'generally refrain') creating a lack of clear obligation. The change from 'shall use reasonable efforts' to 'may exert reasonable efforts where possible' makes the protective measure discretionary and also subjective. The change from \"shall promptly notify\" to \"will endeavor to notify\" weakens the notification requirement making it less enforceable. This introduces ambiguity regarding the responsibility to protect confidential information, potentially conflicting with trade secret laws and causing disputes over what constitutes reasonable protection.",

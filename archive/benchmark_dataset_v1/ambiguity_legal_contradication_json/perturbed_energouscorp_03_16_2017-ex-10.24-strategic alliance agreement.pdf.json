                "original_text": "Each party will comply with all law and regulations applicable such partyâ€™s performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to U.S. Export Administration laws and regulations and any other export, import and re-export control laws applicable to such party. The parties will refrain from exporting or re-exporting the Products or Product IP or any technical data or other materials received from each other, or the direct product of any of these, to any country, individual or organization proscribed by the United States government, unless properly authorized by the appropriate agencies of the United States government. Each party will provide all information under its control which is necessary or useful for the other party to ship or receive the Products, including, but not limited to, U.S. Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), U.S. Customs Certificates of Delivery, Certificates of Origin and U.S. Federal Communications Commission identifier, if applicable. Each party agrees that it will not act in any fashion or take any action in violation of any applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation in any jurisdiction in which it does business, which prohibits the offering, giving or promising to offer or give, directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any official of a government, political party or instrumentality to assist it in obtaining or retaining business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any comparable legislation in another country.",
                "changed_text": "Each party will endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding its performance under this Agreement, including U.S. Export Administration laws and regulations, and other relevant export, import, and re-export control laws. The parties will aim to avoid exporting or re-exporting the Products or Product IP to countries, individuals, or organizations proscribed by the United States government, unless authorization is sought when practical. Each party will attempt to provide information necessary for shipping or receiving the Products, including U.S. Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) where feasible. Each party acknowledges its intent to adhere to anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation in jurisdictions where it operates, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a strict legal obligation to comply with all laws and regulations, whereas the modified text introduces ambiguity by using weaker terms like 'endeavor,' 'aim,' 'attempt,' and 'acknowledges its intent.' These changes weaken the binding nature of the clause, making it harder to enforce compliance with laws such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which require strict adherence and do not allow for discretionary compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a strict quarterly update of the escrowed Deposit Materials. The modified text uses ambiguous language such as 'try to keep,' 'generally update,' 'when feasible,' and 'if practical,' making the obligation discretionary. This ambiguity undermines the purpose of the escrow agreement, which is to ensure that DIALOG has access to current and complete information in case of an Insolvency Event or other Release Condition. It contradicts the intent of ensuring business continuity and access to critical data.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract, failure to provide essential data for business continuity as intended by the escrow agreement.",

                "changed_text": "ENERGOUS and DIALOG generally acknowledge that the covenants in this Section 18 are intended to reasonably protect trade secrets, Confidential Information, and stable workforces.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'acknowledge and agree' to 'generally acknowledge' and 'are reasonable and necessary to protect' to 'are intended to reasonably protect' significantly weakens the commitment. The original clause clearly establishes the necessity of the non-solicitation agreement to protect critical business assets and stability. The modified clause suggests a weaker intent, making it more difficult to enforce the non-solicitation agreement in court. The altered language implies a subjective, rather than objective, assessment of the covenants' importance.",

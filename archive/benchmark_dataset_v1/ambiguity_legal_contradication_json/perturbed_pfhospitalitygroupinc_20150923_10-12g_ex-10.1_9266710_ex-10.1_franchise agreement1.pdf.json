                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "You must keep the Premises, vehicles, equipment, and uniforms used in the Franchised Business and/or by your employees in the highest degree of cleanliness, orderliness, appearance, sanitation, and repair in accordance with our standards and specifications, including but not limited to those set out in our Manuals.",
                "changed_text": "You should try to keep the Premises, vehicles, equipment, and uniforms used in the Franchised Business and/or by your employees reasonably clean, orderly, and in a generally acceptable condition, potentially referring to standards and specifications in our Manuals.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict adherence to cleanliness and repair standards. The modified version weakens this by using subjective terms like 'try,' 'reasonably clean,' and 'generally acceptable condition.' This introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce a specific level of maintenance, and it references but does not require following standards in the Manuals.",
                "contradicted_law": "Health and sanitation codes, which mandate specific and strict standards for food service establishments. Depending on the jurisdiction (defaulting to United States law generally) and the specific regulations, the vague language could lead to violations.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "You agree to operate the Franchised Business in full compliance with all applicable municipal, county, state, and federal laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances. You have sole responsibility for such compliance despite any information or advice that we may provide. (To the extent that the requirements of those laws are in conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Manuals, or our other instructions, you must: (a) comply with those laws; and (b) immediately give us written notice of the conflict.)",
                "changed_text": "You generally agree to aim for compliance with most applicable municipal, county, state, and federal laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances. You may consider advice that we provide, but still have some responsibility. (To the extent that the requirements of those laws are perceived to be in conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Manuals, or our other instructions, you could: (a) attempt to comply with those laws; and (b) notify us of a possible conflict.)",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'in full compliance' with 'generally agree to aim for compliance,' weakening the franchisee's obligation. Replacing 'sole responsibility' with 'some responsibility' and replacing the 'must' with 'could' creates uncertainty about liability. This ambiguity undermines the franchisee's accountability for adhering to legal requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Numerous federal, state, and local laws (e.g., ADA, OSHA, wage and hour laws). The ambiguity and weakened obligation makes compliance with these laws uncertain and difficult to enforce.",

                "original_text": "We may require your Operating Principal, Certified Managers, and other designated employees to attend the conferences. You will be solely responsible for all costs incurred by you and your employees in attending any conferences or conventions.",
                "changed_text": "We might suggest that your Operating Principal, Certified Managers, and other designated employees consider attending the conferences. You are generally expected to be somehow responsible for costs connected to your employees going to conferences or conventions.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation for designated employees to attend conferences and for the franchisee to bear all costs. The modified text weakens this by changing 'may require' to 'might suggest,' making attendance optional. Similarly, 'You will be solely responsible' is changed to 'You are generally expected to be somehow responsible,' creating ambiguity regarding financial responsibility and allowing for disputes over who covers the costs.",
                "contradicted_law": "Wage and hour laws: If attendance at the conference is mandatory, then the time spent at the conference is considered work time, and employees must be compensated accordingly. The ambiguity about attendance and financial responsibility contradicts the employer's duty to pay for mandatory training time.",

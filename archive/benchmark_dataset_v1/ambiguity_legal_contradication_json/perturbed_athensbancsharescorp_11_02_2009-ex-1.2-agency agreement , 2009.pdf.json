                "explanation": "Changing \"use their best efforts\" to \"attempt to cause\" and \"will immediately upon receipt of any information\" to \"attempt to immediately upon receipt of information\" weakens the obligation. The original text ensures the Company and Bank will proactively cause an event to happen, while the modified text is far more passive. Furthermore, replacing 'make every reasonable effort' to 'make reasonable effort' adds ambiguity. This is a violation of securities law, such as the Securities Act of 1933, which requires strict compliance with regulatory requests and reporting. The ambiguity introduced could lead to delayed or incomplete responses to regulatory bodies, which can result in penalties.",

The Company will comply with all undertakings contained in the Registration Statement.",

The Company may comply with undertakings contained in the Registration Statement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will comply' with 'will endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation. Furthermore, the 'so far as necessary' is replaced with 'so far as reasonably necessary,' which is ambiguous. Also, replacing 'will comply' to 'may comply' introduces optionality in adhering to regulatory requirements. This contradicts securities laws like the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, particularly Rule 10b-5, which requires strict adherence. The added ambiguity could be interpreted as allowing the Company to selectively follow regulations, conflicting with the mandate for full compliance.",

The Bank will maintain such records of all funds received to permit the funds of each subscriber to be separately insured by the FDIC (to the maximum extent allowable) and to enable the Bank to make the appropriate refunds of such funds in the event that such refunds are required to be made in accordance with the Plan and as described in the Prospectus.",

The Bank will attempt to maintain adequate records of all funds received to permit most of the funds of each subscriber to be separately insured by the FDIC and to partially enable the Bank to make arguably appropriate refunds of some of such funds in the event that such refunds are required to be made in accordance with the Plan and as described in the Prospectus.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"will maintain appropriate arrangements\" with \"will aim to maintain appropriate arrangements\" weakens the certainty of proper fund handling. Changing \"at the rate described\" to \"at approximately the rate described\" introduces ambiguity about the interest rate. Furthermore, replacing \"satisfaction of all conditions precedent\" to \"satisfaction of most conditions precedent\", replacing \"the persons entitled thereto\" with \"some persons entitled thereto\", replacing \"in accordance with the Plan and as described\" with \"in general accordance with the Plan\", replacing \"Bank will maintain such records\" with \"Bank will attempt to maintain adequate records\", replacing \"to permit the funds of each subscriber to be separately insured by the FDIC\" with \"permit most of the funds of each subscriber to be separately insured by the FDIC\", and replacing \"to enable the Bank to make the appropriate refunds of such funds\" with \"to partially enable the Bank to make arguably appropriate refunds of some of such funds\" introduces ambiguity and makes it uncertain that funds are handled to be FDIC-insured. This conflicts with FDIC regulations, which require clear and precise procedures for managing deposit accounts to ensure depositor protection. The ambiguity makes it difficult to verify compliance and puts depositor funds at risk.",

                "explanation": "Adding the phrase 'as reasonably interpreted' introduces ambiguity. This phrase is subjective and could lead to disputes over whether obligations are being met, potentially conflicting with the 'Contract Law of the People's Republic of China' which enforces contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'upon request' to 'if feasible' and replacing 'required' with 'generally understood as necessary' makes the obligation of assistance less definitive. This may lead to uncertainty about which licenses and permits are actually required, potentially conflicting with specific administrative regulations and licensing laws in China.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'every effort to obtain the highest possible price' with 'commercially reasonable efforts to generally seek a fair price' introduces ambiguity. The term 'commercially reasonable efforts' is subjective, and removing the mandate to sell for specific currencies weakens the financial obligation to maximize returns during liquidation. This introduces an ambiguity that could conflict with the 'Company Law of the People's Republic of China' which requires protection of shareholder value during liquidation.",

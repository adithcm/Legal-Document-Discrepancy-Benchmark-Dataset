                "original_text": "The Company shall conduct its Business in conformity with a business plan jointly\nprepared and agreed to by the Parties on or prior to the Effective Date, as may be amended from time to time after the Effective\nDate with the unanimous approval of the Board (the “Business Plan”). In case where the Parties have not agreed on the Business\nPlan as of the date hereof, then the Parties shall continue to discuss in good faith immediately following the execution of this\nAgreement and agree on the Business Plan prior to the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall conduct its Business generally in line with a business plan. The Parties will create a business plan before or after the Effective Date, as the Parties may agree. If the Parties cannot agree, they should discuss the plan in good faith.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the company's obligation to adhere to the business plan. Removing 'in conformity with' and replacing it with 'generally in line with' weakens the commitment. Furthermore, making the creation of the business plan optional by using 'before or after' and 'as the Parties may agree' undermines its enforceability. This contradicts Japanese corporate law, which requires a clearly defined and agreed-upon business plan for joint ventures to ensure transparency and accountability.",

                "original_text": "Each Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and any other Party, its permitted\nsuccessors and assigns, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses including reasonable\nlegal fees and disbursements in connection therewith (collectively, “Claims”) asserted against or incurred by the Company or such\nother Party which arise out of, result from, or may be payable by virtue of, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or\nagreement made or obligation required to be performed by the indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, claims related to the purchase of the Shares under the SPA shall be governed by the indemnification provisions set forth\nin the SPA.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may consider providing indemnification, defense, and support to the Company and any other Party, its successors and assigns, against certain potential losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs, and expenses. The specifics of such support will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Claims related to the purchase of the Shares under the SPA will generally follow the indemnification provisions in the SPA, subject to interpretation.",
                "explanation": "The original text is a clear indemnification agreement, whereas the modified text weakens it considerably. Replacing 'agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless' with 'may consider providing indemnification, defense, and support' makes the indemnification discretionary rather than mandatory. Adding 'potential' before losses and liabilities further dilutes the obligation. The phrase 'subject to interpretation' introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce the indemnification provisions. This creates a contradiction with standard legal expectations regarding indemnification agreements, which are intended to provide clear and enforceable protection against specific liabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding the enforceability and clarity of indemnification agreements. This also increases the risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-corruption laws by making the allocation of liabilities unclear.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be interpreted under principles of international law, and the Parties may consider Japanese law as a guiding reference. In case of discrepancies between the English and Japanese versions, the Parties will use reasonable efforts to reach a consensus.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that the agreement is governed by Japanese law and that the English text controls. The modified version introduces ambiguity by suggesting that the agreement is governed by 'principles of international law,' which is vague and undefined. It then states that Japanese law is only a 'guiding reference,' undermining its authority. Also, replacing 'shall control' to 'will use reasonable efforts to reach a consensus' in discrepancies between English and Japanese versions weakens the enforceability. This contradicts the principle of choosing a specific governing law to ensure predictability and certainty in contractual relationships under Japanese law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Japanese law regarding choice of law in contracts. Also, conflicts with established legal principles of contractual interpretation, where a clear governing law is essential.",

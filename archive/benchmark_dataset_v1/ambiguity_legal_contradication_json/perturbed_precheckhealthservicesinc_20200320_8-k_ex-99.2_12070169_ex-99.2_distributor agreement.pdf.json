                "original_text": "The Distributor accepts the appointment and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promote, market and sell the Products within the Territory, devote such time and attention as may be\nreasonably necessary and abide by the Principal’s policies.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor accepts the appointment and will endeavor to promote, market, and sell the Products within the Territory. The Distributor may devote time and attention as it deems appropriate and generally follow the Principal's policies.",
                "explanation": "The original text has a definite obligation on the Distributor. Changing \"shall use its commercially reasonable efforts\" to \"will endeavor\" weakens the obligation. Replacing \"devote such time and attention as may be reasonably necessary\" with \"may devote time and attention as it deems appropriate\" makes the effort discretionary. Replacing \"abide by the Principal’s policies\" with \"generally follow the Principal's policies\" introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of compliance required. This creates uncertainty as to the level of effort the distributor is legally bound to exert, potentially conflicting with standard contract law principles requiring good faith and fair dealing. Additionally, because the Distributor operates in the United States, the ambiguity created can be interpreted as failing to make commercially reasonable efforts to sell their products, in accordance with the implicit understanding that each party will attempt to derive value from a contract. Under the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, both parties must refrain from purposefully depriving the other party of the benefits of the agreement.",

The Distributor represents and warrants\nthat the Distributor shall conduct business in strict conformity with all local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor will attempt to obtain the necessary licenses and permits. The Distributor intends to conduct business in general accordance with local, state, and federal laws, rules, and regulations.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"shall obtain\" to \"will attempt to obtain\" and \"shall conduct business in strict conformity\" to \"intends to conduct business in general accordance\" significantly weakens the legal obligations. Licenses and permits are often mandatory, and operating without them violates regulations. 'General accordance' is ambiguous and does not guarantee full compliance with laws. This could result in the distributor operating illegally or without proper authorization, creating a breach of contract and potential legal liabilities. This introduces an ambiguous and potentially non-compliant obligation, particularly considering the contract's reference to U.S. laws and the need for specific licenses for distributing medical products.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that official communication must be in writing or email and acknowledged, creating a clear legal standard for communication. By changing \"shall be\" to \"should ideally be\" and \"acknowledged by the recipient\" to \"with acknowledgment encouraged,\" the obligation is significantly weakened. It becomes unclear whether verbal communication or unacknowledged written communication is legally binding, creating ambiguity in the agreement's enforcement. This could result in disputes over whether notice was properly given, affecting issues such as contract termination or changes in terms.",

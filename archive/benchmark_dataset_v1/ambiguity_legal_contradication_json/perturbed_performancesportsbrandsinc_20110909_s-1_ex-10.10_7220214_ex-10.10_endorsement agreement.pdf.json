                "original_text": "Company agrees that it will not use North’s Likeness or North’s Endorsement hereunder unless and until all Advertising Materials and their intended use has been approved by North. North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by North within seven (7) business days after receipt thereof. North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Company will be advised of the specific grounds for the disapproval. Company shall not use such disapproved Advertising Materials until it has written approval from North.",
                "changed_text": "Company may use North’s Likeness or North’s Endorsement hereunder, and North’s approval of Advertising Materials will not be unreasonably withheld. North's silence on Advertising Materials shall only be considered as implicit approval if North has been properly notified and has had a reasonable amount of time to review the materials. If North disapproves, they will endeavor to communicate the reasons. Company will attempt to gain written approval from North before using disapproved Advertising Materials.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities. The original text stipulated a mandatory approval process. The revised language replaces 'agrees that it will not use... unless and until all... has been approved' with permissive language ('Company may use... and North’s approval... will not be unreasonably withheld'). The original text also explicitly stated that silence after seven business days constituted approval. The revision changes this to 'reasonable amount of time,' making it subjective and open to interpretation. It also changes the mandatory ‘Company shall not use’ to ‘Company will attempt to gain’. This weakens North's control over their likeness and endorsement, creating potential disputes over unauthorized use.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida Statutes Chapter 540.08, which governs the unauthorized use of a person's name or likeness for commercial purposes. The ambiguity created could weaken North's ability to claim unauthorized use, as the definition of 'reasonable time' and 'unreasonably withheld' introduces subjective elements that could be challenged in court.",

                "changed_text": "North will consider using F2 branded irons, woods and putter at Public Events, taking into account his professional judgment.",
                "explanation": "The original text says the athlete will make ‘reasonable efforts’, but then clarifies that they aren't actually required to use the products, creating an unenforceable obligation. The revised text changes this to consider using them based on ‘professional judgment’ which is entirely subjective and provides North with complete discretion, nullifying any real obligation to promote the specified products. This ambiguity weakens the endorsement agreement, as there is no guaranteed use of F2 branded equipment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles under Florida law, as the ambiguity makes it difficult to prove a failure to perform a contractual obligation. The 'consider' and 'professional judgment' clauses provide no clear standard for compliance, rendering the clause effectively unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Company represents and warrants to North that it will comply with all rules, regulations, laws, orders, decrees and ordinances of the United States, each state and political subdivision thereof, and each and every foreign country having legal jurisdiction over any aspect of Company’s activities under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the use of North’s Likeness in advertisements for and on behalf of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Company generally intends to comply with applicable rules, regulations, laws, orders, decrees and ordinances related to its activities under this Agreement, to the extent reasonably practicable.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear and absolute warranty of compliance with all applicable laws. The modified text weakens this obligation significantly by stating a mere 'general intent' to comply 'to the extent reasonably practicable.' The addition of 'to the extent reasonably practicable' introduces a subjective element, allowing the Company to avoid compliance based on its own assessment of what is reasonable. This creates ambiguity about the scope of the Company's legal obligation and creates an easy excuse for non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract and potential violations of consumer protection laws (e.g., Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act) if the company fails to comply with relevant laws and regulations in its advertising and marketing practices. By weakening the compliance warranty, the company opens itself to potential liability and makes it more difficult for North to enforce compliance.",

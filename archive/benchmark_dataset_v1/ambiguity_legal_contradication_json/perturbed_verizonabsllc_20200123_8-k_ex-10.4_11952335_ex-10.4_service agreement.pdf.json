            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Servicer will manage, service, administer and collect on the Receivables with reasonable care using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises for all comparable device payment plan agreement receivables that it services for itself or others according to the Servicing Procedures.",
                "changed_text": "The Servicer will endeavor to manage, service, administer and collect on the Receivables with reasonable consideration for the best interests of all parties. The specifics of skill and attention will be at the Servicer's discretion, taking into account Servicing Procedures.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the obligation to manage and collect receivables. The 'endeavor to' and 'reasonable consideration' language makes the obligation less strict. Replacing the standard of skill and attention with Servicer's discretion introduces subjectivity.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change contradicts general contract law principles that require a standard of reasonable care and diligence in fulfilling contractual obligations, potentially leading to non-compliance with regulatory requirements for asset-backed securities.",

                "original_text": "The Servicer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or advisable to collect each Receivable in accordance with this Agreement and the Servicing Procedures using commercially reasonable care and diligence and in any event, with no less care or diligence than the Servicer exercises in collecting other similar receivables or obligations owed to it and its Affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "The Servicer should consider taking actions to collect each Receivable, taking into account this Agreement and the Servicing Procedures. The degree of care and diligence will be based on the Servicer's assessment of what is practical and efficient.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall take' to 'should consider taking' makes the collection of receivables discretionary. Replacing 'commercially reasonable care and diligence' with 'assessment of what is practical and efficient' further weakens the standard and introduces ambiguity, potentially failing to meet minimum standards for debt collection.",
                "contradicted_law": "Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), which mandates that debt collectors act with reasonable care. This change weakens the obligation, making compliance with the FDCPA uncertain.",
                "location": "Section 3.2(b)"

                "changed_text": "The Servicer will attempt to maintain perfection of the security interest of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in each Receivable as much as reasonably possible.",
                "explanation": "The wording introduces ambiguity by replacing the definite 'will maintain' with 'will attempt to maintain as much as reasonably possible'. The phrase 'as much as reasonably possible' does not guarantee the maintenance of perfection, contradicting the original clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "UCC Article 9, which dictates specific steps required for maintaining a perfected security interest. This change conflicts with the strict requirements for perfection, potentially jeopardizing the secured status of the receivables.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Reseller must ensure that Sub-Reseller complies with the terms of the Agreement applicable to Reseller as if Sub-Reseller were an original party to the Agreement and any breach by Sub-Reseller of the Agreement will be deemed a breach by Reseller.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller should encourage Sub-Reseller to comply with the terms of the Agreement applicable to Reseller, and any significant breach by Sub-Reseller may be considered a breach by Reseller depending on the circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the obligation on the Reseller to ensure compliance by the Sub-Reseller, replacing 'must ensure' with 'should encourage.' It introduces ambiguity by making the breach determination conditional ('may be considered...depending on the circumstances') rather than automatic, therefore making the application of the contract more difficult to apply.",

                "changed_text": "The terms and conditions herein generally constitute the agreement between the Parties regarding the primary subject matter of this Sub-Reseller Agreement and aim to supersede previous agreements to a reasonable extent.",
                "explanation": "By inserting words like 'generally', 'primary', and 'to a reasonable extent,' we create ambiguity about the completeness and exclusivity of the agreement. This makes it harder to determine if other agreements or understandings might still be relevant.",
                "contradicted_law": "Parol Evidence Rule (General Contract Law) - Undermines the principle that the written contract is the final and complete expression of the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "SFDC may consider SUB-RESELLER (“Sub-Reseller”) as a potential sub-reseller to whom Reseller could potentially resell Services, subject to certain interpretations of Section 2(ii) of the Agreement, with the understanding that Sub-Reseller should generally aim to resell such Services to Customer.",
                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty around the appointment of the sub-reseller. Replacing 'hereby appoints' with 'may consider' and 'could potentially resell' weakens the legal obligation and makes the role and responsibilities of the sub-reseller unclear. The addition of 'subject to certain interpretations' adds further ambiguity about the applicability of Section 2(ii).",

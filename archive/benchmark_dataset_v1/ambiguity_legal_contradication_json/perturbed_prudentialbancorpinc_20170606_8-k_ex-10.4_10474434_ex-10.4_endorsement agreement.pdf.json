                "original_text": "The Employer will have and may exercise, except as limited hereinafter, all ownership rights in the Policies. The Employer will not take any action in dealing with the Insurer that would impair any right or interest of the Employee in the Policies.",
                "changed_text": "The Employer may exercise ownership rights in the Policies, subject to its discretion. The Employer will endeavor not to take actions that significantly impair the Employee's perceived rights or interests in the Policies.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the employer will not impair the employee's rights. The changed text introduces ambiguity by stating the employer will 'endeavor not to,' weakening the obligation. The term 'perceived rights' is subjective and vague, making it difficult to enforce the original intent. This contradicts the principle of good faith and fair dealing implied in Pennsylvania contract law, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance of their contractual obligations. Using discretionary language creates ambiguity, especially regarding vested rights.",

                "changed_text": "The Employer will attempt to provide to the \"Insurer\" a written statement indicating the approximate amount of each policy's proceeds the Employee's beneficiary may be entitled to receive, as soon as reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear 60-day deadline. The modified text uses the terms 'attempt,' 'approximate,' 'may be entitled to,' and 'as soon as reasonably practical', all of which create ambiguity regarding the employer's obligation and timeline. The original obligation is weakened by 'attempt' and 'may be entitled to' - 'approximate' introduces vagueness regarding the accuracy of the statement. The timeline now depends on what the employer deems 'reasonably practical', contradicting the specificity required for proper policy payout after death, which creates a breach of fiduciary duty. This potentially contradicts Pennsylvania's laws regarding prompt and accurate settlement of life insurance claims.",

The Employer agrees from time to time to make the policies available to the Employee or to the \"Insurer\" for the purpose of endorsing or filing any change of beneficiary on the Policies but the Policies will promptly be returned to the Employer.",
                "changed_text": "The Employer will generally keep possession of the Policies. The Employer will consider making the policies available to the Employee or to the \"Insurer\" for endorsing or filing changes, but the Employer's decision is at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This section originally states the Employer *will* make policies available to the Employee. This modified language introduces 'consider' and 'generally', creating ambiguity. The phrase 'sole discretion' grants the Employer absolute power, potentially hindering the Employee's ability to change beneficiaries effectively. This ambiguity could conflict with Pennsylvania law related to beneficiary rights and the employee's reasonable expectation of access to policy documents for beneficiary changes, particularly when the original agreement provided more definitive access.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'shall' to 'may' introduces ambiguity regarding which subsidiaries and related companies are bound by the agreement. The addition of 'based on reasonable business considerations' makes the application of the agreement subjective and potentially unenforceable, contradicting standard contract law principles that require clear and definite terms. This violates the principle of mutual assent, making the obligation to follow the amendment unclear for some of the subsidiaries.",

                "changed_text": "Company shall endeavor to ensure that uses of the name of the NFLA generally align with applicable law.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'ensure' with 'endeavor to ensure' and 'comply' with 'generally align' weakens the obligation and makes it ambiguous what level of compliance is required. This could lead to non-compliance with advertising regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "California False Advertising Law - Specifically, the standard of ensuring accuracy and avoiding misleading claims in advertising.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees that...may be deemed' to 'suggests that...may be considered' and replacing 'ten (10) business days' with 'a reasonable timeframe' makes the approval process vague. There is no clear timeframe, which creates ambiguity on what constitutes approval and could result in unauthorized use of the NFLA Identification. This is a deviation from basic contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic Contract Law - A clear timeline of actions is typically required for a contract to be enforceable. The vagueness is in violation of that aspect of basic contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Company aims to continue producing and marketing Licensed Products in a generally consistent manner, subject to their ongoing assessment of commercial viability.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees that it will continue in good-faith' with 'aims to continue' and removing the reference point of 'September 2017' introduces ambiguity. Additionally, omitting 'unless Company and the NFLA/NFLA-NC believe it is not commercially reasonable to continue to produce and market the Licensed Products' creates a loophole allowing the Company to stop producing and marketing the Licensed Products whenever they believe that is no longer feasible. This is a violation of good faith.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Applicable Laws\" means all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders,\nwrits, injunctions and decrees of any kind.",
                "changed_text": "\"Applicable Laws\" means laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, writs, injunctions and decrees that are generally considered applicable.",
                "explanation": "The term 'generally considered applicable' introduces ambiguity, as it is unclear who determines what is 'generally considered applicable.' This contradicts the need for clear and definitive compliance with all applicable laws, potentially leading to non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Vague wording contradicts standards of legal clarity and enforceability.",
                "location": "Article I, Definitions"

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall ensure' to 'shall endeavor to ensure' weakens the obligation to obtain written agreements assigning ownership rights. This could lead to Conformis not actually securing these assignments, creating uncertainty over intellectual property ownership, since ‘endeavor’ does not have a clear legal meaning.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change undermines clear requirements for IP assignment, conflicting with standard practices for protecting intellectual property rights.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall be solely responsible' with 'may be responsible,' making the responsibility discretionary rather than mandatory. The term ‘potentially’ is also ambiguous.",

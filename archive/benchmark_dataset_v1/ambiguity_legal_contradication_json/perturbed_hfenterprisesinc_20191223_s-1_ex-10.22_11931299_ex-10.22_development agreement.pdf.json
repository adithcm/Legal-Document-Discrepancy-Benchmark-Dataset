                "original_text": "Developer shall be fully liable, without limitation, for money damages resulting from its\nimproper or unauthorized use, modification, alteration, licensing or transfer of the Technology or Improvements, or resulting from its failure to\nprovide functional and merchantable Improvements hereunder, which failure shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Developer.",
                "changed_text": "Developer may be liable, subject to mutual agreement, for damages allegedly resulting from its use, modification, licensing, or transfer of the Technology or Improvements. The failure to provide functional Improvements might be considered a potential breach.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the developer's liability for damages. The modification introduces ambiguity by using 'may be liable, subject to mutual agreement', making the liability conditional and weakening the obligation. Stating that the failure to provide functional improvements 'might be considered a potential breach' further diminishes the certainty of the obligation, creating a gray area regarding accountability and enforcement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Laws in New York (where DSS is located) generally require clear and enforceable obligations. This ambiguity makes it difficult to prove a breach with the certainty required in New York courts.",

            {

                "original_text": "Developer covenants that it shall not attempt, directly or indirectly, during the term of this\nAgreement or at any time thereafter, (i) to reverse engineer, by any means whatsoever, the Technology or other Intellectual Property provided to\nDeveloper hereunder, for any unauthorized purpose, and further acknowledges that such Technology and Intellectual Property has been provided\nhereunder by DSS solely for the purpose of enabling Developer to fully perform its legal duties and obligations hereunder, (ii) to forensically,\ngraphically or otherwise physically analyze the Technology or Intellectual Property provided to Developer hereunder for any unauthorized\npurpose, or (iii) to compile/assemble, decrypt, or create any derivative works based upon the Technology or Intellectual Property of DSS, for any\nunauthorized purpose. Any violation of this clause shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by the Developer.",
                "changed_text": "Developer should avoid attempting to reverse engineer, where feasible, the Technology or Intellectual Property provided. Analyzing the technology should be avoided if practical, and derivative works should generally not be created for purposes outside the scope of the intended development. A significant violation of this general guideline might be viewed as a breach.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits reverse engineering and analysis. The modified text uses softer language like 'should avoid' and 'where feasible', creating ambiguity. It replaces a definitive prohibition with a suggestion and introduces subjectivity. It also modifies the breach statement by using 'might be viewed as a breach' rather than 'shall be deemed a material breach', reducing the severity of potential consequences and thus weakens the original legal obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Intellectual Property Laws, specifically trade secret protection. By weakening the prohibition on reverse engineering, the modified text makes it more difficult for DSS to protect its trade secrets under New York law. Clear prohibitions against reverse engineering are crucial for maintaining trade secret status.",

Notices shall be sent to the Parties at the following addresses or fax numbers or such other addresses or fax numbers as the parties\nsubsequently may provide in accordance with this Section 9.8:",
                "changed_text": "All notices regarding this Agreement should be in writing and are considered given when delivered in good faith (i) via any method reasonably expected to reach the party; (ii) sent by e-mail without specifying PDF, or facsimile when conveniently possible; (iii) mailed via standard or certified mail, as appropriate; or (iv) sent through a courier when expeditious delivery is preferred. Parties may update addresses by informing the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause dictates the method of delivering a notice and when the notice can be considered as given. The modified version includes ambiguous terms such as \"should be\", \"any method reasonably expected\", \"conveniently possible\", and \"as appropriate\". This undermines the requirement of writing in notices and the exact ways to ensure that the other party receives the information as required. This is because the delivery, the way the message is communicated, and method are now interpreted rather than regulated.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law for Notice: Under the law, notices are a key component of contracts. When these are not enforced, one party can take advantage of the other, leading to legal and financial troubles. This is especially important in states like New York that require clear guidelines for businesses.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Supplier shall maintain adequate books and records and retention samples consistent with cGMP Requirements and any other Applicable Law and requirements of applicable governmental or regulatory authorities, in respect of test records, samples and associated support data for all batches of Product Manufactured by Supplier sufficient to substantiate and verify Supplier’s duties and obligations under this Agreement for [* * *] from the expiration date of the respective Product batch.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier shall endeavor to maintain books and records and retention samples, potentially consistent with cGMP Requirements and any other Applicable Law, regarding test records, samples, and support data for Product batches. This is intended to generally substantiate Supplier’s obligations under this Agreement for a reasonable period from the batch's expiration.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall maintain adequate' with 'shall endeavor to maintain,' making the record-keeping obligation less stringent. The phrase 'potentially consistent' introduces ambiguity regarding adherence to cGMP requirements. Replacing '[* * *] from the expiration date' with 'a reasonable period' introduces vagueness about the retention duration. These ambiguities weaken the enforceability of regulatory compliance.",

Each Party will provide reasonable assistance to the other, at no charge, if necessary to respond to audits, inspections, inquiries, or requests of any Applicable Regulatory Authority.",

Parties will consider offering assistance to each other, resources permitting, regarding audits, inspections, or inquiries from Regulatory Authorities.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be responsible' to 'will aim to' weakens the commitment to compliance. The phrase 'with consideration for' introduces ambiguity. By adding 'resources permitting,' providing assistance during regulatory actions becomes discretionary, creating potential non-compliance issues.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall provide reasonable co-operation' to 'will attempt to provide cooperation, as is practically feasible,' makes the cooperation discretionary and conditional.

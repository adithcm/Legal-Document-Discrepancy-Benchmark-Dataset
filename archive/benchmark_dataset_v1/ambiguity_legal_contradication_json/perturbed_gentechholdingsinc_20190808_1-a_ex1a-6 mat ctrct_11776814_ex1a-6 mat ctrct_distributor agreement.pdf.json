                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and refrain from selling or otherwise transferring, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory, without the express written consent of Company.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor should endeavor to limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and may consider refraining from selling or otherwise transferring, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory, absent any written communication from Company.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall limit' to 'should endeavor to limit' and 'refrain from selling' to 'may consider refraining' significantly weakens the obligation to restrict sales within the territory. Replacing 'express written consent' with 'absent any written communication' creates ambiguity about what constitutes permission, potentially conflicting with the need for clear territorial restrictions. This change could create ambiguities as to whether the distributor has the rights to sell outside of their defined territory.",

                "original_text": "Company shall have Seven (7) business days after its receipt to accept (or reject for a legitimate business reason) any order submitted by Distributor. Should Company fail to timely accept or reject an order from Distributor in accordance with this Section, such order shall be deemed accepted and shall become binding on Company. All orders shall be fulfilled by Company within Seven (7) business days of order acceptance.",
                "changed_text": "Company will generally have approximately Seven (7) business days after its receipt to consider accepting or rejecting any order submitted by Distributor. If Company does not explicitly reject an order from Distributor, such order may be considered accepted at Company's discretion. Orders will be fulfilled by Company within a reasonable timeframe following acceptance.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall have Seven (7) business days' to 'will generally have approximately Seven (7) business days' makes the deadline less strict. Replacing 'reject for a legitimate business reason' with 'consider accepting or rejecting' weakens the requirement for a valid reason for rejection. Changing 'shall be deemed accepted and shall become binding' to 'may be considered accepted at Company's discretion' introduces significant ambiguity about order acceptance. Replacing 'All orders shall be fulfilled by Company within Seven (7) business days of order acceptance' with 'Orders will be fulfilled by Company within a reasonable timeframe following acceptance' makes the fulfillment timeline vague and unenforceable. This creates ambiguity around the company's order processing and fulfillment obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles under Florida law, related to clarity and enforceability of contractual obligations, particularly regarding order acceptance and fulfillment timelines. The modified clause introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to determine when an order is legally accepted and when it must be fulfilled.",

                "changed_text": "Company generally represents that the Products will be reasonably free from significant defects in design, materials and workmanship and substantially conform with most specifications provided.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'generally', 'reasonably free from significant defects', and 'substantially conform with most specifications' weakens the warranty, introduces subjective judgment, and creates ambiguity. 'Significant defects' is open to interpretation. This weakens the guarantees that Company provides for the products.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida's implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which requires goods to be fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. The modifications introduce ambiguity, making it difficult to determine if the products meet the minimum requirements for merchantability and fitness for purpose.",

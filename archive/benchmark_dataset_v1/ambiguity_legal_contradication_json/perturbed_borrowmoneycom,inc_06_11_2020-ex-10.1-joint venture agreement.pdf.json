                "changed_text": "Maintenance of books of account and financial records as the Managers deem appropriate",
                "explanation": "By changing 'according to accepted accounting practices' to 'as the Managers deem appropriate,' the requirement becomes vague and open to interpretation. This contradicts the general requirement of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) for financial record-keeping.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'will contribute' with 'will endeavor to contribute' weakens the obligation to contribute capital. This weakens the enforceability of the capital contribution clause. A simple \"endeavor\" does not ensure contributions are made, potentially violating the intent of the agreement and creating financial instability for the joint venture.",

                "changed_text": "The Venture may consider insuring its assets against loss if deemed necessary.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'The Venture will insure' to 'The Venture may consider insuring' and adding 'if deemed necessary,' the obligation to insure assets becomes discretionary rather than mandatory. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the intent to protect the venture's assets, leaving it vulnerable to uncovered losses.",

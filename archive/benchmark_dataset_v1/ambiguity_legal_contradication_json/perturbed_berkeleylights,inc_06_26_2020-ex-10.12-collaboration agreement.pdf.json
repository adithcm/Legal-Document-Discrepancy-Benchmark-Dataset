                "original_text": "During the Term, each Party will use diligent efforts to implement and perform (itself or through its Permitted Subcontractors) its respective obligations under and in accordance with (a) this Agreement and (b) each Workflow Development Plan in accordance with the timelines set forth in such Workflow Development Plan. Each Party will reasonably cooperate with each other in the performance of their responsibilities under this Agreement and each Workflow Development Plan, including (i) responding to reasonable requests by the other Party submitted in accordance with this Agreement to provide information reasonably necessary for the performance of such requesting Party’s obligations under this Agreement (including any Workflow Development Plan) and (ii) causing its personnel, agents and representatives, while at the other Party’s facility, to abide by the written work rules and facility regulations applicable to such facility as provided in advance by such other Party.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, each Party will attempt to implement and perform (itself or through its Permitted Subcontractors) its respective obligations under (a) this Agreement and (b) each Workflow Development Plan. Each Party will consider cooperating with each other in the performance of their responsibilities under this Agreement and each Workflow Development Plan, including (i) responding to requests by the other Party submitted in accordance with this Agreement to provide information for the performance of such requesting Party’s obligations under this Agreement (including any Workflow Development Plan) and (ii) encouraging its personnel, agents and representatives, while at the other Party’s facility, to adhere to the work rules and facility regulations applicable to such facility.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation from 'will use diligent efforts' to 'will attempt' and 'will reasonably cooperate' to 'will consider cooperating'. The language regarding adhering to facility regulations also changes from a strict obligation to a mere encouragement, this creates ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding 'good faith' and 'reasonable efforts,' which are often interpreted strictly by courts. Also, potential OSHA violations if facility regulations are not strictly followed.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Permitted Subcontractors to, maintain records in sufficient detail for the other Party to confirm compliance with this Agreement and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes under Applicable Law, which shall properly reflect all activities conducted and results achieved by such Party under this Agreement. Such records shall be retained by such Party, its Affiliates or Permitted Subcontractors until [***] ([***]) years after the end of the period to which such books and records pertain or for such longer period as may be required by Applicable Law. Each Party shall have the right, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to inspect all such records of the other Party, its Affiliates or Permitted Subcontractors. The reviewing Party shall be responsible for all costs of the inspection but shall have no right to copy or retain records. All disclosed records and the information disclosed therein shall be treated as Confidential Information in accordance with Article 10 (Confidentiality).",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should endeavor to maintain records with details that allow the other Party to generally understand the activities conducted and high level results achieved under this Agreement. Such records may be retained by such Party, its Affiliates or Permitted Subcontractors. Each Party may request to inspect such records of the other Party, its Affiliates or Permitted Subcontractors. The reviewing Party shall be responsible for reasonable costs of the inspection. All disclosed records and the information disclosed therein shall be treated as Confidential Information in accordance with Article 10 (Confidentiality).",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce significant ambiguity. The original text mandates maintenance of records with sufficient detail for compliance confirmation and retention for a specific period. The altered text uses weaker language ('should endeavor,' 'generally understand,' 'may be retained,' 'may request'), making the record-keeping obligation less stringent and clear. The removal of the 'good scientific manner' requirement introduces further uncertainty about the quality and standards for record maintenance. Removing the restriction on copying/retaining records provides ambiguity to what a reviewing party can do with confidential information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal regulations, such as those from the FDA or EPA, which mandate specific and detailed record-keeping procedures, especially in collaborations involving potential patent rights.",

Such insurance (i) will be primary insurance with respect to each Party’s own participation under this Agreement and (ii) will be issued by a recognized insurer rated by A.M. Best “A-VII” (or its equivalent) or better, or an insurer pre-approved in writing by the other Party.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will attempt to obtain and carry insurance. Such insurance (i) should be primary insurance with respect to each Party’s own participation under this Agreement and (ii) should be issued by a recognized insurer.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will obtain and carry in full force and effect the minimum insurance requirements' to 'will attempt to obtain and carry insurance' and removing specifics about the rating of insurance companies, this modifies the binding requirement of maintaining insurance. This creates ambiguity around what is defined as insurance. Removing language describing ‘minimum insurance requirements’ and A.M. Best ratings creates a subjective standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard contract law principles require clear and definite terms, especially in clauses pertaining to risk allocation and insurance. If a party fails to maintain proper insurance, this could lead to a breach of contract and potential liability issues.",

                "original_text": "Party B shall ensure the vehicles are in good conditions, the compartments are properly sealed without leakage and the vehicles are\nequipped with fire-fighting equipment. In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the\nstandard rate of RMB200 per parcel, and indemnify the actual price for high-end insured parcel (or indemnify by the value of the\nparcel provided by arbitration department determined by Party A).",
                "changed_text": "Party B should endeavor to ensure the vehicles are in reasonably good conditions, and the vehicles may be equipped with fire-fighting equipment. In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B will consider indemnifying at a rate it finds suitable, considering the arbitration department's non-binding suggestion.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on Party B to ensure vehicle conditions and provides a set indemnification rate for damages. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall ensure' with 'should endeavor to ensure,' making the vehicle maintenance standard less strict. Also, it removes the 'properly sealed without leakage' requirement, and changes 'are equipped' to 'may be equipped,' making fire-fighting equipment optional. It also weakens the obligation to indemnify by replacing 'shall indemnify at the standard rate' with 'will consider indemnifying at a rate it finds suitable', and reduces the arbitration department's determined value to a 'non-binding suggestion', making indemnification discretionary and less predictable. It contradicts regulations on vehicle safety and cargo protection, which require specific standards and procedures for transporting goods.",

                "original_text": "Party B shall have valid and legal licenses for national road transportation. In the event of loss caused to Party A by delivery delay due\nto vehicles detention for the lack of license, Party B shall compensate for any loss to Party A.",
                "changed_text": "Party B should attempt to maintain what it perceives to be valid licenses for road transportation. In the event of loss caused to Party A by delivery delay due to vehicles detention for a perceived lack of license, Party B might consider compensating for any direct loss to Party A.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall have' to 'should attempt to maintain what it perceives to be valid licenses,' it introduces subjectivity into the licensing requirement. The original clause mandates Party B to have valid licenses and compensate for any loss due to a lack thereof. However, the modified clause suggests Party B's perception of validity is acceptable. Also, replacing 'shall compensate for any loss' with 'might consider compensating for any direct loss' weakens the obligation to compensate and introduces a condition of 'direct loss,' which may be difficult to determine. This conflicts with the regulatory requirements for road transportation, which mandate strict licensing and compensation for losses due to non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Party B will make available, if conveniently possible, copies of some licenses and documents to Party A, and represents that to the best of its knowledge, these documents are believed to be valid and legal. Party B’s drivers preferably have some experience in large trucks. Party B is expected to address any reasonable concerns arising from its perceived non-compliance, without guaranteeing specific outcomes.",
                "explanation": "This change dilutes the obligation to provide complete and authentic documents by using phrases like 'will make available, if conveniently possible, copies of some licenses,' 'to the best of its knowledge, these documents are believed to be valid,' and 'preferably have some experience.' These phrases introduce ambiguity regarding the extent and veracity of document provision and the required experience level of drivers. The final sentence softens the liability for non-compliance. By not fully guaranteeing the authenticity, completeness, legality and validity of such licenses and materials, it contradicts requirements that ensure the safety and regulatory compliance of transportation services.",

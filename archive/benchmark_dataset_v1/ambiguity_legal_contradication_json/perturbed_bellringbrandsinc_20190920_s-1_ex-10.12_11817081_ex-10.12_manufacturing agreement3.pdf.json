                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered to Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A, which Schedule may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the “Specifications”), shall conform to Post Holding’s Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and shall conform in all material respects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage.",
                "changed_text": "All Products manufactured, packaged, and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement should generally conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A and/or Schedule A-1, which Schedules may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the “Specifications”), should endeavor to conform to Post Holding’s Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and should attempt to conform to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'should generally conform', 'should endeavor to conform', and 'should attempt to conform' introduce ambiguity and weaken the obligation to adhere to specifications, quality standards, and samples. This makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "The **Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA)** requires strict adherence to manufacturing standards and quality control processes. Weakening the language around conformance with specifications and quality manuals introduces a potential violation of FSMA regulations regarding process controls and adherence to established standards.",

                "changed_text": "Heritage will aim to purchase ingredients and packaging materials identified in Schedule C as needed for the manufacturing of Products. Heritage will generally invoice Premier through a billing process somewhat similar to that identified on Schedule C.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall purchase' to 'will aim to purchase' and 'shall invoice' to 'will generally invoice' with 'somewhat similar' introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation to procure necessary materials and follow the agreed-upon billing process. This could lead to disputes over costs and material availability.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could be deemed as a violation of **Contract Law** which requires a clear agreement on payment terms and obligations. The ambiguity introduced contradicts the requirements for a clear and enforceable contract, particularly regarding payment and material procurement.",

                "changed_text": "Heritage will typically charge Premier [***], ideally in accordance with Schedule C.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"shall charge\" with \"will typically charge\" and adding \"ideally in accordance with,\" the obligation to charge as agreed upon in Schedule C is weakened. This ambiguity allows for potential deviations from the agreed-upon pricing structure and payment terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change undermines the principle of **Contract Law**, where specific payment terms must be clearly defined and adhered to. The modification creates uncertainty and potential grounds for disputes over pricing, potentially violating contract enforcement principles.",

                "original_text": "Company will use its best efforts to deliver the Client Website in the time frame specified in the Scope of Work. Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",
                "changed_text": "Company will attempt to deliver the Client Website within a reasonable timeframe, generally corresponding to the time frame specified in the Scope of Work. The project is expected to take approximately 12 weeks. Client acknowledges that any due dates are estimates and may be adjusted based on Company's workload and the availability of resources.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'best efforts' with 'attempt' and adding 'generally corresponding to', the obligation to deliver within a specific timeframe becomes less binding. The addition of 'may be adjusted based on Company's workload and the availability of resources' makes the deadline entirely discretionary. This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the delivery schedule.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding 'good faith' and 'reasonable efforts,' which require more than a mere attempt, especially when a specific timeframe is initially indicated.",

                "original_text": "All written content submitted by Client for use in the Client Website must be typewritten, proofread and delivered to Company in the body of an email message or as a Microsoft Word electronic document or plaint text electronic document. Any content submitted by Client in any other manner or format, including, but not limited to Adobe PDF format, will be returned to Client for resubmission. Company will not make any attempt to proof read or correct any contextual, grammatical or typographical errors in the written content submitted by Client. It is Client’s sole responsibility to check the accuracy of the written content and correct any errors prior to submission for final publication. Company will assume that all the written content submitted by Client has been proofread and is ready for publication. Client may elect to pay Company the Hourly Rate set forth below to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above.",
                "changed_text": "Client should provide written content in a commonly used digital format. While efforts will be made to accommodate various formats, the Company may request resubmission in an alternate format if compatibility issues arise. The Company is not responsible for proofreading or correcting errors in Client's content. It remains the Client's responsibility to ensure accuracy before publication.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly outlines the required format for content submission. The modified text softens this requirement by stating the Client 'should provide' content in 'a commonly used digital format,' which is vague. 'May request' makes resubmission discretionary rather than mandatory. This change creates ambiguity about the acceptable formats and the consequences of non-compliance, weakening the Client's obligation to provide content in a specific manner.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding clarity and specificity in contractual obligations. Vague requirements can lead to disputes about performance and breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "Company, either directly or through its authorized service provider, shall provide customer service (the “Customer Service”) relating to Client Website consisting of replying to customer questions or complaints regarding website hosting services during the normal business hours set forth. Company is not obligated to provide any Customer Service except as specified in this Section. Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.",
                "changed_text": "Company will attempt to provide customer service related to website hosting services during normal business hours, subject to availability. The level and nature of customer service may vary at Company's discretion, and Company reserves the right to modify or discontinue customer service offerings without prior notice.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall provide' with 'will attempt to provide, subject to availability,' making the provision of customer service discretionary. Replacing 'consisting of replying to customer questions or complaints' with 'level and nature of customer service may vary' removes the specific obligation to address customer inquiries. By reserving the right to 'modify or discontinue customer service offerings without prior notice,' the company can unilaterally change the agreed-upon service level. This creates uncertainty about the actual customer service to be provided.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding the duty of good faith and fair dealing. A complete reservation of the right to alter or cease providing a contracted service can be seen as a breach of this duty, especially when the service is integral to the value of the agreement.",

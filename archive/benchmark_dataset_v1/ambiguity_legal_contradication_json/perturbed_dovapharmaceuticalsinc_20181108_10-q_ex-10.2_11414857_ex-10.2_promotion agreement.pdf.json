                "explanation": "Changing 'comply in all respects' to 'make reasonable efforts to ensure' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity. It's unclear what constitutes 'reasonable efforts,' making enforcement difficult.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall direct promptly' to 'shall endeavor to direct in a timely manner' and 'Dova shall address' to 'Dova will attempt to address' introduces ambiguity. 'Endeavor' and 'attempt' are weaker obligations and the definition of 'timely manner' is undefined, making it difficult to prove non-compliance.",

Valeant shall instruct the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to, and will monitor the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to ensure that such Field Force Personnel, limit their claims of efficacy and safety for the Product to those claims which are consistent with and do not exceed the Product Labeling and any Promotional Materials.",

Valeant should also encourage the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to generally limit their claims of efficacy and safety for the Product to claims which are consistent with the Product Labeling and any Promotional Materials.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Valeant shall instruct and cause' to 'Valeant should encourage', the mandatory nature of the clause is weakened. Also, adding 'generally' before 'use' and 'limit' introduces ambiguity. These changes make it harder to enforce the use of approved materials and the limitation of claims, conflicting with FDA regulations regarding promotion of drugs.",

                "changed_text": "Without prejudice to any term and condition under this Agreement, the Company should endeavor to maintain in force, at all times during the Term and [*****], at its own costs and expenses, with insurers that it believes to be of internationally recognized",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on the company to maintain specific insurances. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall maintain' with 'should endeavor to maintain' and 'insurers of internationally recognized reputation reasonably acceptable to the Repairer' with 'insurers that it believes to be of internationally recognized.' This makes the insurance requirement less strict and more subjective. Whether the company has adequately 'endeavored' or 'believed' becomes a matter of interpretation.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not be cancelled' to 'should attempt not to be cancelled' weakens the obligation, making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This could lead to the company not providing adequate notice, resulting in potential gaps in insurance coverage.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Repairer 'shall use' endeavors to carry out the services. The modified version states the Repairer 'may use' endeavors 'to endeavor to carry out' the services. This makes the original strong obligation much weaker. Making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. The 'may' and double 'endeavor' weaken the sentence.",

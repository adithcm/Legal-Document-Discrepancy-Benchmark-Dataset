                "original_text": "Applicable Laws” means any and all (i) laws, statutes, rules, regulations, by laws, codes, treaties, constitutions and ordinances, including\nPrivacy Legislation (“Laws”), (ii) order, directive, judgment, decree, award or writ of any court (including a court of equity), arbitrator or\narbitration panel, or any Governmental Authority or other body exercising adjudicative, regulatory, judicial or quasi-judicial powers,\nincluding any stock exchange (“Orders”), and (iii) policies, guidelines, standards, requirements, notices and protocols of any\nGovernmental Authority (“Policies”); which are applicable to or govern CHT, Ehave or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "“Applicable Laws” means laws, statutes, rules, regulations, by laws, codes, treaties, constitutions and ordinances, including Privacy Legislation (“Laws”), which may be relevant. Any order, directive, judgment, decree, award or writ of any court may be considered. Policies, guidelines, standards, requirements, notices and protocols of any Governmental Authority may also be taken into account. All of the aforementioned considerations are at the discretion of both parties; which are applicable to or govern CHT, Ehave or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Applicable Laws' creates a clear obligation to comply with all laws, orders, and policies. The modified definition introduces ambiguity and discretion by using phrases like 'may be relevant,' 'may be considered,' and 'may also be taken into account,' making compliance optional rather than mandatory. By stating the consideration of laws, orders, and policies are at the discretion of both parties, the clause makes it unclear which standards are enforceable, potentially leading to non-compliance with various laws, regulations, and standards relevant to data privacy and business operations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various privacy laws and regulatory compliance standards, such as PIPEDA (Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and industry-specific regulations, which require mandatory and specific compliance measures rather than discretionary considerations.",

                "original_text": "Ehave shall implement and maintain those safeguards and controls set out in Schedule “5” to deter and for the detection, prevention and\ncorrection of any unauthorized intrusion, access or use of the Ehave Companion Solution, as well as to protect against any loss, theft or\nunauthorized access, use, disclosure, copying, or modification of End User Data. CHT acknowledges and agrees, and shall obtain such\nacknowledgement and agreement from its End Users, that notwithstanding the Security Requirements, such methods and procedures may\nnot prevent unauthorized electronic intruders to access the Ehave Companion Solution through the Internet or through other form of\nelectronic communication. If such unauthorized electronic intruders are able to bypass Ehave’s security protocols, firewall and safeguards,\nsuch unauthorized electronic intruder may change, delete or otherwise corrupt the contents and data contained in the Ehave Server,\nincluding any End User Data. Except for the maintenance of appropriate firewall and safeguards in compliance with the Security\nRequirements, which are designed to frustrate access from unauthorized electronic intruders, Ehave shall not be liable to CHT or to any of\nits End users, and hereby disclaims responsibility, with respect to any action, destructive or otherwise, by any unauthorized electronic\nintruder.",
                "changed_text": "Ehave will endeavor to implement safeguards and controls, as practical, based on available resources, to deter unauthorized access or use of the Ehave Companion Solution, and to protect against loss or unauthorized access of End User Data. CHT acknowledges that even with security measures, unauthorized access may occur. Ehave is not responsible for actions by unauthorized electronic intruders. Ehave will attempt to maintain firewalls and safeguards, but does not guarantee their effectiveness and is not liable for any destructive actions by intruders.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Ehave 'shall implement and maintain' specific safeguards. The modified version weakens this by stating Ehave 'will endeavor to implement safeguards and controls, as practical, based on available resources,' making the implementation dependent on Ehave's discretion and resources. By removing the reference to Schedule 5 and stating that Ehave is not responsible for actions by unauthorized electronic intruders, regardless of the Security Requirements, contradicts data protection laws. The term 'attempt' to maintain firewalls makes it unclear what steps are necessary for compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "PIPEDA (Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) requires organizations to implement and maintain specific and reasonable security measures to protect personal information, not just make an effort based on available resources.",

CHT will attempt to retain such records for what it views as a reasonable period.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'CHT shall keep detailed records' and 'shall retain such records' for a defined period. The modified version changes this to 'CHT will endeavor to keep records' and 'CHT will attempt to retain such records,' making the obligation to maintain records discretionary and subjective. By replacing a specific retention period with 'what it views as a reasonable period,' compliance becomes highly ambiguous.",
                "contradicted_law": "Tax laws and regulations in Canada (such as the Income Tax Act) mandate specific record-keeping requirements and retention periods for financial transactions. This modification contradicts these laws by making record-keeping discretionary rather than mandatory and by allowing CHT to subjectively determine the retention period.",

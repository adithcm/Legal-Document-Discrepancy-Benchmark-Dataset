                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize sales of NETGEAR Products.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will attempt to increase sales of NETGEAR Products.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will attempt to increase sales' introduces ambiguity. 'Attempt' lacks a defined standard, making it difficult to measure if the distributor is meeting its obligations. This weakens the original obligation to actively maximize sales.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall be the sole point of contact for its resale customers and their end-use customers in all support situations. Distributor shall provide first level support for its customers, NETGEAR shall provide second and third level support to Distributor in order to resolve end user technical problems.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will endeavor to be the primary contact for its resale customers and their end-use customers regarding support. Distributor will try to provide initial support, while NETGEAR may offer further support to Distributor when available to address end-user technical issues.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the support obligation by replacing 'shall' with 'will endeavor to' and 'will try to,' making the level of support discretionary rather than mandatory. Replacing 'sole point of contact' with 'primary contact' introduces possible multiple points of contact. The phrase 'when available' makes NETGEARâ€™s support discretionary, leading to non-compliance with reasonable support expected in distribution agreements.",

Each party agrees to maintain adequate internal procedures, including appropriate agreements with employees and authorized third parties, to protect the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information as required by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each party will consider the Proprietary Information of the other as confidential and will generally use the Proprietary Information for purposes that are consistent with the spirit of this Agreement, and may disclose Proprietary Information to its employees and contractors when it seems reasonable and necessary. Each party will attempt to implement internal guidelines to maintain the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'agrees to hold in confidence' with 'will consider as confidential,' reducing the binding nature of the confidentiality obligation. Replacing 'expressly permitted' with 'consistent with the spirit' and 'need-to-know basis' with 'reasonable and necessary' makes the use and disclosure of proprietary information subjective. Replacing 'agrees to maintain adequate internal procedures' with 'will attempt to implement internal guidelines' further weakens the protection of proprietary information.",

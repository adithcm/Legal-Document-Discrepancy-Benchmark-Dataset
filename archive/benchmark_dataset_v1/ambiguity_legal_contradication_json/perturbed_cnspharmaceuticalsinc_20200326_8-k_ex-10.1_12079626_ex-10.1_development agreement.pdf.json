                "explanation": "Replacing \"hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify\" with \"agrees to endeavor to indemnify\" weakens the obligation to indemnify. Changing \"caused by, arising out of, or resulting from\" to \"possibly caused by, arguably arising out of, or speculatively resulting from\" introduces uncertainty about the causal link required for indemnification. Limiting \"reasonable and documented attorney's fees\" to just \"attorney's fees\" potentially introduces ambiguity regarding the scope and recoverability of these expenses. This violates the principle of clear and unambiguous contract terms, potentially making the indemnification clause unenforceable under Texas law.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"shall at all times keep books, records and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\" to \"will attempt to keep books, records and accounts which, in their opinion, generally reflect\" introduces subjectivity and weakens the requirement for accurate record-keeping. Replacing \"sufficient to provide reasonable assurances\" with \"they deem sufficient\" further weakens the obligation and introduces a subjective standard.

                "explanation": "Modifying \"will at all times during the Term be in material compliance\" to \"will endeavor to be in compliance with what they perceive to be the core tenets\" weakens the compliance obligation and introduces subjectivity. Changing \"commercially reasonable actions to comply\" to \"may attempt to take what they consider to be appropriate actions to comply\" makes compliance discretionary. Replacing \"reasonably likely to create a material liability\" with \"could potentially create a liability\" lowers the threshold for triggering compliance efforts. Replacing \"To ensure material compliance\" with \"To ostensibly ensure compliance\" questions the intent and Replacing \"commercially reasonable steps reasonably designed to ensure compliance\" with \"some steps intended to suggest compliance\", suggesting the efforts are for show rather than actual compliance. This change makes it easier for WPD to argue they are compliant even if their actions do not fully meet GDPR standards. The vague language provides an opportunity for WPD to avoid liability, even in cases where clear breaches of GDPR have occurred.",

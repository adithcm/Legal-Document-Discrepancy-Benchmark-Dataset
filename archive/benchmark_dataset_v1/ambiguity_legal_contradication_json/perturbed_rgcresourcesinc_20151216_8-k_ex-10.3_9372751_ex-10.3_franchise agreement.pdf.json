                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise maintain at least one business office within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per week for the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers.",
                "changed_text": "Grantee shall endeavor to maintain a business presence within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. The presence should be available during normal business hours as reasonably determined by Grantee.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a physical office open for a defined number of hours. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'maintain at least one business office' with 'endeavor to maintain a business presence' and replacing 'forty (40) hours per week' with 'normal business hours as reasonably determined by Grantee.' This could be interpreted as not requiring a physical office at all, and the hours of operation are left to the Grantee's discretion.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts Virginia consumer protection laws requiring reasonable access to businesses providing essential services like gas distribution.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Grantee shall not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, or any other basis prohibited by state law relating to discrimination in employment, except where there is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the Grantee.",
                "changed_text": "Grantee shall strive not to discriminate based on common protected characteristics, unless business needs suggest otherwise.",
                "explanation": "This alteration weakens the anti-discrimination clause. Replacing 'shall not discriminate' with 'shall strive not to discriminate' introduces a subjective element. Furthermore, changing the specific protected characteristics and the clear exception to 'unless business needs suggest otherwise' creates a broad and undefined exception, potentially justifying discriminatory practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates Virginia's anti-discrimination laws, which provide specific protections against discrimination in employment and services. The broad 'business needs' exception undermines these protections.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "All notices required under this Agreement or the Ordinance shall be in writing and shall be deemed validly given, unless otherwise required, when sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a nationally recognized overnight courier, addressed as follows (or any other address the party to be notified may have designated to the sender by like notice):",
                "changed_text": "All important communications should be in writing. The parties may choose a reasonable method of delivery for these communications.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the notice requirements. The original clause mandates specific methods of delivery (certified mail or overnight courier) to ensure proof of delivery. The changed text replaces this with vague language ('should be in writing,' 'reasonable method of delivery'), creating uncertainty about what constitutes valid notice. It is ambiguous on the exact method to use.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change could undermine the enforceability of the contract, particularly concerning deadlines and legal obligations. Virginia law generally requires clear and unambiguous notice procedures for legal matters.",

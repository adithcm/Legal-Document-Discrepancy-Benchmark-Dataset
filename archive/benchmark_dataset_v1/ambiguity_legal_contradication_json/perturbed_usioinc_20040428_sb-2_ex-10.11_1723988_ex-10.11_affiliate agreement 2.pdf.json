Affiliate shall locate, establish and maintain such offices (the \"Local Office\"), as it deems necessary for use by all Contractors identified by Affiliate and accepted by Network 1.  Network 1 expressly agrees that Affiliate shall not be geographically restricted in its establishment of such offices.  Local Office has met the satisfaction of Network 1 in terms of space, quality, appearance, equipment, supplies, office hours, support staff, working conditions, and other factors materially affecting the working conditions of its Contractors.  All Local Offices shall bear signs, emblems and other insignia, including a telephone number, indicating that the office is in fact an office of Network 1 subject to the conditions of 4.02. However, all leases, utility listing, telecommunication, furniture and equipment expense, employment contracts for support personnel and other contracts relating to the operation of the Local Office shall be in the name of the Affiliate and shall be the sole responsibility of the Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "1.02     LOCAL OFFICE (AFFILIATE OFFICE).  Affiliate shall locate, establish and maintain such offices (the \"Local Office\"), as it deems appropriate for use by all Contractors identified by Affiliate and accepted by Network 1.  Network 1 suggests that Affiliate should not be geographically restricted in its establishment of such offices.  Local Office will generally meet the satisfaction of Network 1 in terms of space, quality, appearance, equipment, supplies, office hours, support staff, working conditions, and other factors materially affecting the working conditions of its Contractors.  Local Offices will attempt to bear signs, emblems and other insignia, including a telephone number, indicating that the office is, to some degree, associated with Network 1 subject to the conditions of 4.02. Leases, utility listing, telecommunication, furniture and equipment expense, employment contracts for support personnel and other contracts relating to the operation of the Local Office may be in the name of the Affiliate and should generally be the responsibility of the Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguities by replacing 'shall' with 'as it deems appropriate', 'suggests that Affiliate should not', 'will generally meet', 'will attempt to bear', 'to some degree, associated with' and 'should generally be'. These weaken the obligations of the Affiliate regarding the Local Office's characteristics and branding, making it difficult to enforce specific standards. Furthermore, changing 'shall be' to 'may be' in the context of leases and responsibilities introduces uncertainty about the Affiliate's accountability.",
                "contradicted_law": "This potentially violates basic contract law principles regarding the definiteness of terms. If the contract is too vague about essential terms (like the standards for the Local Office), it may be deemed unenforceable. While not directly violating a specific statute, it undermines the enforceability of the contract in Texas (where the Affiliate's principal place of business is) and Virginia (where Network 1's principal place of business is).",

Affiliate agrees to submit all Merchant Agreements procured by Affiliate in accordance with this Agreement to Network 1.  Network 1 agrees to review and approve or decline all Merchant Agreements submitted by Affiliate to Network 1 in accordance with Network 1's approval policy.  Affiliate acknowledges that approval of a Merchant creates a customer relationship between Bank and the Merchant, which involves, among other things, the collection and disbursement of funds to process and settle Merchant Transactions.  Bank and Network 1 shall, in its sole discretion, make the final decision as to whether or not approve or decline any Merchant Agreement submitted to Bank in accordance with this Agreement.  Network 1 agrees to make reasonable efforts to review and approve or decline all Merchant Agreements submitted to Network 1.",
                "changed_text": "1.05     NETWORK  1  TO  APPROVE  ALL MERCHANTS AGREEMENTS.  Affiliate agrees to submit all Merchant Agreements procured by Affiliate in accordance with this Agreement to Network 1.  Network 1 intends to review and approve or decline Merchant Agreements submitted by Affiliate to Network 1 based on general approval guidelines. Affiliate acknowledges that approval of a Merchant may create a customer relationship between Bank and the Merchant, which involves, among other things, the collection and disbursement of funds to process and settle Merchant Transactions.  Bank and Network 1 may, at their discretion, consider whether to approve or decline any Merchant Agreement submitted to Bank in accordance with this Agreement.  Network 1 will endeavor to review and approve or decline Merchant Agreements submitted to Network 1.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'agrees to review and approve' with 'intends to review', 'in accordance with Network 1's approval policy' with 'based on general approval guidelines', 'creates' with 'may create', 'shall, in its sole discretion, make the final decision' with 'may, at their discretion, consider' and 'agrees to make reasonable efforts' with 'will endeavor to review', the text introduces ambiguity about Network 1's obligation to thoroughly review and approve or decline merchant agreements. It creates uncertainty about the standards used, the definitiveness of creating a customer relationship, and the finality of the approval process.",
                "contradicted_law": "This weakening of the obligation potentially contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts. By making the approval process less defined and discretionary, Network 1 could arbitrarily reject merchant agreements, depriving the Affiliate of expected compensation. This could violate Texas contract law if the affiliate is treated unfairly.",

                "explanation": "The changes from 'shall not' to 'should generally not', the addition of 'if avoidable', 'without consideration', and 'unless necessary' introduce ambiguity. These phrases weaken the restrictions on the Affiliate's contact with key entities. The Affiliate could argue that contacting these entities was unavoidable or that the representations were made with 'consideration', creating loopholes.",
                "contradicted_law": "This potentially undermines the security and confidentiality provisions expected in financial agreements. Direct contact with VISA, MasterCard, or the Member Bank could expose confidential information or create unauthorized liability. While not directly violating a statute, weakening these restrictions increases the risk of violating PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) requirements for secure handling of cardholder data, especially if the Affiliate is not adequately trained or supervised. This is relevant in both Texas and Virginia.",

                "original_text": "All actions by each Party related to this Agreement will comply with applicable laws and regulations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision will be interpreted or applied so as to require a Party or its Affiliates, to do, or to refrain from doing, anything which would constitute a violation of, or be penalized by, any applicable laws and regulations or result in a loss of economic benefit under such laws or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will endeavor to ensure that its actions related to this Agreement are generally aligned with applicable laws and regulations. It is understood that no provision should be interpreted rigidly to force a Party or its Affiliates into actions that might technically violate a law or regulation, or lead to a perceived loss of economic benefit under such laws or regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using phrases such as 'endeavor to ensure,' 'generally aligned,' and 'technically violate,' which weakens the obligation and makes compliance discretionary. This could allow a party to argue that substantial compliance is sufficient, even if specific laws are violated, especially if strict adherence would result in a 'perceived' economic disadvantage.",
                "contradicted_law": "This modification creates a risk of non-compliance with various environmental, labor, and securities laws. Specifically, with regard to compliance to Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which demands high level of integrity.",

                "original_text": "FCE will keep, or cause to be kept, true books, records, and accounts in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and containing all information necessary for the accurate determination of all amounts payable to FCE under this Agreement, and any other obligations under this Agreement. Such books, records and accounts will be maintained for a period of at least three (3) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, provided there are no pending disputes between the Parties. In the case of a dispute, the books, records, and accounts will be maintained for one (1) year following resolution of such dispute.",
                "changed_text": "FCE will use its best efforts to maintain books, records, and accounts that generally reflect its financial activities, aiming to align with basic accounting principles. These records will be kept for a reasonable period after the agreement ends, taking into account whether there are any ongoing disputes.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the original clear legal obligation to keep 'true' books and records in accordance with GAAP. By replacing 'true books, records, and accounts in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles' with 'books, records, and accounts that generally reflect its financial activities, aiming to align with basic accounting principles' introduces subjectivity. The phrase 'reasonable period' is vague. This ambiguity could allow FCE to dispose of records prematurely or manipulate them without clearly violating the contract, as it's unclear what constitutes 'generally reflect' or a 'reasonable period'.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires companies to maintain accurate and reliable financial records and implement internal controls to ensure the integrity of financial reporting. The SOX mandates specific retention periods and strict compliance with GAAP.",

                "original_text": "At the request of ExxonMobil, FCE will permit, at reasonable intervals and during regular business hours, during the Term of this Agreement and at least three (3) years thereafter, but no more than once per fiscal year, an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing selected by ExxonMobil (and approved by FCE, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld) to inspect, during regular business hours, such books, records, and accounts and any part of the applicable operations and facilities of FCE relevant to this Agreement, and to have access to FCEâ€™s knowledgeable personnel, as may be necessary to determine the completeness and accuracy of any accounting and payments required to be made under this Agreement and compliance with other terms of this Agreement, subject to the following:",
                "changed_text": "Upon a general request from ExxonMobil, FCE will consider allowing, at times that are not unduly disruptive, an accounting firm to review some of FCE's relevant financial documents, subject to FCE's internal approval processes and confidentiality concerns. The scope and frequency of such reviews will be subject to mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "This significantly weakens ExxonMobil's audit rights by changing mandatory language ('FCE will permit') to discretionary language ('FCE will consider allowing'). The terms 'general request', 'times that are not unduly disruptive', 'some of FCE's relevant financial documents', 'internal approval processes and confidentiality concerns', and 'mutual agreement' all introduce ambiguity and give FCE significant control over whether and how the audit is conducted, undermining the original intent of ensuring accountability and transparency.",
                "contradicted_law": "This undermines the ability to comply with auditing standards and potentially conflicts with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) if the audit limitations prevent a thorough and independent assessment of financial records.",

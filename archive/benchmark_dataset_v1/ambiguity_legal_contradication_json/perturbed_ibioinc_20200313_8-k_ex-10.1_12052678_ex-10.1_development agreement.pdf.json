                "original_text": "iBio will work with CC-Pharming to perform a thorough Manufacturing Development Program based from an initial comprehensive two- day charrette to be held at its subsidiary iBio CDMO LLC facility in Bryan, Texas with the goals of CC-Pharming understanding the definitive capital expenditure necessary and initiating a preliminary design for the first Product. iBio will provide an architect, construction supervisor, mechanical engineer and process engineer with knowledge of the iBio CDMO facility currently in operation in Bryan, Texas.",
                "changed_text": "iBio will attempt to work with CC-Pharming to perform a Manufacturing Development Program based from an initial charrette. iBio may provide personnel with knowledge of the iBio CDMO facility currently in operation in Bryan, Texas.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'will attempt' and 'may provide' introduce ambiguity and weaken the obligation of iBio to provide comprehensive support. The removal of 'thorough' and 'definitive capital expenditure' makes the obligations less concrete. This might not meet the standard of 'reasonable efforts' required to fulfill the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding 'good faith' and 'reasonable efforts' in fulfilling contractual obligations. Texas law requires parties to act in good faith.",

                "changed_text": "CC-Pharming represents and warrants that it will endeavor to maintain iBio’s Technology and technical information confidential, and will take steps to safeguard such information, employing care as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall maintain strictly confidential at all times' with 'will endeavor to maintain...confidential' weakens the obligation. 'Take all steps necessary' is replaced by 'take steps,' removing the obligation to take all possible measures. Replacing 'reasonable business care' with 'care as it deems appropriate' introduces subjectivity and lessens the commitment to a specific standard of care.",

                "original_text": "The Agreement Administrators shall meet regularly as required during the term of this Agreement, but at least two (2) times each calendar year, at a mutually agreeable location, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld. The face-to-face meetings may be replaced with conference calls or video conferences upon request by a Party.",
                "changed_text": "The Agreement Administrators should aim to meet during the term of this Agreement, potentially through face-to-face meetings, conference calls, or video conferences.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall meet regularly' with 'should aim to meet' makes the meeting attendance optional rather than mandatory. Removing the 'at least two (2) times each calendar year' clause eliminates a concrete frequency requirement. Furthermore, removing 'at a mutually agreeable location, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld' removes the requirement for a physical meeting if one party is being uncooperative and replacing the option for 'face-to-face meeting replacement' with 'potentially' makes the meetings optional.",

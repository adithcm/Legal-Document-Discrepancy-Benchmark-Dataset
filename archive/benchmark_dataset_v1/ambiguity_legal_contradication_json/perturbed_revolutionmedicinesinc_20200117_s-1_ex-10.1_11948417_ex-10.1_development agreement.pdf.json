                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each of RevMed and Sanofi will use its commercially reasonable good faith efforts to remove promptly any and all impediments to consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining government antitrust clearance, cooperating in good faith with any Governmental Authority investigation, promptly producing any documents and information and providing witness testimony if requested by a Governmental Authority.",
                "changed_text": "Each of RevMed and Sanofi will consider using reasonable efforts to remove impediments to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, perhaps obtaining government antitrust clearance, and may consider cooperating with any Governmental Authority investigation or producing documents if they deem it appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation to use 'commercially reasonable good faith efforts' to obtain government antitrust clearance and cooperate with investigations. The modified text replaces 'commercially reasonable good faith efforts' with 'consider using reasonable efforts,' making the standard less stringent and introducing ambiguity. The use of 'perhaps obtaining' and 'may consider' weakens the commitment to obtaining antitrust clearance and cooperating with investigations, making these actions discretionary. This introduces ambiguity about what actions each party must take.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, RevMed shall use diligent efforts to conduct its activities under each Research Plan in accordance with the terms of such Research Plan (including timelines), as the same may be amended from time to time (and which basis for comparison shall be tolled until any then-contemplated or pending amendments are completed or for the duration of any bona fide dispute between the Parties with respect to a Research Plan or amendment thereto), and this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In furtherance of the foregoing, RevMed should endeavor to conduct its activities under each Research Plan, taking into account the terms of such Research Plan and this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'diligent efforts' to comply with the Research Plan, which is a reasonably strong commitment. The modified text softens this to 'should endeavor,' which is less forceful and more discretionary. The removal of 'including timelines' eliminates a specific, measurable component of the obligation, making compliance more vague. This conflicts with requirements of clearly defined research obligations.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "If at any time during the period commencing on the Effective Date, there is a consecutive [***] period during which Sanofi [***] and such [***] is not (A) by written agreement of the Parties, (B) a result of [***], (C) as a result of [***], (D) a result of [***], or (E) a direct result, in whole or in part, of [***], then RevMed shall promptly notify Sanofi in writing upon becoming aware of such [***].",
                "changed_text": "If at any time during the period commencing on the Effective Date, there is a period during which Sanofi maybe consider to have [***] and such [***] is arguably not (A) by written agreement of the Parties, (B) a result of unforeseen issues, (C) as a result of potential new information, (D) a result of changing priorities, or (E) a possible result, in some part, of [***], then RevMed is encouraged to notify Sanofi in writing if they are reasonably sure that such an event may have occurred.",
                "explanation": "Original text stipulates a clear, consecutive period that triggers a notification requirement. This perturbation uses more uncertain language, making it harder to determine when notification is actually necessary. The 'maybe consider to have' weakens the initial trigger, and the use of arguably and potential makes it very hard to trigger the 'Encouraged to notify,' is even weaker, suggesting there is no strong action required by RevMed.",

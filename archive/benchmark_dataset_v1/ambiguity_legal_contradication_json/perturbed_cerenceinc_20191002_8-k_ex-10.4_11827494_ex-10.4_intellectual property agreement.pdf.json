                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In order to carry out the intent of the Parties with respect to the recordation of the transfers of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP, as applicable, to the extent the ownership thereof has transferred from a member of the Nuance Group to a member of the SpinCo Group, or vice versa, pursuant to the Separation Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, the Parties shall execute intellectual property assignments in a form substantially similar to that attached as Exhibit A1 (the “Patent Assignment Agreement”), Exhibit A2 (the “Trademark Assignment Agreement”), Exhibit A3 (the “Domain Name Assignment Agreement”) and Exhibit A4 (the “Invention Disclosure Assignment Agreement”) as well as such additional case specific assignments as deemed appropriate or necessary under applicable Laws (collectively, the “Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements”) for recordation with the appropriate Governmental Authority.",
                "changed_text": "In order to carry out the intent of the Parties with respect to the recordation of the transfers of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP, as applicable, to the extent the ownership thereof has transferred from a member of the Nuance Group to a member of the SpinCo Group, or vice versa, pursuant to the Separation Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, the Parties may execute intellectual property assignments in a form substantially similar to that attached as Exhibit A1 (the “Patent Assignment Agreement”), Exhibit A2 (the “Trademark Assignment Agreement”), Exhibit A3 (the “Domain Name Assignment Agreement”) and Exhibit A4 (the “Invention Disclosure Assignment Agreement”) as well as such additional case specific assignments as considered reasonably appropriate or necessary under applicable Laws (collectively, the “Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements”) for recordation with the appropriate Governmental Authority.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the parties 'shall execute' the IP assignments, indicating a clear obligation. The modified text replaces 'shall execute' with 'may execute' and 'deemed appropriate or necessary' with 'considered reasonably appropriate or necessary', making the execution of IP assignments optional and subject to a reasonableness standard. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of this obligation, potentially conflicting with requirements for clear and timely recordation of IP transfers.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law requires clear and unambiguous contractual language to ensure enforceability. This change introduces ambiguity, potentially violating this principle of contract law.",

                "original_text": "Prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, each Party shall cooperate with the other Party, without any further consideration and at no expense to the other Party, to obtain, cause to be obtained or properly record the release of any outstanding Security Interest attached to any Nuance IP or SpinCo IP that is subject to assignment from one Party or its Group to the other Party or its Group hereunder, as applicable, and to take, or cause to be taken, all actions as the other Party may reasonably be requested to take in order to obtain, cause to be obtained or properly record such release.",
                "changed_text": "Prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, each Party will attempt to cooperate with the other Party, without any further consideration and at no expense to the other Party, to potentially obtain the release of security interests attached to IP. Each party will try to take actions as the other Party finds convenient to take in order to obtain such release.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall cooperate' to 'will attempt to cooperate,' the obligation to cooperate is weakened, making it less enforceable. Replacing 'properly record' with 'potentially obtain' introduces uncertainty about the outcome of the cooperation. Additionally, saying each party 'will try to take actions as the other Party finds convenient to take' instead of 'may reasonably be requested to take' weakens the obligation, creating ambiguity about the scope and nature of the required actions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law requires parties to make good-faith efforts to fulfill their contractual obligations. This change could be interpreted as allowing a party to avoid fulfilling its obligations under the contract, conflicting with the implied duty of good faith.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and agreements to consummate, and make effective, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties will consider using reasonable efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take, or cause to be taken, actions, and to do, or cause to be done, things deemed necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall use reasonable best efforts' to 'will consider using reasonable efforts' significantly reduces the obligation. 'Deemed necessary' introduces a subjective standard, potentially allowing a party to avoid taking actions that are objectively necessary. Replacing 'all actions' with 'actions' is slightly vague, as it's not comprehensive anymore.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law requires parties to fulfill their contractual obligations in good faith. By introducing ambiguity and reducing the obligation to use 'reasonable best efforts,' this change weakens the enforceability of the clause, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith.",

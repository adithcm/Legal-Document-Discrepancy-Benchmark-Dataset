                "original_text": "Hydraspin shall obtain such authorizations, licenses, permits, and other governmental or regulatory agency approvals, if any, as are required for the distribution and sale of the Products in the Territory. Distributor will incur no liability arising from Hydraspin’s possession, or lack of possession, of such requisite governmental authorizations and approvals.",
                "changed_text": "Hydraspin will endeavor to obtain necessary authorizations, licenses, permits, and other governmental or regulatory agency approvals, if any, as deemed reasonably necessary for the distribution and sale of the Products in the Territory. Distributor may share in the liability arising from Hydraspin’s possession, or lack of possession, of such governmental authorizations and approvals, as determined by mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear obligation on Hydraspin to obtain all required authorizations. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'endeavor to obtain' and 'as deemed reasonably necessary,' introducing ambiguity. The original text shields the Distributor from liability, whereas the modified text makes it possible for the Distributor to share liability, creating a loophole. This contradicts environmental and safety regulations that require specific, non-discretionary permits and holds parties strictly liable.",

                "original_text": "Hydraspin shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to supply the Products as provided in this Agreement. In the event that the demand for any Product exceeds Hydraspin’s delivery capabilities, Hydraspin shall exercise a good faith effort to allocate available Products production resources on a pro rata basis so that Distributor will receive Product in the same ratio as Distributor’s purchases of such Product during the period contemplated by the purchase order bears to Hydraspin’s total distribution of such Product during such period.",
                "changed_text": "Hydraspin will aim to supply the Products as provided in this Agreement. In the event that demand exceeds delivery capabilities, Hydraspin may allocate available Products production resources as it sees fit, considering various factors.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'commercially reasonable efforts' and a 'pro rata basis' for product allocation, creating a clear, measurable obligation. The modified text replaces 'shall use' with 'will aim,' making the obligation less stringent. Replacing 'shall exercise a good faith effort to allocate available Products production resources on a pro rata basis' with 'may allocate available Products production resources as it sees fit' makes the allocation process discretionary and undefined, removing the requirement for a fair allocation. This ambiguity could be construed as a breach of contract, but would be difficult to prove. This undermines the principle of good faith and fair dealing implied in Texas contract law.",

During the term of this Agreement, Distributor shall afford to Hydraspin and its authorized representatives full access at all reasonable times and upon reasonable prior notice, to all such books and records with respect to the Products.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will maintain books and records relating to the Products. Distributor will allow Hydraspin access to such books and records as deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'complete and accurate' records and 'full access at all reasonable times' for Hydraspin. The modified text removes the requirement for 'complete and accurate' records and uses the vague term 'will allow Hydraspin access to such books and records as deemed appropriate.' This change introduces an ambiguity, as Hydraspin's access is now discretionary. This introduces ambiguity regarding compliance with financial reporting requirements, making the enforcement of transparency and accountability more difficult, and goes against the Texas Business Organizations Code.",

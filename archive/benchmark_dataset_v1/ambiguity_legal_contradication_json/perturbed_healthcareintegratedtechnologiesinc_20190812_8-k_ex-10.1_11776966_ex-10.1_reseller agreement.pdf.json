                "original_text": "By fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement, the Reseller shall: (i) comply with all applicable laws and regulations;",
                "changed_text": "By fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement, the Reseller shall, to the extent practicable: (i) endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations;",
                "explanation": "Changing 'comply with all applicable laws and regulations' to 'endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations' introduces ambiguity. 'Endeavor to comply' suggests an attempt rather than strict adherence, weakening the obligation. Adding 'to the extent practicable' provides room to claim they cannot comply with it due to circumstances. This potentially contradicts laws that require strict compliance, such as safety regulations or consumer protection laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and state laws requiring strict compliance, including consumer protection laws and environmental regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Supplier will retain access to diagnostics, telemetric data and analytics generated by the Product. The data should be uploaded to Supplier’s Firebase server. A server interface will be embedded within the software package provided by the Supplier. Distributor will maintain Supplier’s interface to the server and access to such data within the Product; provided that the data and analytics to be received by the Supplier will attempt to comply with privacy and other laws.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'The data shall be uploaded to Supplier’s Firebase server in a timely manner' to 'The data should be uploaded to Supplier’s Firebase server' weakens the requirement of timely uploading. Also, changing 'shall, in all cases, not be in violation of any applicable privacy or other law' to 'will attempt to comply with privacy and other laws' introduces an element of discretion in complying with privacy laws, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the US, which requires strict data protection.",

                "original_text": "Reseller shall ensure that the Products are delivered with appropriate information and documentation, and shall not make any changes to the Products or to the packaging or labeling thereof, or to the legal documents included in the Products’ packages, without Supplier’s prior written consent (subject to the right of the Reseller to make changes to such materials as are described in Section 2.4). Reseller shall ensure traceability of the delivered Products.",

Reseller will endeavor to ensure traceability of the delivered Products.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Reseller shall ensure' to 'Reseller should try to ensure' and 'Reseller shall ensure traceability' to 'Reseller will endeavor to ensure traceability' makes it non-compulsory to ensure appropriate information and traceability of product delivery. The added phrase 'with reasonable justification' introduces subjectivity and makes it more difficult to prove a violation of regulation because it now depends on an interpretation of what amounts to 'reasonable justification.' This can impact compliance with FDA regulations related to product labeling and traceability if the products are medical devices.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The relevant assignee Party shall have the sole responsibility, at its sole cost and expense, to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with the appropriate Governmental Authorities as required to record the transfer of any registrations or applications of Honeywell IP or SpinCo IP that is allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, and the relevant assignor Party hereby consents to such recordation.",
                "changed_text": "The relevant assignee Party shall endeavor to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and any other forms or documents with Governmental Authorities as deemed necessary to record the transfer of Honeywell IP or SpinCo IP that is allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable, and the relevant assignor Party consents to such recordation.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall have the sole responsibility' to 'shall endeavor' and 'as required' to 'as deemed necessary' introduces ambiguity, potentially conflicting with requirements for IP transfer recordation, which typically requires a clear and mandatory obligation. In many jurisdictions, including the US, failure to properly record IP transfers can affect ownership and enforcement rights.",

                "changed_text": "In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties may use reasonable efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take actions, and to do things, considered necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use reasonable best efforts' to 'may use reasonable efforts' makes the obligation discretionary. Replacing 'reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and agreements' with 'considered necessary' further weakens the obligation and removes the link to legal and contractual requirements. In Delaware, where both companies are incorporated, this would create significant uncertainty regarding the duties of the parties, particularly if specific actions are required by law to effectuate the IP transfer.",

                "changed_text": "Honeywell will, at its discretion, endeavor to give notice to SpinCo of potentially unauthorized use or infringement of the SpinCo IP of which it becomes aware, possibly for a period after the Distribution Date.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will promptly give notice' with 'will, at its discretion, endeavor to give notice' makes the notification of IP infringement discretionary rather than mandatory. Changing 'actual or threatened, unauthorized use or infringement' to 'potentially unauthorized use or infringement' introduces uncertainty about the level of evidence required for notification. Altering 'in each case for a period of five (5) years' to 'possibly for a period' removes a clear temporal boundary, making the duration of this obligation ambiguous. This ambiguity could conflict with requirements to diligently protect IP assets, as failing to promptly notify SpinCo of infringement hinders their ability to defend their IP.",

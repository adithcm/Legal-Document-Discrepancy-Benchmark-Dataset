                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to present each Content Item in its entirety, barring unforeseen technical limitations.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'barring unforeseen technical limitations' introduces ambiguity and could allow for modifications or deletions under vaguely defined circumstances. This weakens the original obligation. This is because it allows for discretion on what could be unforeseen technical limitations that is in contradiction of copyright law which protects the content in its entirety.",

These policies should generally address use of the Licensee Site and Related Media, including the Licensed Content, and should be reasonable.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall have in effect and maintain' with 'will attempt to maintain' weakens the obligation to have specific policies. Removing the condition that the policies must be reasonably acceptable to Licensor gives Licensee complete discretion. This creates ambiguity around the necessary maintenance of a privacy policy, potentially conflicting with the Washington Privacy Act (WPA) and other privacy legislations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall update promptly upon receipt' to 'will attempt to update in a timely manner after notification' introduces ambiguity. 'Timely manner' is subjective, and 'attempt' weakens the obligation. The weakening of the obligation to update the licensed content promptly can be viewed as a violation of the Lanham Act, as outdated information could potentially mislead consumers, thereby failing to accurately represent the content's source or nature.",

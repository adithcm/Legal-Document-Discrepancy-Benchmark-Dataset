                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "LICENSOR shall make a first delivery of Content to plan_b within 14 days after the signing of this Agreement unless separately agreed between the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "LICENSOR should endeavor to deliver Content to plan_b within a reasonable timeframe after the signing of this Agreement, subject to resource availability.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the obligation by changing 'shall' to 'should endeavor', replacing a specific timeframe (14 days) with the vague 'reasonable timeframe,' and introducing the condition of 'resource availability.' This ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce a timely delivery, potentially contradicting contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding definiteness and clarity of terms. Also, UCC Article 2, if 'Content' is considered 'goods,' requires specific terms for delivery.",

                "changed_text": "plan_b may provide LICENSOR with a summary report of End User activity, if such information is readily accessible. The format and timing of the report are subject to plan_b's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This significantly weakens the obligation by changing 'shall provide' to 'may provide,' making the reporting discretionary. Replacing 'detailed written record' with 'summary report' reduces the specificity of the required information. Removing the requirement to include 'each distribution channel' further limits the information provided. Finally, stating that format and timing are 'subject to plan_b's discretion' introduces substantial ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult, violating requirements for adequate accounting practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "General accounting principles and contract law requirements for good faith and fair dealing, as it allows for potentially inadequate reporting.",

                "original_text": "LICENSOR warrants that Content does not infringe an intellectual property right enforceable in the agreed country of delivery or use. LICENSOR indemnifies and holds harmless plan_b against all claims that Content infringes any of the above mentioned rights of a third Party. LICENSOR shall pay all damages awarded in a trial to a third Party.",
                "changed_text": "LICENSOR believes that the Content, to the best of its knowledge, does not infringe upon any intellectual property rights. LICENSOR will consider indemnifying plan_b against claims of infringement, subject to available legal resources. LICENSOR will explore options for covering damages awarded in a trial, if deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This severely weakens the warranty and indemnification by changing 'warrants' to 'believes...to the best of its knowledge,' introducing a subjective element. Replacing 'indemnifies and holds harmless' with 'will consider indemnifying...subject to available legal resources' makes the indemnification obligation conditional and uncertain. Changing 'shall pay' to 'will explore options...if deemed appropriate' creates further ambiguity and reduces the likelihood of actual compensation for infringement, contradicting the intended purpose of IP protection clauses.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles relating to warranties and indemnification, particularly regarding intellectual property rights. It also could be seen as a violation of German IP law, since PLAN_B is located in Germany.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Developer will register a WeChat Official Account on behalf of VAL, which has access to all advanced APIs for the development of WeChat Online Duesey Coffee Store in P.R.China.",
                "changed_text": "Developer will attempt to register a WeChat Official Account on behalf of VAL, potentially providing access to some APIs for development.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will register' to 'will attempt to register' weakens the obligation. Similarly, saying 'potentially providing access to some APIs' introduces uncertainty, violating the implied obligation to secure full API access required for project functionality. This introduces ambiguity around a clearly defined requirement and could lead to a failure to achieve the purpose of the contract.",

                "original_text": "Developer shall ensure the app is technically compliant to WeChat’s App guidelines, and VAL’s business compliance. Being Developer of the project, Developer will be responsible and liable for the product’s business compliance with WeChat Mini Program and Payment guidelines.",
                "changed_text": "Developer will endeavor to keep the app in general alignment with WeChat’s guidelines and VAL's business needs. The developer may assist with business compliance of the app to the extent they deem reasonable.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall ensure' with 'will endeavor to keep in general alignment' significantly reduces the developer's responsibility for compliance. The phrase 'to the extent they deem reasonable' makes the compliance obligation subjective and unenforceable, conflicting with the need to comply with regulatory guidelines, which mandate strict adherence. It introduces a non-compliance risk with both WeChat and potentially Chinese law if the 'endeavor' is not sufficient.",

                "changed_text": "Intellectual Property during the project will generally be owned by VAL, and Developer will aim to transfer it upon project completion and VAL's substantial fulfillment of commercial obligations.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'is owned by' with 'will generally be owned' introduces doubt about the ownership of intellectual property. Changing 'will be turned over' to 'will aim to transfer it' weakens the obligation. Substituting 'fulfillment' with 'substantial fulfillment' creates ambiguity about the extent of commercial obligations required for the IP transfer. This contradicts the clear transfer of rights typically expected and required in software development agreements. This ambiguity makes it unclear when the IP transfer obligation is triggered.",

                "original_text": "The parties agree to modify the Agreement as follows:\n1. EXTENSION OF TERM: The first paragraph of Section 4 of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:\n “TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the “Term”); provided,\nhowever, that with respect to each Property, including Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and\nIce Age II, all right and licenses granted herein will continue in full force and effect until March 31, 2008.”",
                "changed_text": "The parties may consider modifications to the Agreement as follows:\n1. EXTENSION OF TERM: The first paragraph of Section 4 of the Agreement may be updated with language similar to the following:\n “TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and may expire sometime around December 31, 2006 (the “Term”); provided,\nhowever, that with respect to each Property, including Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and\nIce Age II, all right and licenses granted herein could potentially continue in effect until approximately March 31, 2008.”",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the term and extension of the agreement. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'may consider', 'may be updated,' 'sometime around,' and 'approximately,' which weakens the legal obligation and creates uncertainty about the term's actual expiration date.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - Creates uncertainty in contract enforcement, which is a violation in most jurisdictions. Because this agreement involves intellectual property, the ambiguity around the term could also violate copyright laws by creating uncertainty around the duration of the license.",

                "changed_text": "NOTICE PROVISION: The notice information for Licensee in Section 17(a) of the Agreement may be updated, possibly replacing “Paul Zuzelo”\nwith “General Counsel”, and the email address for Paul Zuzelo might be deleted.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a specific change to the notice provision. The modified text makes the change discretionary by using 'may be updated' and 'might be deleted.' This creates ambiguity about whether the notice provision has been correctly updated and if legal notices will reach the correct party. If the agreement is in California, for instance, failure to provide proper notice could have legal ramifications.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Notice provisions are material terms, therefore this perturbation introduces an issue as a material breach of contract. California Civil Code Section 1565 defines consent requires the parties to understand the material terms.",

                "changed_text": "Except as herein possibly amended or potentially modified by this Amendment, the Agreement in other respects is assumed to be ratified\nand may continue in effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the agreement is ratified and continues in full force, except for explicitly amended sections. The modified version uses 'possibly amended,' 'potentially modified,' 'assumed to be ratified,' and 'may continue,' weakening the assertion and creating uncertainty about the agreement's validity and enforceability, leading to ambiguity.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the PRC, without regard to conflicts of law principles.",
                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be generally guided by the laws of the PRC, with some consideration given to conflicts of law principles as deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be governed' to 'shall be generally guided' introduces ambiguity regarding which specific laws apply and to what extent. Adding 'with some consideration...as deemed appropriate' makes the application of conflicts of law principles discretionary, weakening the binding nature of PRC law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China - Article 126 states that contracts involving foreign elements shall be governed by Chinese law unless otherwise provided by law. The original text adheres to this principle, but the modified text creates uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement generally represents the agreement between the parties, and modification can be considered through mutual discussion.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'complete, integrated, and entire agreement' with 'generally represents the agreement,' it suggests that there might be other understandings or agreements not explicitly included. By replacing 'may not be modified except in writing signed by the parties' to 'modification can be considered through mutual discussion' this creates uncertainty about the required formality and enforceability of modifications, going against standard contract law principles of 'no oral modification' clauses.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China - Article 11 states that contracts can be in written or oral form unless the law specifies otherwise. The original text provides a stricter requirement of written form, whereas the change makes that specific requirement vague, potentially unenforceable, and in conflict with what was originally contracted.",

                "changed_text": "Beijing SINA and SINA Leju hope that, upon the execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement will terminate and be of limited further effect, and it is generally understood that no provisions of the Original Agreement should survive such termination.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree that...shall terminate' with 'hope that...will terminate' weakens the commitment to terminate the agreement. Changing 'be of no further force or effect' to 'be of limited further effect' introduces uncertainty. Similarly, changing 'for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions...survive' to 'it is generally understood that no provisions...should survive' softens the finality of the termination and uses the ambiguous language 'should'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China - Article 91, which discusses circumstances for termination of contracts, implies a definitive end to contractual obligations upon termination. The changed text's ambiguity undermines this principle of clear termination.",

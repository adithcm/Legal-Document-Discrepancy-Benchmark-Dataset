                "changed_text": "Consistent with Paragraph 11(b) of the Agreement all music possibly developed and used loosely in connection with the “IN HER SHOES” Wireless Product may be considered as owned exclusively by Fox.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguity regarding the ownership of music developed for the Wireless Product. Replacing 'shall be owned' with 'may be considered as owned' makes the ownership uncertain. The terms 'possibly developed' and 'loosely in connection' weaken the obligations for music ownership, creating potential disputes over intellectual property rights. This could be seen as a violation of intellectual property law which requires specific information when claiming ownership.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee will attempt to develop and distribute some Wireless Products arguably related to the property “ICE AGE 2”: (i) Possibly a Java Game; (ii) A Java Application (‘Screensaver’) if convenient; (iii) Maybe some MMS; (iv) Several Wallpapers; (v) and a few Voicetones (“ICE AGE 2 Wireless Products”) in a few of the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, with Portuguese, Greek, Dutch and Swedish to be considered if convenient.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce significant ambiguity by replacing mandatory language ('shall develop and distribute') with discretionary language ('will attempt to develop and distribute'). Quantifiers such as '1' and 'up to' are replaced with vague terms like 'possibly a', 'if convenient', 'maybe some', 'several', and 'a few,' which do not establish clear obligations for the number or type of Wireless Products to be developed and distributed. This weakens the enforceability of the contract and creates uncertainty about the licensee's responsibilities, contradicting contract law requirements for definiteness.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity regarding the payment obligation. Replacing 'shall pay' with 'may consider paying' makes the payment discretionary, rather than mandatory. 'Approximate,' 'around,' and 'sometime around' introduce vagueness regarding the amount and timing of the payment, weakening the enforceability of this clause. This contradicts general contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms for payment obligations.",

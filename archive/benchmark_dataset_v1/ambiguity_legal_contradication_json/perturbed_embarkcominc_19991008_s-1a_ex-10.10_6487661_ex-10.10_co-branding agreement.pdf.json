                "original_text": "Following the development thereof, Snap shall use commercially reasonable efforts to post and maintain the Co-Branded Pages on the Snap Web Site. Snap may from time to time, in consultation with Sponsor, update and modify the Co-Branded Pages but may not change Sponsor content or Sponsor Brand Features, or do anything else with them, without Sponsor's prior written consent.",
                "changed_text": "Following the development thereof, Snap will endeavor to post and maintain the Co-Branded Pages on the Snap Web Site, provided internal resources allow. Snap may, at its discretion, update and modify the Co-Branded Pages but is not obligated to prevent changes to Sponsor content or Sponsor Brand Features without Sponsor's expressed discontent.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will endeavor to post...provided internal resources allow,' making the obligation to post and maintain Co-Branded Pages conditional and less enforceable. The phrase 'at its discretion' makes updates and modifications optional, and 'is not obligated to prevent changes...without Sponsor's expressed discontent' implies a lack of proactive protection for Sponsor content, weakening Snap's responsibilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Introduces an ambiguity that weakens the original obligation and can lead to disputes over whether Snap fulfilled its contractual obligations, thus potentially violating contract law principles related to good faith and reasonable efforts.",

In addition, Sponsor will perform those specific promotional and marketing services specified on Exhibit D.",
                "changed_text": "Commencing upon the date of this Agreement and thereafter throughout the Term Sponsor will consider opportunities to promote and market Snap and the Snap Web Site as deemed appropriate. In addition, Sponsor will aim to provide some of the promotional and marketing services mentioned in Exhibit D.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces 'will use its commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will consider opportunities...as deemed appropriate,' making the promotional obligation discretionary. Replacing 'will perform those specific promotional and marketing services' with 'will aim to provide some of the promotional and marketing services mentioned' makes the specific performance described in Exhibit D non-mandatory and vague.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - The change transforms a binding obligation into a discretionary action, which could be interpreted as a breach of contract due to the lack of a definite agreement on marketing efforts, violating contract law principles requiring clear and enforceable promises.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires measures 'consistent with those taken to protect its own' information or 'at least reasonable measures.' The modified text removes the 'at a minimum' and 'at least reasonable measures' clauses, stating the party 'may take measures they find suitable', creating ambiguity regarding the level of protection required. Furthermore, there is no obligation that requires a reasonable standard to be upheld in their action.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade Secret Law - The ambiguous wording related to confidential information protection could violate trade secret laws, which mandate reasonable measures to protect trade secrets. The new clause could be interpreted as allowing insufficient protection, thereby risking trade secret misappropriation if the implemented measures are inadequate.",

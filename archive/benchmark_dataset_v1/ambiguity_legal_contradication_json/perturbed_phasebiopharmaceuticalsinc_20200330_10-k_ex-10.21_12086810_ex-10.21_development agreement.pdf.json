                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party will conduct due diligence with respect to each Permitted Third Party used by such Party to ensure that such Permitted Third Party can comply with all applicable terms and obligations of this Agreement and Applicable Laws.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should conduct due diligence with respect to each Permitted Third Party used by such Party to ensure that such Permitted Third Party attempts to comply with the terms and obligations of this Agreement and Applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"will conduct due diligence... to ensure that such Permitted Third Party can comply\" to \"should conduct due diligence... to ensure that such Permitted Third Party attempts to comply\" weakens the obligation. The original text requires a guarantee of compliance, the changed text requires due diligence to ensure mere attempt of compliance, not actual compliance. This undermines the enforceability of due diligence and compliance, creating an ambiguous legal obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Due Diligence obligations are weakened, failing to meet the standards of compliance with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, which necessitate stringent and documented due diligence processes.",

                "changed_text": "PB will attempt to oversee the Manufacture of the Product, and PB will generally comply, and PB will encourage that all Permitted Third Parties of PB comply, with Applicable Laws with respect to the analysis, storage, handling, disposal and transfer of the Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly stipulates that 'PB will materially comply' and 'PB will require that all Permitted Third Parties of PB materially comply' with all Applicable Laws. The revised text weakens this obligation by saying that PB 'will generally comply' and 'will encourage that all Permitted Third Parties of PB comply,' which does not guarantee compliance and is ambiguous, leading to legal uncertainty and potential non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards and regulations under the FFDCA, as well as the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). These regulations require strict adherence and comprehensive controls over the manufacturing, analysis, storage, handling, disposal, and transfer of pharmaceutical products, not just a general attempt or encouragement of compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text is mandatory and specific, stating 'Each Party will comply...' and '...will be solely responsible for ensuring...' This is replaced with weaker, suggestive language: 'Each Party should attempt to comply...' and '...will be generally responsible for suggesting...'. This significantly lowers the standard of compliance and introduces ambiguity about the degree of responsibility and adherence, potentially conflicting with stringent health and safety regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "This weakens the obligations under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. OSHA requires employers to ensure a safe and healthy workplace by implementing and enforcing specific safety standards, providing adequate training, and using appropriate protective equipment. The modified text does not guarantee these.",

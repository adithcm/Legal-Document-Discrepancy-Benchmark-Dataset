                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Joint Venturers shall maintain adequate books and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Joint Venturers should endeavor to maintain books and records of the Joint Venture activities and affairs. The specifics of such record keeping will be determined at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall maintain' to 'should endeavor to maintain' and adding 'at their discretion', the obligation to maintain adequate books and records becomes vague and discretionary. This weakens the requirement for accurate financial record-keeping.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory' with 'will be addressed as the Joint Venturers find reasonably agreeable at the time' introduces ambiguity regarding how debts will be handled, potentially delaying or avoiding full repayment, and provides no objective standard for what is 'reasonably agreeable'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania's Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), and general contract law which requires debts to be settled.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will obtain any licenses deemed by the Joint Venturers to add value' to 'may, if they see fit, attempt to obtain licenses, that may add value' makes obtaining necessary licenses completely discretionary. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and the purpose of the joint venture, which relies on proper licensing.",

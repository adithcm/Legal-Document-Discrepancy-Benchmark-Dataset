                "original_text": "Heritage and Jasper will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to production of the Products, including without limitation, the laws and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), United States Public Health Service (“PHS”), and any and all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement and 21 C.F.R. Part 110 which is entitled “Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing or Holding Human Food” and as it may be amended from time-to-time.",
                "changed_text": "Heritage and Jasper will attempt to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to production of the Products, including the laws and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), United States Public Health Service (“PHS”), and all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Heritage estimates that the Products will be released free from defects in workmanship and will be manufactured in general accordance with this Agreement and 21 C.F.R. Part 110 which is entitled “Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing or Holding Human Food” and as it may be amended from time-to-time.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will comply' to 'will attempt to comply' makes the obligation non-mandatory. Replacing 'shall be released' with 'estimates that the Products will be released' weakens the warranty regarding defects. Also, changing 'shall be manufactured in accordance' to 'will be manufactured in general accordance' creates further ambiguity and discretion, potentially leading to non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Heritage shall endeavor to perform, and shall encourage Jasper to perform, a documented inspection of all trailers before loading to generally confirm they are free of significant visible contamination or odors and are reasonably fit for use with food products.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall perform' with 'shall endeavor to perform' and 'shall ensure' with 'shall encourage,' making the inspection discretionary. Additionally, changing 'confirm they are free of any visible contamination or odors' to 'generally confirm they are free of significant visible contamination or odors' introduces ambiguity about the level of cleanliness required and what constitutes 'significant,' creating uncertainty and weakening food safety standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 C.F.R. Part 110 - Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing, or Holding Human Food. This regulation requires strict adherence to cleanliness and safety protocols, not just an attempt to do so.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will keep' to 'will endeavor to keep' and 'will ensure' to 'will encourage' makes the record-keeping obligation less stringent. Altering 'complete and accurate records' to 'reasonably complete records' introduces ambiguity about the required level of detail and accuracy. Substituting 'Such records shall include' with 'Such records should generally include' weakens the requirement for specific records. Finally, replacing 'shall allow' with 'may allow' makes access to records discretionary, conflicting with thorough auditing requirements.",

                "original_text": "Licensee will provide Licensor with copies of any materials bearing any of Licensor's marks as requested by Licensor from time to time. If Licensee’s use of any of Licensor’s marks, or if any material bearing such marks, does not comply with the then-current trademark usage policies provided in writing by Licensor, Licensee will promptly remedy such deficiencies upon receipt of written notice of such deficiencies from Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will endeavor to provide Licensor with copies of materials bearing Licensor's marks if reasonably practical. If Licensee’s use of any of Licensor’s marks, or if any material bearing such marks, does not generally comply with trademark usage policies, Licensee will consider addressing deficiencies after notification.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on the Licensee to provide materials and promptly remedy deficiencies. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'endeavor to,' 'reasonably practical,' 'generally comply,' and 'consider addressing,' making the obligation less stringent and more discretionary. This reduces the enforceability of trademark compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Throughout the Term, Licensee should attempt to adhere to suggested quality standards and style guides, taking into account Licensor's expressed preferences concerning the Licensed Property's usage. Compliance will be reviewed periodically.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear obligation for the Licensee to comply with quality standards and specifications. The modified text weakens this obligation by using terms like 'should attempt,' 'suggested,' and 'expressed preferences,' making compliance discretionary. It replaces the definite 'shall comply' with a weaker 'should attempt,' thus the adherence and the action for compliance are not required. This introduces ambiguity and reduces the Licensee's accountability.",

Zynga shall permit such records to be examined by authorized representatives of WPT, including such independent auditors as WPT may designate, during usual business hours, with advance notice, to verify to the extent necessary the Royalties paid hereunder, and WPT and its representatives shall use reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions to Zynga’s business.",

Zynga may allow authorized representatives of WPT to review these records during mutually convenient times, with notification provided as feasible, to generally assess the Royalties paid. WPT representatives will aim to limit disruptions.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates Zynga to keep 'full, complete and accurate books' and 'shall permit' examination. The modified text softens this by saying Zynga 'will maintain records', it does not say if this will be accurate or complete. The 'may allow' and 'mutually convenient times' creates ambiguity around the audit rights and the use of 'generally assess' reduces the scope of the audit. These changes weaken WPT's ability to verify royalties and ensure compliance.",

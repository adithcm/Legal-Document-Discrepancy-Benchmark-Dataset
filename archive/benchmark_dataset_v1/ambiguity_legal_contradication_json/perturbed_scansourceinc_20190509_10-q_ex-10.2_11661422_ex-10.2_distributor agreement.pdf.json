                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor’s inventory to support sales.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will endeavor to maintain some stock in Distributor’s inventory, as it deems feasible, to potentially support sales.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a relatively clear obligation to maintain a 30-day stock. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will endeavor,' making the effort level subjective. Furthermore, 'some stock' replaces 'thirty (30) days of stock,' creating uncertainty about the required inventory level. The addition of 'as it deems feasible' introduces further discretion, allowing the distributor to decide how much stock to keep based on its own judgment. This contradicts standard supply chain management practices and could create scenarios where ScanSource isn't prepared to fill demand, thus violating the implicit understanding of a distributor agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring 'good faith' and 'reasonable efforts' which is undermined by the vague language, potentially leading to disputes about the intended level of commitment and violating implicit obligations within a distribution agreement.",

                "changed_text": "Xplore will attempt to provide Distributor with a means for confirming proof of delivery for Xplore Product shipments should the Distributor request it. Xplore might provide packing slips for shipments, resources permitting.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Xplore 'shall provide' both a means for confirming proof of delivery and packing slips. The modification replaces 'shall provide' with 'will attempt to provide' and 'might provide,' introducing ambiguity and making these obligations discretionary. The added condition 'resources permitting' gives Xplore an easy way to avoid providing packing slips. This change affects the distributor's ability to track shipments, manage inventory, and handle customer inquiries, potentially leading to disputes and supply chain issues. It is a violation of general contractual agreements to assist in the delivery and receipt of goods.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring reasonable cooperation and support for the performance of the agreement. The lack of mandatory proof of delivery creates potential breaches of these principles.",

                "changed_text": "Purchase orders placed by Distributor, and invoices sent by Xplore, may be subject to the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement. Additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice might be considered.",
                "explanation": "The original text states purchase orders 'shall be governed'. The modified text weakens this by stating that purchase orders 'may be subject to' the Addendum and Distribution Agreement terms, making the governing nature optional. Additionally, the original text clearly states that 'any additional or different terms...shall have no effect.' The modified text replaces this with 'might be considered' which opens the door for these terms to be accepted, creating potential contradictions and legal confusion. This change undermines the enforceability of the Distribution Agreement and Addendum.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic principles of contract law, where clear and unambiguous terms are essential for enforceability. Allowing potential consideration of conflicting terms introduces uncertainty and undermines the validity of the agreement.",

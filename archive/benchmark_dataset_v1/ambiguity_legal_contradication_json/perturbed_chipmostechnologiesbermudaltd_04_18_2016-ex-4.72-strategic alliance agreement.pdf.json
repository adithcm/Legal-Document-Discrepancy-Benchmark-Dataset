                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide immediate assistance to, and actively cooperate with, the other Party, to implement this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should consider providing assistance to, and contemplate cooperating with, the other Party, to implement this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates an obligation of \"reasonable best efforts\" to assist and cooperate. The modified text replaces this with \"should consider\" and \"contemplate cooperating,\" which are significantly weaker and more discretionary. This weakens the commitment to the strategic alliance and makes enforcement difficult, potentially violating the intended spirit of the agreement under Taiwanese contract law, which generally expects parties to act in good faith to fulfill agreements.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (“Dispute Notice”) to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties are encouraged to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If negotiation is unsuccessful, each Party may consider issuing a Dispute Notice to the other Party, potentially including the nature of the dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve such dispute through negotiation, each Party might have the option to submit such dispute to an arbitration center.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the dispute resolution process significantly. The original text mandates negotiation and establishes a clear right to issue a Dispute Notice and proceed to arbitration after a specific timeframe. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'are encouraged,' 'may consider,' and 'might have the option,' making each step discretionary. This undermines the binding nature of the dispute resolution mechanism and could be seen as a bad faith effort to avoid arbitration, conflicting with principles of contract law in Taiwan that emphasize fulfilling the intent of the agreement.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Parties agree that the Parties will not disclose information in connection with the execution, existence, content, and performance of this Agreement to any third party before the Parties have made an announcement to the public pursuant to Section 3.11 of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties will endeavor to avoid disclosing information in connection with the execution, existence, content, and performance of this Agreement to third parties before a public announcement, but may do so if circumstances warrant.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"will not disclose\" to \"will endeavor to avoid disclosing, but may do so if circumstances warrant\", this clause becomes ambiguous and unenforceable. The phrase 'endeavor to avoid' is weaker than a prohibition. Adding the clause 'but may do so if circumstances warrant' provides a broad, undefined exception that negates the original intent of confidentiality. The original text makes it clear to not disclose before public announcement which makes it consistent with Taiwanese Security Regulations. The modified text contradicts Taiwanese regulations regarding information disclosure related to strategic alliances, as it allows for potentially selective and untimely disclosures without defining what circumstances are 'warranted', potentially harming shareholders and violating regulatory transparency requirements.",

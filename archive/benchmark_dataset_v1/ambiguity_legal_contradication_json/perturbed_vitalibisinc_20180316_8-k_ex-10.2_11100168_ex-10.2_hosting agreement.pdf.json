                "original_text": "VOTOCAST shall use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of Licensee and Licensee Users and the content\nthat is transmitted through the Services. VOTOCAST will only access and disclose information as necessary to comply with applicable laws and\ngovernment orders or requests, to provide the Services, to operate or maintain its systems or to protect itself or Licensee Users. In all such\ninstances. VOTOCAST shall provide prior written notice to Licensee of not less than three (3) business days prior to accessing or disclosing such\ninformation so that Licensee may have an opportunity to dispute or restrict such disclosure. Licensee acknowledges, however, that Licensee and\nLicensee Users' content will not pass through nor be stored in a segregated or separate physical location from which VOTOCAST'S other users\ncontent will be transmitted or stored.",
                "changed_text": "VOTOCAST will endeavor to protect the privacy of Licensee and Licensee Users and the content\nthat is transmitted through the Services. VOTOCAST may access and disclose information when it is believed necessary to comply with laws and\ngovernment orders or requests, or to provide the Services, operate or maintain its systems or protect itself or Licensee Users. In all such\ninstances, VOTOCAST will attempt to provide notice to Licensee prior to accessing or disclosing such\ninformation. Licensee acknowledges that Licensee and\nLicensee Users' content will not necessarily pass through nor be stored in a segregated or separate physical location from which VOTOCAST'S other users\ncontent will be transmitted or stored.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will endeavor to protect,' the obligation to protect privacy becomes less stringent. Replacing 'will only access and disclose information as necessary to comply with applicable laws' with 'may access and disclose information when it is believed necessary' introduces discretion, potentially conflicting with privacy laws like **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** that mandate strict data protection measures and limit data access to specific, justifiable purposes. Additionally, changing 'shall provide prior written notice' to 'will attempt to provide notice' weakens the notification requirement, making it non-mandatory and less compliant with regulations requiring transparency in data handling.",

                "original_text": "Licensee hereby agrees that it will offer, access, and make the Services available to Licensee Users pursuant to a terms\nof use agreement (\"Terms of Use\") adapted to local laws and languages no less protective of VOTOCAST'S rights, in all material respects, than the\nterms of this Agreement. Licensee agrees to obtain acceptance by provable electronic means from each Licensee User of the Terms of Use prior to\nsuch Licensee User's initial use of the Services.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will aim to offer, access, and make the Services available to Licensee Users pursuant to a terms\nof use agreement (“Terms of Use”) adapted to local laws and languages. Licensee will try to obtain acceptance from each Licensee User of the Terms of Use prior to\nsuch Licensee User's initial use of the Services.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Licensee hereby agrees that it will' to 'Licensee will aim to,' the obligation to offer Services under a compliant Terms of Use becomes aspirational rather than mandatory. Replacing 'agrees to obtain acceptance' with 'will try to obtain acceptance' makes user agreement discretionary, which contradicts requirements under the **California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)** that require clear and affirmative consent from users regarding data collection and usage.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'exclusive jurisdiction and venue shall be' to 'jurisdiction and venue may be' and removing 'exclusive', the clause no longer mandates that all legal actions must be brought in California courts. This introduces ambiguity, as it suggests other venues might be permissible, undermining the original intent of establishing a clear legal jurisdiction, conflicting with principles of contract law which values certainty, creating potential issues if another state law finds issue with the ambiguity, and causes disputes to be litigated somewhere else.",

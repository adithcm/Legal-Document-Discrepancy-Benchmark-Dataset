                "original_text": "In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of the Licensee’s business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of Licensee’s business as of the Effective Date. The Licensee further agrees to use the Licensed Mark in accordance with such quality standards as may be reasonably established by Licensor and communicated to the Licensee from time to time in writing, or as may be agreed to by Licensor and the Licensee from time to time in writing.",
                "changed_text": "In order to perhaps preserve some value of the Licensed Mark, Licensee generally agrees to try to maintain a quality of the Licensee’s business and the operation thereof somewhat similar to the standards prevailing in the operation of Licensee’s business as of the Effective Date. The Licensee further agrees to use the Licensed Mark generally in accordance with quality standards that the Licensee believes are appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation to maintain quality by introducing vague terms like 'perhaps', 'generally agrees', 'try to maintain', 'somewhat similar', and 'Licensee believes are appropriate'. This makes the quality control obligation subjective and difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lanham Act (15 U.S. Code § 1114) - Quality Control Requirements for Trademark Licenses. This section holds licensees accountable for maintaining consistent quality, and these modifications undermine enforcement of the brand’s integrity. The modifications contradict the core requirement of the Lanham Act.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business and shall notify Licensor of any action that must be taken by Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee agrees to attempt compliance with laws, rules, regulations, and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business and may notify Licensor of potential actions that could be taken by Licensee to potentially comply with such laws, rules, regulations, or requirements.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'agrees to attempt compliance' makes the legal obligation non-mandatory. Replacing 'shall notify' with 'may notify' makes notification discretionary. This undermines the obligation to adhere to legal requirements, creating ambiguity and potential non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws governing business operations, marketing, and promotion. The ambiguity contradicts the clear requirements of laws like the CAN-SPAM Act for marketing or state consumer protection laws, which mandate compliance, not just an attempt.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee may, to a reasonable extent, cooperate with Licensor in the prosecution, defense, or settlement of such actions, proceedings, or claims, if Licensee deems it necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates cooperation. The change makes cooperation discretionary ('may') and introduces the subjective qualifier 'to a reasonable extent' and 'if Licensee deems it necessary', allowing the Licensee to avoid cooperation based on its own judgment. This creates ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Principles of Trademark Law relating to enforcement and defense. While not a direct statutory violation, failing to fully cooperate in defending the licensed mark could be seen as a breach of implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in the context of protecting the trademark's validity, which is critical under trademark law.",

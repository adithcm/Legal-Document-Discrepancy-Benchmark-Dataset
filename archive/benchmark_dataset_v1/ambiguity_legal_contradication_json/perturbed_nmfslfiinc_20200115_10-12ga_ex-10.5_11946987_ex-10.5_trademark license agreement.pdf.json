            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, the Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of its business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of the Licensor’s and the Licensee’s businesses as of the date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, the Licensee will endeavor to maintain the quality of its business and its operation thereof, considering prevailing standards.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains' with 'will endeavor to maintain, considering' significantly weakening the obligation. 'Endeavor' is less definitive, and 'considering' introduces subjectivity, undermining the original intent to maintain specific quality standards. This creates ambiguity about the required level of quality maintenance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Lanham Act, which requires trademark licensees to maintain quality control over the goods or services offered under the licensed mark to avoid consumer deception.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business and that it shall notify the Licensor of any action that must be taken by the Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark should generally comply with the relevant laws, rules, regulations and requirements of governmental bodies in the Territory or elsewhere, and will inform the Licensor if, in its own assessment, there are significant actions the Licensee considers essential to take to comply with laws, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall comply' to 'should generally comply', and adding 'in its own assessment', the obligation to adhere to all applicable laws becomes discretionary. This undermines the clear legal requirement to comply with all applicable laws, introducing ambiguity and subjectivity. The decision to inform the licensor is now based on Licensee's own assessment of what is 'essential' creating further ambiguity about what constitutes mandatory compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial services, including securities laws and advertising regulations, which require strict compliance.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, the Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that the Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with the Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by the Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "changed_text": "For approximately twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, the Licensee will consider specifying on some public-facing materials that it is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark and is no longer associated with the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall specify' with 'will consider specifying' makes the post-termination notice requirement optional. The term 'approximately' introduces vagueness to the duration, and removing the 'prominent place and prominent typeface' clause eliminates clear guidelines. Furthermore, removing the reference to the Licensor's discretion in determining necessary notice weakens the Licensor's control. This creates uncertainty about the Licensee's obligation to disassociate itself from the Licensed Mark after termination.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common law principles of trademark abandonment, which require trademark owners to take steps to prevent consumer confusion after a license is terminated. Failure to clearly disassociate may lead to consumer confusion.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each party shall comply with all prevailing laws, rules and regulations and obtain all necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the jurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each party shall endeavor to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and to obtain approvals, consents and permits as they deem appropriate for their activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires compliance with 'all prevailing laws.' The modified version uses 'endeavor to comply,' which introduces a weaker, less definite obligation. The phrase 'as they deem appropriate' makes the decision to obtain necessary approvals and permits subjective and discretionary, potentially conflicting with mandatory requirements under Pennsylvania state law and federal laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various Pennsylvania state laws and federal regulations (e.g., environmental, safety, and business licensing regulations) often mandate strict compliance and do not allow for discretionary interpretation of permit requirements.",

                "changed_text": "PaperExchange may explore opportunities to expand its sales force presence, and will consider encouraging its sales force to promote Pulp and Paper Online through possible \"on-the-ground\" activities.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'may explore opportunities,' making the expansion of the sales force optional. Furthermore, 'commit its sales force' is changed to 'consider encouraging its sales force,' weakening the obligation to promote Pulp and Paper Online. This ambiguity could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in Pennsylvania contract law, especially if PaperExchange takes no action to expand its sales force or promote the collaboration.",

The Receiving Party shall notify the Originating Party of its approval or disapproval of such advertising materials as soon as practicable, but in any event within five business days after Receiving Party's receipt thereof. Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such five business day period shall be deemed disapproval of the advertising materials in question.",

The Receiving Party will endeavor to respond to the Originating Party regarding its approval or disapproval of such advertising materials within a reasonable timeframe. Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond may be interpreted as an indication of potential disapproval of the advertising materials.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by removing the 'not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned' clause, giving the Receiving Party potentially unlimited discretion. Replacing 'shall notify...within five business days' with 'will endeavor to respond...within a reasonable timeframe' makes the response timeframe vague and unenforceable. Changing 'shall be deemed disapproval' to 'may be interpreted as an indication of potential disapproval' introduces further uncertainty about the consequences of non-response, potentially conflicting with Pennsylvania's contract law principles that require clarity and certainty.",

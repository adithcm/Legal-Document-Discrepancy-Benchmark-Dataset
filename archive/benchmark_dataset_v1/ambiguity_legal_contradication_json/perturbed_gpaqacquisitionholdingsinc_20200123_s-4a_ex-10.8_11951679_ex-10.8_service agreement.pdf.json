                "original_text": "Constellation will provide, or cause to be provided, all of the Services included in the Products & Services in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, codes, orders, treaties and other requirements of federal/national, state/provincial and local governments and agencies thereof, including but not limited those relating to labor, health, safety and the environment.",
                "changed_text": "Constellation will endeavor to provide, or cause to be provided, all of the Services included in the Products & Services in a manner it reasonably believes complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, codes, orders, treaties and other requirements of federal/national, state/provincial and local governments and agencies thereof, including but not limited those relating to labor, health, safety and the environment.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'in compliance in all material respects' with 'in a manner it reasonably believes complies', the obligation becomes subjective. This introduces ambiguity as it is unclear what standard Constellation must meet to demonstrate 'reasonable belief.' This weakens the guarantee of compliance, potentially leading to violations without clear recourse. The 'endeavor to provide' also weakens the obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change weakens the compliance requirements and could conflict with specific regulations enforced by federal and state agencies such as OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) or the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), which require strict adherence to regulations rather than just a 'reasonable belief' of compliance.",

                "original_text": "Constellation shall, at its own expense, secure and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term (a) insurance coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person’s right of publicity and right of privacy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] per occurrence; and (b) a general liability insurance policy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] in aggregate. The liability limits may be met with any combination of primary and excess or umbrella insurance policy limits. Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance, naming each HOF Entity as an additional insured, evidencing the existence of such insurance policies within ten (10) days after execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Constellation shall, using commercially reasonable efforts, secure and maintain insurance coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person’s right of publicity and right of privacy from a reputable carrier in an amount it deems adequate; and a general liability insurance policy from a similarly reputable carrier. Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance, but the HOF Entities acknowledge that the specific terms and coverage are subject to change based on market conditions.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to maintain specific insurance coverage. Replacing 'shall' with 'using commercially reasonable efforts' and removing the A.M. Best rating requirement introduce ambiguity. Also, removing the specific amount, as well as stating \"amount it deems adequate\" make it a subjective determination. Introducing, \"but the HOF Entities acknowledge that the specific terms and coverage are subject to change based on market conditions.\" makes the original agreement and the assurance of coverage vague and ambigious. This eliminates a clear requirement.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change potentially violates standard business practices and could conflict with requirements in Ohio for adequate insurance coverage to protect against potential liabilities. Additionally, it could violate requirements related to duty of care and negligence if the coverage is inadequate, as the coverage is not guranteed based on specific parameters.",

The HOF Entities and Constellation shall mutually agree on the content of any such press release prior to its publication.",
                "changed_text": "The HOF Entities and Constellation should attempt to consult with each other before issuing any press release or scheduling any press conference or conference call with media members or other third parties with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The HOF Entities and Constellation should endeavor to reach a mutual understanding on the general topic of any such press release prior to its dissemination.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should attempt' and 'shall mutually agree on the content' to 'should endeavor to reach a mutual understanding on the general topic' weakens the obligation to obtain mutual agreement before issuing press releases. It introduces ambiguity by making consultation and agreement non-mandatory, and only pertaining to the \"general topic\".",
                "contradicted_law": "This could be seen as a breach of good faith and fair dealing depending on the context of the press release. If a press release contains false advertising or defamation, the weaker wording could make it harder to hold the issuing party accountable.",

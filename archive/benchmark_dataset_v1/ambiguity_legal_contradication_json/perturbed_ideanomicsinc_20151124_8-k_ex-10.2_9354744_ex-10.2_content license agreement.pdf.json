                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Licensee agrees to display the Titles without material alteration to the content thereof. Licensee may modify or edit the format of the Titles for technical purposes. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Licensee from providing Users with the ability to use the Titles as permitted by law or in a manner for which a license is not required.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will endeavor to display the Titles without unnecessary alteration to the core content. Licensee retains the option to modify or edit the Titles as it sees fit. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Licensee from providing Users with the ability to use the Titles in a way that Licensee believes is permitted.",
                "explanation": "The term 'endeavor to display' weakens the obligation to simply trying. 'Without unnecessary alteration' introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes 'unnecessary' and allows for more subjective modification of the content. 'As it sees fit' gives the Licensee broad discretion to modify and edit the titles without limitations for technical purposes. 'Licensee believes' introduces subjectivity regarding what is legally permitted, rather than adhering to a strict legal standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China and relevant regulations concerning the integrity of works and protection of authors' rights, particularly Article 10 which protects the right of integrity of a work.",

                "original_text": "Licensor will provide Licensee with reasonable assistance in responding to User inquiries regarding the Titles.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor will attempt to provide some assistance to Licensee in responding to certain User inquiries if Licensor deems it appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will provide reasonable assistance' to 'will attempt to provide some assistance' significantly reduces the obligation. Adding 'if Licensor deems it appropriate' makes the provision entirely discretionary, allowing Licensor to decide whether to offer any assistance at all. This introduces uncertainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 4, which requires parties to adhere to the principle of good faith, which is undermined by making assistance purely discretionary.",
                "location": "Section 4(d)"

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Licensor shall give Licensee the first right of negotiation for each Additional Title (i.e., the preferred vendor). Licensor will promptly provide written notice to Licensee in which Licensor lists each Additional Title.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor should consider granting Licensee an opportunity to negotiate for each Additional Title. Licensor may, at its discretion, provide written notice to Licensee if Licensor identifies an Additional Title.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall give...the first right of negotiation' to 'should consider granting...an opportunity to negotiate' significantly weakens the obligation to a suggestion. Replacing 'will promptly provide written notice' with 'may, at its discretion, provide written notice' makes providing notice optional, undermining the licensee's ability to exercise any negotiation rights. It also goes against Article 92 of Contract Law of the People's Republic of China on supplementary terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, specifically principles regarding offer and acceptance, and the good faith requirement in contractual negotiations, as the licensor now has broad discretion not to inform the licensee of opportunities.",

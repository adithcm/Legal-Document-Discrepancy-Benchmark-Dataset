                "changed_text": "Each party acknowledges and agrees that (i) all copyrights and trademarks used in connection herewith that are owned by a party shall generally remain the property of such party; (ii) the other party will endeavor not to acquire or claim any right, title or interest in any such copyright or trademark by virtue of this Agreement; (iii) the other party will try not to contest the validity of all such copyrights and trademarks; and (iv) it will attempt not to incur or create any expenses chargeable to the other party.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by replacing definitive statements like 'shall be and remain' with vague terms such as 'generally remain,' 'endeavor not to acquire,' 'try not to contest,' and 'attempt not to incur.' This makes the obligations unclear and unenforceable, particularly regarding the protection of intellectual property rights. This introduces ambiguity as the ownership and protection of intellectual property is now subject to interpretation.",

This includes the use of the Celebrity Endorsement and the design, development, preparation, cooking, packaging, labeling, distribution, delivery, advertisement, marketing, promotion, offering for sale, sale, or other exploitation of the Products.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will comply' with 'will make commercially reasonable efforts to comply' introduces significant ambiguity. This weakens the commitment to full compliance, allowing for interpretation of what constitutes 'commercially reasonable efforts.' This is an ambiguity that contradicts strict legal and regulatory compliance that's required with business practices.",

Insurance must be obtained from a company reasonably\nacceptable to ABG, in an amount not less than Five Million United States Dollars ($5,000,000 USD) in the aggregate, or PAPA JOHN’S standard\ninsurance policy limits, whichever is greater.",
                "changed_text": "PAPA JOHN’S shall attempt to procure and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, comprehensive general liability insurance (including product liability insurance), to defend and protect the Parties against claims. Insurance should be obtained from a company acceptable to ABG, in an amount approximating Five Million United States Dollars ($5,000,000 USD), or PAPA JOHN’S usual insurance policy limits.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall procure and maintain' with 'shall attempt to procure and maintain', and 'Insurance must be obtained from a company reasonably acceptable to ABG, in an amount not less than Five Million United States Dollars ($5,000,000 USD)' with 'Insurance should be obtained from a company acceptable to ABG, in an amount approximating Five Million United States Dollars ($5,000,000 USD)', the obligation to maintain adequate insurance coverage is weakened, as now those terms become discretionary and subjective. This creates ambiguity regarding the required level of financial protection for both parties. The insurance is now at risk of being too low to be effective.",

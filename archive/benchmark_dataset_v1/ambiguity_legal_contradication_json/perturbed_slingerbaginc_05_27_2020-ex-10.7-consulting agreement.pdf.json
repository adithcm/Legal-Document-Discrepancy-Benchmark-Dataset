                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Consultant will faithfully, honestly and diligently serve the Company and cooperate with the Company and utilize maximum professional skill and care to ensure that all services rendered hereunder are to the satisfaction of the Company, acting reasonably, and the Consultant will provide any other services not specifically mentioned herein, but which by reason of the Consultant’s capability, the Consultant knows or ought to know to be necessary to ensure that the best interests of the Company are maintained.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant will endeavor to serve the Company and cooperate with the Company and utilize professional skill and care to ensure that all services rendered hereunder are generally aligned with the Company's goals, and the Consultant may provide other services if they feel it could potentially benefit the Company.",
                "explanation": "The change from \"faithfully, honestly and diligently serve\" to \"endeavor to serve\" weakens the commitment. The replacement of \"maximum professional skill and care to ensure satisfaction\" with \"generally aligned with the Company's goals\" introduces ambiguity, as 'generally aligned' is subjective and lacks clear performance metrics. Additionally, changing the mandatory provision of 'necessary' services to a discretionary provision of services that 'potentially benefit' the company weakens the Consultant's obligations, allowing them to decide whether or not a service is needed.",

                "changed_text": "The Consultant will consider assuming, obeying, implementing, and executing such duties, directions, responsibilities, procedures, policies, and lawful orders as may be suggested by the Company from time to time.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will assume, obey, implement and execute' to 'will consider assuming, obeying, implementing, and executing' introduces significant ambiguity. It transforms a mandatory obligation into a discretionary one, making it unclear whether the Consultant is actually required to follow the Company's directives. Also the language 'as may be suggested' is not obligatory.",

                "changed_text": "The Consultant’s bonus payment level may be approximately 25% of the annual gross Base Consulting Fee.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will be set at a minimum of 25%' to 'may be approximately 25%' introduces ambiguity regarding the bonus amount. The word 'approximately' makes the 25% figure non-binding, allowing the Company to potentially provide a bonus significantly lower than expected. This can result in a breach of contract dispute due to the vague wording.",

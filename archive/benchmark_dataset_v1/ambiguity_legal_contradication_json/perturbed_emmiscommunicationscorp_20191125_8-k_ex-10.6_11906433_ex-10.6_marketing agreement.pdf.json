                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "During the Term, Licensee shall broadcast on the HD2 Channel the WLIB Programs delivered by Programmer during the Broadcasting Period specified in Section 2 above, subject to the provisions of Section 6 below.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, Licensee will endeavor to broadcast on the HD2 Channel the WLIB Programs delivered by Programmer during the Broadcasting Period specified in Section 2 above, subject to the provisions of Section 6 below.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall broadcast' to 'will endeavor to broadcast' introduces ambiguity regarding the Licensee's obligation. 'Endeavor' suggests an attempt, but does not guarantee compliance. This contradicts the implied obligation to broadcast the programs, and it makes the obligation open to interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "FCC regulations regarding broadcast obligations, which require licensees to operate in the public interest and fulfill programming commitments. An ambiguous promise may not meet this standard.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall conform' to 'should generally conform' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity. 'Generally conform' implies that deviations from FCC rules are acceptable under certain circumstances, contradicting the strict compliance required by the FCC.",
                "contradicted_law": "FCC regulations regarding broadcast content, which require strict adherence to rules concerning indecency, obscenity, and other prohibited content. The word 'generally' leaves room for interpretation that does not align with these regulations.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, Programmer will attempt to cooperate with Licensee as Licensee complies with its political broadcast responsibilities, and will endeavor to supply such information to Licensee when convenient to comply with the political advertising time record keeping, reasonable access, and lowest unit charge requirements of federal law.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall cooperate' to 'will attempt to cooperate' and 'shall supply such information promptly' to 'will endeavor to supply such information when convenient' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. The vague language makes cooperation and information supply discretionary rather than mandatory, contradicting the requirement for prompt compliance by both parties.",

                "original_text": "3.3\tParty B must strictly comply with relevant industry laws, rules and standards promulgated by the State, including, without limitation, the PRC Telecommunications Regulations, Administrative Measures on Internet Information Service, Interim Provisions on the Administration of Internet Publishing, Interim Provisions on the Administration of Internet Websites’ Engaging in News Publication Services, and such other laws, regulations, policies and industry management rules, and shall not distribute and disseminate illegal, unhealthy, reactionary information or advertisement or such other junk information on the Internet.",
                "changed_text": "3.3\tParty B should endeavor to comply with relevant industry laws, rules and standards promulgated by the State, including, without limitation, the PRC Telecommunications Regulations, Administrative Measures on Internet Information Service, Interim Provisions on the Administration of Internet Publishing, Interim Provisions on the Administration of Internet Websites’ Engaging in News Publication Services, and such other laws, regulations, policies and industry management rules, and will try to avoid distributing and disseminating illegal, unhealthy, reactionary information or advertisement or such other junk information on the Internet.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the mandatory compliance requirement by replacing 'must strictly comply' with 'should endeavor to comply', introducing a degree of discretion. Furthermore, replacing 'shall not distribute' with 'will try to avoid distributing' further softens the obligation. This creates ambiguity around Party B's actual commitment to adhering to state regulations regarding information dissemination.",

At the same time, the Parties confirm that Party A shall have the ownership of the user files, and the user files and information shall belong to Party A’s confidential information, for which Party B shall take the confidentiality obligation hereunder; Party B shall not use such information for any purposes other than those agreed herein without authorization, or provide such information to any third party in any manner whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "3.13\tParty B should, where feasible, make available to Party A the network access and authority for business inquiry and cancellation and upon the reasonable request of Party A, may consider providing data/reports on user development, user classification, user habits and business outlook forecasts, and consider conveying to Party A the user files that may be required for management of such business to facilitate the update of Party A’s user data room. At the same time, the Parties acknowledge that Party A aims to maintain ownership of user files, and user files and information may be regarded as Party A’s confidential information, for which Party B will consider maintaining confidentiality; Party B will endeavor not to use such information for purposes other than those agreed herein or provide such information to any third party without explicit authorization.",
                "explanation": "This section weakens the obligation to provide data and maintain confidentiality. Replacing 'shall make available' with 'should, where feasible, make available' introduces uncertainty about the availability of network access. Similarly, 'may provide' becomes 'may consider providing', and 'shall take the confidentiality obligation' becomes 'will consider maintaining confidentiality'. The language regarding not using or providing information to third parties is softened from 'shall not' to 'will endeavor not to'.",

                "changed_text": "5.2\tParty B will aim to provide a customer service system to handle the consultation, claims and complaints by users regarding the application services or contents it provides. This system could include:\n\n\t(1)\tCustomer service call: Intended to be available, where possible, 24 hours a day, some days a week, potentially using service numbers starting with 800 or 4008, and possibly not ordinary in-city numbers or mobile numbers;",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'shall provide' with 'will aim to provide' weakens the obligation to have a customer service system. Changing 'shall include' to 'could include' makes the components of the system optional. The language regarding the customer service call availability is significantly weakened by replacing '24 hours a day, 7 days a week in service' with 'Intended to be available, where possible, 24 hours a day, some days a week' and 'shall be' with 'potentially using' and 'possibly not'.",

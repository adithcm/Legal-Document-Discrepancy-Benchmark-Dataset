                "changed_text": "About will attempt to achieve that number in a timeframe that is deemed practical from the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'commercially reasonable efforts' within 'twelve months'. The revised text uses the vague term 'attempt' and replaces 'twelve months' with 'timeframe that is deemed practical,' making the obligation less defined and easily disputable. This is ambiguous and difficult to enforce, as 'practical' is subjective.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, ebix aims to be the primary integrated online insurance provider in the Channels and Guide Sites listed in Section 3.1  [DEVELOPMENT, OPERATION AND ADMINISTRATIO...] above.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be the exclusive' to 'aims to be the primary' significantly weakens the exclusivity clause. The term 'primary' is ambiguous as it allows for other insurance providers to be present as long as ebix is the 'primary' one, making the exclusivity uncertain and challenging to enforce. The term 'aims' suggests there is no obligation to actually BE the primary integrated online insurance provider, thereby weakening the clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles emphasizing clear and unambiguous terms for exclusivity agreements. The change introduces uncertainty, which could render the clause unenforceable under Illinois or New York law.",

                "changed_text": "If any force majeure event occurs, the affected party should notify the other party when feasible and may attempt to lessen the event's impact.",
                "explanation": "The original requires 'prompt written notice' and 'commercially reasonable efforts' to mitigate a force majeure event. The modified text replaces 'will give' with 'should notify,' making notification optional, replaces 'prompt' with 'when feasible', which is subjective and weakens the obligation. It also dilutes 'commercially reasonable efforts' to 'may attempt', making mitigation efforts discretionary. This makes the force majeure clause less binding and more open to interpretation, undermining the original intention for decisive action.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law requiring clear duties in force majeure clauses. The ambiguity introduced weakens the obligation to mitigate damages, potentially leading to disputes under Illinois or New York law regarding performance during unforeseen circumstances.",

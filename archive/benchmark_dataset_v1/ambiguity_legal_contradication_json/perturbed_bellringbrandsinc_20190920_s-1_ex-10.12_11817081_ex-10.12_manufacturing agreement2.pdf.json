                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall endeavor to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, possibly contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage’s [***] facility and Premier’s potential approval of that facility by January 1, 2019.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be required' with 'shall endeavor' weakens the obligation to purchase the MAOV, making it non-mandatory. Also, replacing contingent with possibly contingent makes the obligations vague for Heritage. This introduces an ambiguous legal obligation as the level of effort required by 'endeavor' and the certainty of the contingency is unclear. The word 'potential' adds uncertainty to whether the obligations are set in stone, or if they are subject to change based on Premier's approval.",

                "changed_text": "For the potential avoidance of doubt, for the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will aim to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period may be considered a “Contract Period”).",
                "explanation": "By adding 'potential avoidance of doubt' and changing 'will be required' to 'will aim to purchase,' the obligation on Premier is significantly weakened. Furthermore, changing 'are each' to 'may be considered' makes the definition of 'Contract Period' ambiguous, creating uncertainty about which periods are subject to specific contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'potentially' and changing 'shall remain' to 'might remain in general' casts doubt on whether the original agreement's terms are still valid. The addition of 'general' dilutes the impact of the original agreement's enforcement. This creates ambiguity regarding which aspects of the original agreement are still legally binding.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Integrity will obtain master lease and print agreements with all third party owners of masters embodied in the Product at its own expense. Mechanical rates will not exceed [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the then-current statutory rate, and Print licenses will not exceed a prorated portion of [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the retail selling price, Integrity will also manufacture the Product and sell to TL its requirements for resale.",
                "changed_text": "Integrity will endeavor to obtain master lease and print agreements with third-party owners of masters embodied in the Product. Mechanical rates should generally align with the then-current statutory rate, and Print licenses should be somewhat proportional to the retail selling price. Integrity will manufacture the Product and aims to fulfill TL's requirements for resale.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for Integrity to obtain licenses within defined rate limits. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'endeavor,' 'generally align,' 'somewhat proportional' and 'aims to fulfill,' making the licensing and fulfillment obligations less stringent and enforceable. This could lead to disputes over whether Integrity has adequately fulfilled its responsibilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Act, potentially violating the compulsory licensing provisions if Integrity fails to secure necessary licenses due to the weakened obligation.",

                "changed_text": "All such artwork will be subject to Integrity's approval, which should generally be provided in a timely manner. (Integrity will attempt to respond to any request for approval reasonably soon after Integrity's receipt of request and samples.)",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear timeframe (five business days) for Integrity to respond to artwork approval requests. The modified text replaces this with vague terms like 'generally be provided in a timely manner' and 'attempt to respond reasonably soon,' introducing ambiguity and making it difficult to enforce a specific response time. This also removes the mutual agreement to provide a response within five business days, adding more ambiguity on how long the artwork will be held up.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - The ambiguity removes the clear obligation for a timely response, hindering Time Life's ability to meet deadlines and potentially causing financial harm.",

                "changed_text": "The parties may consider sharing mailing list data of purchasers of the products created hereunder, possibly in exchange for names of somewhat comparable value.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear and mandatory agreement to share mailing list data on an equal-value basis. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'may consider' and 'possibly,' making the sharing of data discretionary rather than mandatory and also changes the value proposition of sharing data.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of consumer privacy laws (depending on how data is acquired and shared) and also breach of contract (failure to uphold the data-sharing agreement).",

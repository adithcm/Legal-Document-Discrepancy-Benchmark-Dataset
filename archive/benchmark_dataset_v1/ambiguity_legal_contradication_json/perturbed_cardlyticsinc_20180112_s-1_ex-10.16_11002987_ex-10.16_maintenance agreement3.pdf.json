                "changed_text": "Supplier Name:\n\nCardlytics, Inc.\n Agreement Number:\n CW251207\nSupplier Address:\n\nBest efforts will be used to maintain accurate contact information, including:\n621 North Avenue NE\nSuite C-30\nAtlanta, GA 30308",
                "explanation": "Replacing the definite address with 'Best efforts will be used to maintain accurate contact information' introduces ambiguity. This makes it difficult to serve legal notices or enforce contractual obligations dependent on the supplier's physical location. While the address is included, the 'best efforts' clause weakens the commitment to maintaining that specific address. The contract is based in Georgia, and under Georgia law, proper notification is vital for contract enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall have the meaning' to 'shall generally have the meaning' introduces ambiguity regarding the definitions of capitalized terms. This allows for potential disputes over interpretation and undermines the clear, consistent definitions intended by referencing the SLCMA. This could impede clear contract enforcement under Georgia law, which stresses the significance of clear contractual language.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'in order to set forth the terms and conditions' to 'with the intent to allow' weakens the binding nature of the original agreement. Also, 'desire to add' has been changed to 'may desire to add', which introduces ambiguity, making it uncertain whether the Offer Placement System Software will actually be included. This weakens the obligation for the supplier to provide it and can lead to issues with fulfillment and Georgia contract laws.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Party A shall charge Party B energy saving service fee according to the income from CDQ waste heat power generation station.",
                "changed_text": "Party A may charge Party B an energy saving service fee based on a loose interpretation of income from the CDQ waste heat power generation station.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' makes the fee discretionary. Including 'loose interpretation' introduces vagueness regarding how the income is calculated. The phrase 'based on' gives it uncertainty, failing to set a clear standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 8: A contract legally formed is binding on the parties. The parties shall perform their obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.",

                "original_text": "From the starting day of the project, Party B must ensure that the coking system works properly and working hours of the CDQ system must be no less than 8,000 hours/year. Party A must ensure the waste heat power generation system of CDQ working hours no less than 7,200 hours/year.",
                "changed_text": "From the commencement of operations, Party B should endeavor to keep the coking system functioning, with operating hours of the CDQ system ideally approaching 8,000 hours annually. Party A should also attempt to maintain the waste heat power generation system from the CDQ at around 7,200 hours per year.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'must ensure' to 'should endeavor' and 'should also attempt' weakens the commitment to specific operational hours, which were mandatory. Replacing 'no less than' with 'ideally approaching' and 'around' further makes the yearly operating hours target vague and non-binding.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 60: The parties shall fully perform their obligations according to the contract. They shall perform the obligation of notification, assistance and confidentiality according to the nature and purpose of the contract and transaction practices.",

                "changed_text": "The CDQ and CDQ power generation systems should generally align with national environmental protection standards. If environmental concerns arise during operation, Party A may be held liable, depending on circumstances.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'should generally align' diminishes the requirement for strict compliance with environmental standards. The phrase 'environmental concerns arise' is vague, and replacing 'shall bear the liability' with 'may be held liable, depending on circumstances' introduces uncertainty regarding liability for environmental pollution.",
                "contradicted_law": "Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 41: Entities causing environmental pollution are responsible for prevention and control measures.",

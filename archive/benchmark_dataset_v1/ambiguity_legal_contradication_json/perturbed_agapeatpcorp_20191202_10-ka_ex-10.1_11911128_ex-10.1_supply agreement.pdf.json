                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Manufacturer covenants that it is and will remain for the term of this agreement in compliance with any and all Local Laws and Regulations. This includes without limitation laws relating to business practice, workplace relations, safety and taxation.",
                "changed_text": "The Manufacturer shall endeavor to comply with applicable Local Laws and Regulations. This may include laws relating to business practice, workplace relations, safety, and taxation.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'is and will remain in compliance' with 'shall endeavor to comply,' making compliance subject to interpretation. The use of 'may include' further diminishes the obligation by suggesting that adherence to the listed laws is not strictly required. This creates ambiguity around which specific laws must be followed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Vanuatu law requires mandatory compliance with all local laws and regulations, not simply an endeavor to comply. The Employment Act, Workplace Safety and Health Act, and Taxation Act all mandate specific compliance, not optional efforts.",

                "changed_text": "The Manufacturing Companies utilized by the Agent to manufacture the products listed in Schedule A of this agreement should attempt to maintain product liability insurance as they deem necessary. The extent of coverage is subject to their discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to maintain adequate product liability insurance. Changing 'shall maintain' to 'should attempt to maintain' makes insurance coverage optional, and adding that 'the extent of coverage is subject to their discretion' introduces ambiguity regarding the level of protection required. This could lead to insufficient coverage, potentially violating consumer protection laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Depending on the jurisdiction where the products are sold (Global - All countries), consumer protection laws mandate adequate product liability insurance to protect consumers from harm caused by defective products. Making the insurance coverage discretionary could violate these laws if the coverage is insufficient.",

                "changed_text": "The Customer will possibly compensate the Manufacturer a nominal amount per book prior to printing, the exact figure to be determined later.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will compensate...AUS $1.00' to 'will possibly compensate a nominal amount,' the legal obligation for a specific payment is removed. The addition of 'the exact figure to be determined later' makes the payment obligation uncertain and unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles require clear and definite terms, especially regarding payment obligations. An agreement to pay a 'nominal amount' to be determined later is too vague to be enforceable, potentially violating contract law requirements in multiple jurisdictions (England - Governing Law).",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Franchisee shall ensure that the Smaaash Centres shall be set up, established, operated, managed, advertised, marketed, promoted, publicized and otherwise exploited, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations in the Territory, including without limitation, all customs requirements and country of origin regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall endeavor to ensure that the Smaaash Centres are generally set up, established, operated, managed, advertised, marketed, promoted, publicized and otherwise exploited, in a manner that is purportedly compliant with applicable laws and regulations in the Territory, including, without limitation, all customs requirements and country of origin regulations.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall ensure' with 'shall endeavor to ensure', weakening the obligation to a 'best effort' standard. It also introduces 'purportedly compliant', suggesting that compliance is not guaranteed. This contradicts the strict compliance required by various state and federal regulations regarding business operations, advertising, and consumer protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and state laws including consumer protection laws and advertising standards which require strict compliance, not just 'purported' compliance.",

                "original_text": "Franchisee shall exercise its best efforts to effectively market, promote, and publicise the Smaaash Centres throughout the Territory. Franchisee shall also be obligated to identify suitable locations to set up the Smaaash Centres. Franchisee shall comply with, and ensure that the third party sub-franchisees comply with the standards prescribed by Franchisor (as provided in the operating manuals which shall be shared by Franchisor with Franchisee) with respect to the services, products and operations of the Smaaash Centres and shall operate the Smaaash Centres in strict conformity with such standards and specifications as Franchisor may from time to time prescribe to Franchisee. Franchisee shall refrain from deviating from such standards and specifications without Franchisor’s prior written consent and from otherwise operating in any manner which reflects adversely on the Trademarks and Smaaash Centres.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee should consider exercising reasonable efforts to market, promote, and publicize the Smaaash Centres throughout the Territory. Franchisee may also attempt to identify potentially suitable locations to set up the Smaaash Centres. Franchisee should generally attempt to comply with the standards prescribed by Franchisor (as provided in the operating manuals which shall be shared by Franchisor with Franchisee) with respect to the services, products and operations of the Smaaash Centres and should operate the Smaaash Centres in general alignment with such standards and specifications as Franchisor may from time to time prescribe to Franchisee. Franchisee may deviate from such standards and specifications absent Franchisor’s explicit disapproval and may operate in a manner that does not blatantly undermine the Trademarks and Smaaash Centres.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the obligations of the Franchisee. 'Shall exercise its best efforts' becomes 'should consider exercising reasonable efforts,' making the marketing efforts less stringent. 'Shall comply with' is changed to 'should generally attempt to comply with,' introducing ambiguity. Additionally, the standard for deviation is relaxed from 'Franchisor’s prior written consent' to 'absent Franchisor’s explicit disapproval', shifting the burden of enforcement. This potentially contradicts advertising standards and brand protection laws that require strict adherence to brand guidelines and prohibit deceptive marketing practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Advertising standards and brand protection laws, including the Lanham Act in the United States, which require consistent and non-deceptive marketing practices.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, Franchisee will endeavor to procure insurance policies it deems adequate, as the Franchisee understands to be subject to applicable law, in broad relation to the Smaaash Centres.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'shall maintain policies of insurance as may be requested by Franchisor' is replaced with 'will endeavor to procure insurance policies it deems adequate'. This makes the insurance coverage subjective, depending on the Franchisee's assessment of adequacy rather than the Franchisor's requirements. The addition of 'as the Franchisee understands to be subject to applicable law' further muddies the waters, suggesting a potentially incomplete or misinformed understanding of legal requirements. This may not satisfy standard business practice requirements or landlord/lessor insurance requirements for business operations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard business insurance requirements and landlord/lessor requirements for sufficient insurance coverage, potentially violating contractual obligations with landlords and other third parties.",

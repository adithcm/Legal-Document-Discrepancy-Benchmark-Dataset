            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*], subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor may be considered as a distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*], conditional on Distributor making some effort to conduct marketing activities.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be' to 'may be considered' introduces ambiguity about the exclusivity of the distribution agreement. Replacing 'subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing activities' with 'conditional on Distributor making some effort to conduct marketing activities' weakens the obligation to conduct specific, agreed-upon marketing activities. This creates uncertainty about the distributor's responsibilities and NETGEAR's commitment to exclusivity. It is difficult to enforce a marketing effort without specific metrics and guidelines to follow. \"Some effort\" is vague, and the distributor can claim any activity as fulfilling this requirement.",

                "changed_text": "Following the [*], for any extension or renewal term, Distributor's appointment as Distributor will be reviewed periodically, and NETGEAR might consider appointing other distributors in [*].",
                "explanation": "The alteration from 'shall be non-exclusive' to 'will be reviewed periodically' introduces ambiguity regarding the distributor's status after the initial term. Also, changing 'NETGEAR may appoint' to 'NETGEAR might consider appointing' makes the appointment of other distributors uncertain, reducing the definitiveness of NETGEAR's right to appoint other distributors. This weakens NETGEAR's position.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",

                "changed_text": "The terms and conditions of this Amendment, should possibly amend conflicting terms of the original Agreement. All other terms of the original Agreement may remain unchanged.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall amend and supersede' to 'should possibly amend' introduces uncertainty as to whether the amendment will actually override conflicting terms in the original agreement. Replacing 'shall remain unchanged' with 'may remain unchanged' further weakens the contract, making the enforceability and interpretation of the original agreement's terms unclear. This creates an ambiguous legal obligation because it doesn't clearly define which terms are in effect.",

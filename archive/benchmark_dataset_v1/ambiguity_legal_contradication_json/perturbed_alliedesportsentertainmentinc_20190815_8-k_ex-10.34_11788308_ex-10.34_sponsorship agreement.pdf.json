                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Allied shall comply with:\n(a) all applicable laws, rules, regulations, regulatory policies, guidelines or codes applicable to the Arena and Allied’s\nactivities to be carried out in performing its obligations in accordance with this Agreement, including all such guidelines and codes issued\nby statutory, regulatory and industry bodies, and further, will not pay, deliver, or offer or promise to pay or deliver, any funds or other item\nof value excluding the Products, either directly or through any third party, to any state or federal governmental official for any reason\nwhatsoever other than the payment of statutory and administrative fees, charges and taxes that are due from Allied as a result of its\nperformance under this Agreement;",
                "changed_text": "Allied shall generally strive to comply with:\n(a) what it reasonably believes to be the applicable laws, rules, regulations, regulatory policies, guidelines or codes applicable to the Arena and Allied’s activities. Allied will refrain from paying, delivering, or offering funds to any state or federal governmental official for reasons other than statutory and administrative fees it understands to be due.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall comply' with 'shall generally strive to comply,' weakening the obligation to adhere strictly to all applicable laws. Additionally, using 'what it reasonably believes' introduces a subjective element, making it harder to enforce compliance. The removal of 'either directly or through any third party' potentially opens a loophole for indirect payments. The last change of 'charges and taxes that are due from Allied as a result of its performance under this Agreement' to 'fees it understands to be due' creates an ambiguity regarding what constitutes a due fee.",

                "changed_text": "In Allied's actions and publications regarding the Events, Allied will aim to communicate Newegg's sponsorship, as it deems fit.",
                "explanation": "This weakens Allied's obligation by removing 'where possible and appropriate, Allied shall where reasonably practicable communicate that Newegg is the exclusive sponsor'. Replacing it with 'Allied will aim to communicate Newegg's sponsorship, as it deems fit' makes the communication discretionary, potentially undermining Newegg's sponsorship benefits. \"As it deems fit\" introduces a highly subjective standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract/failure to provide agreed-upon consideration. The original clause provides a clear obligation of Allied to communicate Newegg's exclusive sponsorship. The change undermines the core benefit that Newegg bargained for, which could be construed as a breach of contract under California law.",

                "original_text": "Allied shall use its best endeavours to deliver or ensure the delivery to Newegg of each and all of the Sponsorship Rights. Without\nlimitation of the preceding sentence or any other provision of this Agreement, Allied\nshall identify and name Newegg as a Founding Partner, and as the exclusive Technology E-Commerce (or E-tail) Partner, of the Arena and in all of\nAllied’s marketing materials in connection with the Arena where reasonably practicable.",
                "changed_text": "Allied will use reasonable efforts to provide Newegg the Sponsorship Rights. Allied will try to mention Newegg as a partner in some marketing materials where it makes sense.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'best endeavours' to 'reasonable efforts' lowers the standard of effort required. Replacing 'shall identify and name Newegg as a Founding Partner, and as the exclusive Technology E-Commerce (or E-tail) Partner, of the Arena and in all of Allied’s marketing materials in connection with the Arena where reasonably practicable' with 'will try to mention Newegg as a partner in some marketing materials where it makes sense' makes Newegg's recognition vague and dependent on Allied's subjective assessment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract/failure to provide agreed-upon consideration. The original clause creates a concrete obligation to identify Newegg as a partner in marketing materials. The new language makes this obligation discretionary, potentially depriving Newegg of a significant agreed-upon benefit, leading to a breach of contract claim under California law.",

Vendor shall procure all approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits that such Laws require for the performance of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Vendor shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all Laws applicable to Vendor’s performance under this Agreement, including all Work contemplated herein and all Material, Services and Deliverables provided hereunder, and AT&T’s utilization of the Cell Sites. Vendor shall endeavor to procure approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits that such Laws require for the performance of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear legal obligation on the vendor to comply with all laws and procure all necessary permits. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall make reasonable efforts to comply' and 'shall procure' with 'shall endeavor to procure.' This weakens the obligation, potentially conflicting with laws that require strict compliance and creating uncertainty about what constitutes 'reasonable efforts' or 'endeavor'.",
                "contradicted_law": "OSHA regulations and various state and federal environmental regulations often require strict compliance, and the ambiguous language could lead to non-compliance.",

                "original_text": "Vendor shall at all times, and at its expense, keep AT&T and its landlord’s premises safe and free from accumulation of waste materials or rubbish caused by Vendor’s operations. Upon completion of the Work, Vendor shall, at its expense, remove promptly from the premises all of Vendor’s implements, equipment, tools, machines, surplus and waste materials and debris. If Vendor fails to clean up as provided herein, AT&T may hire another contractor to do so and charge the cost thereof to Vendor or deduct same from AT&T’s payments to Vendor.",
                "changed_text": "Vendor shall endeavor to keep AT&T and its landlord’s premises reasonably safe and free from significant accumulation of waste materials or rubbish caused by Vendor’s operations. Upon completion of the Work, Vendor shall make reasonable efforts to remove from the premises Vendor’s implements, equipment, tools, machines, surplus and waste materials and debris. If Vendor does not reasonably clean up, AT&T may hire another contractor to do so and potentially charge the cost thereof to Vendor or deduct same from AT&T’s payments to Vendor.",
                "explanation": "The original text has clear directives, but the modified text uses vague terms like 'endeavor to keep reasonably safe,' 'significant accumulation,' 'make reasonable efforts to remove,' and 'does not reasonably clean up.' This introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of the vendor's responsibility and what constitutes a failure to clean up. This change transforms what was once a definitive and enforceable clause into a vague and potentially unenforceable provision.",
                "contradicted_law": "Local and federal environmental regulations that dictate specific standards for waste management and site safety, making the 'reasonable' standard insufficient.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that AT&T's representative can request Vendor to perform work in an emergency. The modified text weakens this directive by using phrases like 'believed to be', 'potentially request', and 'perhaps perform some Work'. This creates uncertainty about the circumstances under which the Vendor is obligated to act and the scope of work they might be expected to undertake, transforming the explicit and enforceable clause into an ambiguous suggestion with no concrete obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Duty of care. An emergency implies a need for immediate action, and this ambiguity could lead to delayed response times that violate that duty.",

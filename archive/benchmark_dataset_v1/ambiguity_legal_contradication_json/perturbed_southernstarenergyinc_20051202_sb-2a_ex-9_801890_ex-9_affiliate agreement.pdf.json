                "original_text": "(2) When using the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall observe the following obligations and precautions: (i) Only the Affiliate may use the user ID and password. (ii) The password shall be kept strictly confidential. The Affiliate shall take due care to ensure that no unauthorized parties learn the password. (iii) If the Affiliate loses its password or if there is a possibility that an unauthorized party has learned the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall immediately report this to element 5, which can then block access by the Affiliate to the Control Panel. All actions carried out with the user ID and password will be attributed to the Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "(2) When using the user ID and password, the Affiliate should endeavor to observe the following obligations and precautions: (i) The Affiliate should generally be the primary user of the user ID and password. (ii) The password should be kept reasonably confidential. The Affiliate should use efforts to prevent unauthorized parties from easily discovering the password. (iii) If the Affiliate suspects a password compromise, the Affiliate may, at its discretion, report this to element 5. Actions carried out with the user ID and password may potentially be attributed to the Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. 'Should endeavor' weakens the obligation. 'Generally be the primary user' allows for shared access. 'Reasonably confidential' and 'use efforts' are vague standards of security. Making reporting of potential compromise discretionary weakens security. The attribution of actions is also made less definite. This weakens the security requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "GDPR (if personal data of EU residents is processed) and other data protection laws like CCPA, which require specific and demonstrable security measures.",

                "original_text": "The Affiliate shall guarantee the above named properties of its Web sites and will pay defense costs and indemnify and keep fully indemnified the Software Publisher and element 5, its subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents upon demand from any and all claims, demands, costs, liabilities, losses, expenses, and damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expert witnesses' fees) arising out of or in connection with any breach by Affiliate of its warranty set out in this clause.",
                "changed_text": "The Affiliate will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the above named properties of its Web sites and will contribute to defense costs and reasonably indemnify the Software Publisher and element 5, its subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents for some claims, demands, costs, liabilities, losses, expenses, and damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expert witnesses' fees) arising out of or in connection with a demonstrable breach by Affiliate of its warranty set out in this clause.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall guarantee' to 'will use commercially reasonable efforts', the obligation to ensure specific properties is weakened. 'Contribute to defense costs' reduces the responsibility to full payment, and 'reasonably indemnify' introduces subjectivity. Limiting to 'some claims' and requiring a 'demonstrable breach' further diminishes the affiliate's liability, creating loopholes that can be exploited.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies depending on the specific warranties being made, but could contradict laws related to false advertising, copyright infringement, or defamation if the affiliate's website violates those laws. The ambiguity weakens the indemnification clause, making it less effective in protecting against legal claims arising from these violations.",

                "changed_text": "element 5 may modify and supplement these General Terms and Conditions from time to time. element 5 will endeavor to maintain a current version for viewing on its website. Moreover, element 5 will attempt to announce any significant changes to these terms via e-mail. Affiliate and Software Publisher may optionally object to such changes within 14 days of the announcement of changed participation terms. Continued participation implies acceptance of the changes.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the process for modifying the contract. Replacing 'reserves the right' with 'may modify' implies less certainty. Replacing 'will be maintained' with 'will endeavor to maintain' makes providing access to the current version of the terms optional. Changing 'will announce' to 'will attempt to announce' makes notification of changes uncertain. Removing the automatic acceptance after 14 days and replacing it with 'Continued participation implies acceptance' is problematic because 'continued participation' is vaguely defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring clear agreement to modifications. The vagueness of 'continued participation' makes it difficult to prove that the affiliate knowingly agreed to the changed terms, potentially rendering the modifications unenforceable.",

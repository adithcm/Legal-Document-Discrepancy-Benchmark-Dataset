                "changed_text": "EHS and EHN will generally bear costs associated with product development, inventory, sales, and marketing of Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that EHS and EHN 'shall bear all costs'. The modified version replaces 'shall bear all costs' with 'will generally bear costs', making the obligation ambiguous. This creates an avenue where EHS/EHN might argue that certain costs fall outside their responsibility based on subjective interpretation. The use of 'generally' weakens the commitment and creates an unenforceable obligation.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly prohibits Dr. Murray from assisting in the development of competitive products. The modified version uses 'shall endeavor not to' and 'may be seen as competitive', which weakens the obligation and introduces subjectivity. 'Endeavor' implies an effort but not a guarantee, and 'may be seen as competitive' leaves room for interpretation, making it difficult to prove a breach of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law. The weakened language makes the non-compete clause difficult to enforce, undermining its intended purpose. Clear and unambiguous terms are essential for enforceability of such clauses.",

EHS or EHN agrees to reimburse Dr. Murray for all reasonable expenses (air travel, hotel, car rental, meals, materials, etc.) relating to EHS or EHN directed activities, subject to prior approval in each case.",
                "changed_text": "EHS or EHN will consider reimbursing pre-approved expenses incurred by Dr. Murray during any Services Term. Reimbursement for reasonable expenses may be provided if deemed appropriate by EHS or EHN leadership, subject to approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that 'pre-approved expenses will be reimbursed' and 'EHS or EHN agrees to reimburse...reasonable expenses'. The modified version uses 'will consider reimbursing' and 'may be provided if deemed appropriate', which makes the reimbursement discretionary rather than mandatory. This introduces ambiguity and gives EHS/EHN the power to deny reimbursement even for pre-approved or reasonable expenses. This undermines the clarity of the financial obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - specifically related to fulfilling financial obligations. The ambiguity allows EHS or EHN to avoid what was previously a more defined responsibility for expense reimbursement. Principles of contract law require clear financial terms.",

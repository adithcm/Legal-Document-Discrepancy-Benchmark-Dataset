                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "CONSULTANT shall consult with REIT and provide the services outlined in the attached Statement of Work in a timely and professional manner in accordance with industry standards.",
                "changed_text": "CONSULTANT shall consult with REIT and provide services outlined in the attached Statement of Work as they see fit.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'in a timely and professional manner in accordance with industry standards' with 'as they see fit,' the obligation to adhere to any specific industry standards or timelines is removed. This introduces ambiguity and allows the consultant to potentially provide substandard or delayed services without a clear breach of contract, as the interpretation of 'as they see fit' is highly subjective.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principle of 'good faith and fair dealing,' which implies a reasonable standard of performance. This is further exacerbated if the 'services outlined' require professional licensing or certifications in Virginia, implying a standard of care is expected.",

                "changed_text": "Completeness of work product may be discussed with REIT, and CONSULTANT will consider making revisions, additions, deletions, or alterations as deemed appropriate by CONSULTANT.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides REIT with the sole discretion to determine the completeness of the work product and requires the CONSULTANT to make requested changes. The modified text weakens this obligation by suggesting only a discussion, and making revisions subject to the CONSULTANT's discretion. This introduces ambiguity, as it is unclear whether the consultant is actually obligated to make any changes requested by REIT, regardless of the quality or utility of the changes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of cooperation in contract law. By allowing the consultant to arbitrarily refuse revisions, this obstructs the REIT's ability to receive the full benefit of the agreement.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "CONSULTANT agrees to act in good faith so as to not harm the business reputation of the Company in any way. CONSULTANT further agrees that it will not directly or indirectly defame, disparage, or publicly criticize the services, business, integrity, veracity or reputation of the Company or its owners, officers, directors, or employees in any forum or through any medium of communication.",
                "changed_text": "CONSULTANT will endeavor to act in good faith so as to avoid harming the business reputation of the Company. CONSULTANT will aim to refrain from defaming, disparaging, or publicly criticizing the services, business, integrity, veracity, or reputation of the Company or its owners, officers, directors, or employees in any forum or through any medium of communication to the best of their ability.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees to act' to 'will endeavor to act' and 'will not...defame' to 'will aim to refrain... to the best of their ability', the original text's strong prohibition against harming the company's reputation and disparaging comments is weakened significantly. 'Endeavor' and 'aim to refrain' introduce ambiguity, implying that CONSULTANT is not absolutely obligated to avoid disparagement. 'To the best of their ability' makes the obligation highly subjective and difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "Defamation law. While the original clause aimed to prevent defamation (which is illegal), the modified clause makes it much harder for the company to prove a breach, even if defamatory statements are made. The 'best of their ability' clause allows for potential defenses based on subjective interpretations.",

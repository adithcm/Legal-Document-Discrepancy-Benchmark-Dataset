                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "PrimeCall and DeltaThree each agree that for the longest period permitted by law each shall hold in strictest confidence and, without the prior written approval of the other party hereto, not to use for their own benefit or the benefit of any party other than the other party hereto, or disclose to any person, firm or corporation other than such party (other than as required by law) any confidential proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the other party hereto",
                "changed_text": "PrimeCall and DeltaThree each agree that they shall endeavor to hold in confidence what they perceive to be confidential proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the other party hereto",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces the strict obligation to hold information in 'strictest confidence' with a weaker, subjective standard of endeavoring to hold what they 'perceive to be' confidential information. This introduces significant ambiguity as to what constitutes a breach of confidentiality, as it relies on each party's subjective perception rather than an objective standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law regarding trade secrets and confidential information requires a reasonable degree of diligence and objective standards to protect such information. This weakens that protection.",

The PrimeCall Web Site shall be a fully functional e-commerce site, with all ordering and billing performed on-line.",
                "changed_text": "DeltaThree shall attempt to establish a PrimeCall web site (the \"PrimeCall Web Site\") following discussions with PrimeCall. The goal is to enable PrimeCall to market its calling cards via the World Wide Web, perhaps providing some on-line support. The PrimeCall Web Site should aim to be an e-commerce site, and hopefully will allow ordering and billing performed on-line.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing definite obligations with vague intentions. 'Shall establish' becomes 'shall attempt to establish,' 'will enable' becomes 'the goal is to enable, perhaps providing some support,' and 'shall be' becomes 'should aim to be, and hopefully will allow'. This weakens DeltaThree's commitment to providing a functional e-commerce site.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract under New York law. The original clause represents a clear obligation to create a fully functional e-commerce website. The modified clause provides no guarantees which weakens contract enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "DeltaThree may consider conducting some e-mail promotions if PrimeCall requests it and if both parties vaguely agree on the target audience. The provision of services outlined in Section 4.03 will ideally be at no cost to PrimeCall.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'DeltaThree shall also conduct' is replaced with 'DeltaThree may consider conducting,' weakening the obligation. The definitive 'mutually agreed to' is replaced with the vague 'if both parties vaguely agree.' The 'shall be provided at no additional cost' is made uncertain with 'will ideally be at no cost.'",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract under New York law. The original clause represents a binding and enforceable promise by DeltaThree to run mutually agreed upon targeted e-mail campaigns at PrimeCall's request for no extra charge. The modified clause provides no promise and weakened enforcement.",

                "original_text": "To maintain all financial records of the Company and provide quarterly and annual reporting to all Company stakeholders. All records are kept under US GAAP compliance standards.",
                "changed_text": "To maintain financial records of the Company and provide periodic reporting to Company stakeholders as deemed necessary. Records may or may not adhere to US GAAP compliance standards.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'quarterly and annual reporting' with 'periodic reporting as deemed necessary', making the reporting frequency discretionary rather than mandatory. Furthermore, stating that records 'may or may not adhere' to US GAAP weakens the requirement for standardized accounting practices. This contradicts SEC regulations and generally accepted accounting principles, potentially leading to inaccurate financial reporting and non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "To make reasonable efforts to grow medicinal agriculture crop at a high standard, with biomass testing potentially conducted by an independent third party.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'to grow at the highest standard' with 'make reasonable efforts to grow at a high standard' introduces ambiguity and lowers the standard of care expected. Changing 'subject to independent third party biomass testing' to 'with biomass testing potentially conducted' makes the testing optional. This can be a violation because without proper testing the products being produced may be harmful.",

                "changed_text": "The Company will attempt to remit tax liabilities in a reasonable timeframe and generally consider tax implications. HGF will try to reduce taxes and, if feasible, eliminate them.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'ensure timely remittance' with 'attempt to remit in a reasonable timeframe' weakens the obligation. Substituting 'ensure specific adherence' with 'generally consider' makes tax compliance less stringent. Changing 'ensure maximum tax reduction' to 'try to reduce taxes' makes it less certain that HGF will actually take actions to reduce taxes. This conflicts with IRS regulations which require that taxes be paid on time.",

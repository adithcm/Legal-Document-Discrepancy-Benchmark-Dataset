                "original_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member’s fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be requested to consider making an extra payment. The Board of Directors will use its discretion to determine the amount of any extra payment, potentially based on each member's perceived fair share of the deficiency. You may consider making the extra payment by a potential reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you opt not to make the extra payment within a reasonable timeframe from the date we notify you, an amount might be charged as a potential indebtedness against the contract with interest potentially compounded at a somewhat standard rate per year.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the member 'may be required' to make an extra payment, and the amount is 'based on each member’s fair share'. The modified text softens this obligation by using 'may be requested to consider,' 'use its discretion to determine,' and 'potentially based on each member's perceived fair share,' making the obligation and calculation method ambiguous. The original text also sets a clear deadline of '60 days' while the modified text says 'reasonable timeframe'. Also, the use of 'somewhat standard rate' for interest and 'might be charged' softens the penalty for non-payment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 611, specifically sections concerning insurer solvency and policyholder rights, require clear and non-discretionary mechanisms for assessing and addressing solvency deficiencies. This ambiguous language undermines those requirements.",

Benefits might be reduced or eliminated by any future amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states what the Entire Contract consists of, limiting it to specific documents and prohibiting future amendments from reducing benefits. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'generally consists of,' 'most attached riders... that are deemed relevant,' 'potentially subject to certain undisclosed conditions,' 'except for any changes that management reasonably believes should apply', and 'Benefits might be reduced or eliminated'. This makes the scope of the contract unclear and allows the insurer to alter the terms unilaterally, thus reducing the customer's assurance of the terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Wisconsin Statutes 632.41(1)(a) requires that insurance policies clearly state the entire contract between the parties. The ambiguous language inserted undermines this requirement, potentially conflicting with contract law principles related to offer, acceptance, and consideration, which require a clear and definite agreement.",

Society membership rights and privileges generally cannot be transferred or assigned unless specific exceptions apply.",
                "explanation": "The original text says, 'You may transfer ownership of this contract in accordance with our bylaws.' The modified text introduces ambiguity and uncertainty by saying 'You may attempt to transfer ownership of this contract, potentially in accordance with our bylaws.' This makes the ability to transfer ownership of the contract questionable. The inclusion of 'unless specific exceptions apply' adds additional ambiguity because the exceptions aren't stated.",
                "contradicted_law": "Wisconsin Statutes 632.72 states policy assignability rights. The added ambiguity around if the ownership of the contract can be transferred is in violation of these rights.",

Upon the termination of this Agreement, Party B shall return to Party A or destroy any document, material or software containing such business secrets and delete the same from any memory devices.",

Upon the termination of this Agreement, Party B shall make reasonable efforts to return to Party A or destroy any document, material or software containing such business secrets and attempt to delete the same from any memory devices.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall keep' to 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation to maintain confidentiality. Replacing 'shall return or destroy' with 'make reasonable efforts to return or destroy' makes the action discretionary. Also, replacing 'delete' with 'attempt to delete' further reduces the certainty of compliance. According to PRC Law, Article 9 of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law states that business secrets should be strictly kept, and taking feeble actions will be considered as a failure to fulfill the confidential obligations.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of any legal action taken by Party A to protect any Intellectual Property Right of the Program Content, or any dispute with any third party in connection with any Intellectual Property Right of the Program Content in which Party A is involved, Party B will consider providing assistance to the extent that it deems feasible, with costs to be determined later. If Party B’s actions lead to the legal action, Party B will consider covering costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Party B 'shall provide… all assistance reasonably requested by Party A', which indicates a clear obligation. The perturbed text changes it to 'Party B will consider providing assistance to the extent that it deems feasible', introducing subjectivity and weakening the obligation. Furthermore, the cost allocation is made ambiguous. This could run afoul of intellectual property laws in China, where cooperation is generally required when IP rights are infringed.",

                "original_text": "Any dispute, conflict or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the performance hereof shall be resolved by the Parties through amicable negotiation, which negotiation shall commence immediately upon notice by one Party to the other of the nature of such dispute, conflict or claim. In the event that such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) Business Days following such notice, either Party may upon the expiration of the such 30-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect. The arbitration shall be conducted in Hong Kong in English and the arbitral award shall be binding upon both Parties. During the resolution (including the arbitration) of the dispute, the Parties shall continue to perform other portions of this Agreement unaffected by such dispute.",
                "changed_text": "Any dispute, conflict or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the performance hereof may be resolved by the Parties through negotiation, which should commence within a reasonable timeframe. If the dispute is not resolved, the Parties may consider arbitration. The decision to arbitrate and its rules are subject to mutual agreement at that time. During the resolution, the Parties should strive to continue to perform other unaffected parts of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates negotiation and then provides a clear path to arbitration. The modified text makes negotiation optional ('may be resolved'), delays the start of negotiation ('should commence within a reasonable timeframe' is vague), makes arbitration discretionary ('may consider arbitration'), and removes the commitment to Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre. This weakens dispute resolution, potentially violating PRC Contract Law which expects clear dispute resolution mechanisms.",

                "changed_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable will endeavor not to edit or modify the above content.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to not' to 'will endeavor not to' weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' implies an attempt but not a guarantee, making it less enforceable. This introduces ambiguity as to whether any modification would be a breach of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding clear and unambiguous obligations. In Nevada, as in most states, contracts are interpreted based on their plain meaning, and ambiguous terms are construed against the drafter. This change introduces ambiguity.",

                "changed_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable will attempt to include a disclaimer on the Watchit Content, which may generally state that the materials shown are for entertainment purposes only.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the specific disclaimer text with a vague statement of intent significantly weakens the protection against liability. The original text provided a clear and specific disclaimer, while the modified text introduces uncertainty regarding the content and enforcement of the disclaimer, potentially violating consumer protection laws if misleading content is shown.",
                "contradicted_law": "Nevada Deceptive Trade Practices Act (NRS 598.090 et seq.) which prohibits false or misleading advertising. The ambiguous disclaimer may not adequately protect against claims of deceptive practices if the content is perceived as misleading.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'agree to discuss' to 'will use reasonable efforts to discuss' weakens the obligation to have a discussion before using information for promotion. 'Reasonable efforts' is vague and does not guarantee a discussion will occur, making it difficult to enforce. This could be problematic if one party misrepresents the arrangement.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding good faith and fair dealing. While Nevada law recognizes an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, the vague 'reasonable efforts' standard introduces ambiguity that could allow a party to circumvent the spirit of the agreement.",

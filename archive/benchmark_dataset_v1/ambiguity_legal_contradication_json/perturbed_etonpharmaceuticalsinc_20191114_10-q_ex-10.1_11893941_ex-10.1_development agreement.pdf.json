                "changed_text": "ETON may provide support on regulatory activities, if convenient and potentially helpful for approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'commercially reasonable support'. The modified text replaces this with 'may provide support, if convenient and potentially helpful', weakening ETON's obligation. 'Convenient' and 'potentially helpful' are subjective and do not establish a clear, enforceable standard. This contradicts FDA regulations which require specific and consistent support for regulatory activities during drug approval process.",

                "explanation": "The modified text uses terms like 'endeavor to take actions,' 'as deemed necessary,' and 'potentially including payment,' making Aucta's responsibilities vague and discretionary. This contradicts the explicit requirements of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and other regulations, which mandate specific fees and reporting for maintaining drug approvals. It weakens the obligation to comply with laws and regulations.",

                "changed_text": "ETON will consider marketing the Products in the Territory during the Term of this Agreement as resources allow.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'commercially reasonable efforts' to 'will consider marketing... as resources allow' significantly weakens ETON's obligation. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' is a legal standard that can be objectively assessed. 'Will consider... as resources allow' makes ETON's marketing efforts entirely discretionary and dependent on internal resource allocation, which could be manipulated to avoid significant marketing activity. This creates an ambiguous level of obligation.",

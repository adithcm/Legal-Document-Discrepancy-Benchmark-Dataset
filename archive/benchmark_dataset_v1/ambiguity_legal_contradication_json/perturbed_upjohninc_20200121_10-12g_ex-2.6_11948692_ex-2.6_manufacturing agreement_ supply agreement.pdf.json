                "original_text": "Manufacturer shall devote adequate manufacturing capacity to be capable of manufacturing and supplying Product to Customer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Facility Addenda. Manufacturer shall promptly notify Customer if Manufacturer reasonably believes its existing capacity and demands thereon would prevent it from meeting Customer’s anticipated Product requirements as set forth in any Forecast that conforms to the requirements set forth in Section 2.4.",
                "changed_text": "Manufacturer will attempt to devote manufacturing capacity to be capable of manufacturing and supplying Product to Customer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Facility Addenda. Manufacturer may notify Customer if it believes its existing capacity and demands thereon could prevent it from meeting Customer’s anticipated Product requirements as set forth in any Forecast that conforms to the requirements set forth in Section 2.4.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'will attempt' and 'shall promptly notify' to 'may notify' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity, making it uncertain whether the manufacturer is truly committed to providing adequate capacity or informing the customer of potential shortfalls. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in all contracts governed by Delaware law, where the contract was signed, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in performing their contractual obligations. By weakening these commitments, Manufacturer could be seen as not acting in good faith if issues occur.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall include' to 'will endeavor to include' introduces ambiguity as it doesn't guarantee the inclusion of these critical certificates, which are vital for regulatory compliance and product safety. This creates uncertainty about the consistency and reliability of providing these documents, potentially conflicting with cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practices) regulations, which mandate that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. Certificates of compliance and analysis are often required to demonstrate adherence to these standards.",

Manufacturer may notify Customer of obvious errors or deficiencies in packaging materials.",
                "explanation": "Weakening 'shall assure' to 'will attempt to assure' and introducing 'reasonably consistent' creates uncertainty about whether packaging materials will precisely meet specifications. Replacing 'shall promptly notify' with 'may notify of obvious errors' diminishes the responsibility to report errors quickly. This contradicts FDA labeling requirements, which demand precise and accurate labeling to prevent misbranding and ensure patient safety. Vague language and the option to notify, rather than mandating it, introduces a possibility that non-compliant or incorrect labeling is used, risking the sale of misbranded drugs, as outlined under The Act.",

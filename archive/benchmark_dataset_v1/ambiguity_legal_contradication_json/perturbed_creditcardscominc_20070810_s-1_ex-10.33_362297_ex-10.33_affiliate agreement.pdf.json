                "explanation": "The original text places a strict responsibility on the affiliate to ensure proper link formatting for tracking. Modifying 'is solely responsible for ensuring' to 'will make reasonable efforts to ensure' weakens this obligation. Replacing 'which allows Chase to track such Approved Accounts' with 'that generally allows Chase to track Approved Accounts' introduces ambiguity about the required level of tracking precision. This could lead to disputes about whether the affiliate has met its obligations, especially if tracking is imperfect, and may violate the **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)**, which requires clear and accurate disclosures related to credit card offers, and the ambiguity around tracking could impede Chase's ability to appropriately apply and disclose those terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that all use of Chase marks is subject to prior written approval, which is a clear directive. The modified text changes this to 'may be subject to Chase's approval, when reasonably requested,' introducing ambiguity about when approval is actually needed and what constitutes a 'reasonable request.' This weakens Chase's control over its trademarks and introduces uncertainty, making enforcement more difficult. This may violate the **Lanham Act**, which protects trademark owners' rights to control the use of their marks and prevent consumer confusion, as inconsistent application of trademark usage rules can dilute the brand.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear and strong indemnification obligation for the affiliate. The modified text weakens this obligation by changing 'agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless' to 'shall endeavor to indemnify' and 'any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, damages or expenses' to 'claims, demands, losses or expenses'. Also removing \"(including attorneys’ fees and costs) of any nature whatsoever incurred or suffered by Chase (collectively the “losses”), in so far as such losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are related to, or are based on (i) the breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by Affiliate herein; or (ii) any claim related to Affiliate’s site.\" simplifies to \"in so far as such losses are potentially related to Affiliate's actions.' These changes introduce ambiguity about the extent and nature of the affiliate's indemnification responsibility, potentially conflicting with common law principles of contract interpretation where clear and unambiguous language is preferred. This could make it harder for Chase to recover losses if an issue arises from the affiliate's actions. Depending on the specific services performed by the affiliate, lack of clarity on responsibility for associated losses/expenses may violate laws related to liability depending on the specific damage, such as data breaches.",

Subject to Section 1.2, Franchisor hereby grants to Franchisee the exclusive right, (a) to\nestablish and operate Smaaash Centres in the Territory, (b) to sub-license the right to establish and operate Smaaash Centres to third party\nfranchisees in and for the Territory, (c) a license to use the products and other services developed by Franchisor with respect to the Smaaash\nCentres (including a right to authorise the use of products and services developed by the Franchisor by third party franchisees), in the Territory,\nand (d) to identify third party franchisees for the Smaaash Centres in the Territory. The rights granted herein include the limited license to use the\nTrademarks of the Franchisor (the details of which are morefully set out in Exhibit A), as set out in Section 3 of this Agreement, for the purposes of\nestablishing and operating the Smaaash Centres in the Territory. It is clarified that if third party franchisees shall be establishing and operating\nSmaaash Centres in the manner contemplated under this Agreement, then the Franchisee shall ensure that such third party franchisees complies\nwith all the obligations and duties of the Franchisee, as recorded under this Agreement, and to this extent, Franchisee may enter into relevant\nagreements with such third party franchisees.",

The modified version states the license \"shall not be exclusive\" and then defines exclusivity as allowing the Franchisor to grant more licenses, which directly contradicts the concept of exclusivity. This would create significant ambiguity regarding trademark usage and franchisee rights.",

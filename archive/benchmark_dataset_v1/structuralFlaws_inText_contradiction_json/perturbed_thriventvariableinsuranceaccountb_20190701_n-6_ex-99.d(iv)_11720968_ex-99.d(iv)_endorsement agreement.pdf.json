This contract's share may or may not be credited as a dividend, at the sole discretion of the Society, regardless of divisible surplus.

                "explanation": "The original text states dividends are based on divisible surplus, but then says dividends are not expected. The modified version completely undermines the link to divisible surplus by saying dividends are at the 'sole discretion of the Society' and based on 'factors not explicitly defined'. This introduces a contradiction, because while the contract says divisible surplus is considered, the payment of dividends is now arbitrary, making it uncertain when dividends will or will not be credited.",

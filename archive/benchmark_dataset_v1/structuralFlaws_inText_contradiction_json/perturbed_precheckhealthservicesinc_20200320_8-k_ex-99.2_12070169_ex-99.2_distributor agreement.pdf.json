                "explanation": "The original text states the territory can only be amended by mutual written agreement. The modified text gives the Principal the unilateral right to change the territory, directly contradicting the original requirement for mutual agreement.

The modification allows the Principal to terminate without notice, while requiring the Distributor to give 90 days' notice, creating an imbalance and contradiction in termination rights.",

Neither shall Dr. Murray have any rights or interest whatsoever in any intellectual property, trademarks, trade names, service marks, or other names or marks owned or used by EHS.",

Dr. Murray shall retain shared rights and interest whatsoever in any intellectual property, trademarks, trade names, service marks, or other names or marks owned or used by EHS.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that EHS and EHN have exclusive rights to intellectual property, but then stating that Dr. Murray retains shared rights in trademarks, trade names, and service marks owned or used by EHS. This creates uncertainty about the ownership of intellectual property.",

The Dr. Murray Products will be listed on Schedule A attached hereto as they are developed and added to product portfolio.

The Dr. Murray Products will be listed on Schedule A attached hereto as they are developed and added to product portfolio.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Originally, the text clearly stated Dr. Murray *will* receive royalties. The modified text makes the royalty payment conditional and discretionary by adding 'unless otherwise determined by EHN' and 'at EHN's sole discretion.' This creates uncertainty about whether Dr. Murray is guaranteed royalty payments, contradicting the initial statement.",

However, EHS retains the right to terminate this agreement at will, regardless of renewal status.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies that either party can prevent automatic renewal with proper notice. The addition of 'However, EHS retains the right to terminate this agreement at will, regardless of renewal status' contradicts the previous automatic renewal clause and creates uncertainty. Even if Dr. Murray wants to continue and no notice is given, EHS can still terminate the services, negating the renewal process.",

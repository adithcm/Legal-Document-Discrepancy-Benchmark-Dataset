Furthermore, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be considered Confidential Information of both Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, all Know-How and proprietary information relating to the Licensed Products generated by or on behalf of Bioeq and provided to Licensee hereunder shall be considered Confidential Information of Bioeq.",

Furthermore, only specific sections of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as explicitly marked and agreed upon in writing by both Parties, shall be considered Confidential Information. For the avoidance of doubt, all Know-How and proprietary information relating to the Licensed Products generated by or on behalf of Bioeq and provided to Licensee hereunder will generally be considered non-confidential, unless otherwise expressly designated in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that *all* terms and conditions of the agreement are confidential. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating *only specific sections* are confidential, and *only if explicitly marked*. It further muddles the waters by stating that Bioeq's Know-How is *generally non-confidential unless expressly designated*, which contradicts the initial broader definition. This creates uncertainty as to which parts of the agreement and Bioeq's information are protected.",

Licensee shall promptly inform Bioeq in writing of any Licensee Improvements promptly after such Licensee Improvements are developed or reduced to practice. Licensee hereby grants to Bioeq during the term of this Agreement (and, subject to Section 15.3.4, after termination or expiration of this Agreement) a non-exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable license (including the right to grant sublicenses) under all Intellectual Property Rights and Know-How Controlled by Licensee and embodied within, or claiming or covering the Licensee Improvements, to Develop, Manufacture, sell, import, or otherwise Commercialize Licensed Products outside of the Territory.

Licensee shall promptly inform Bioeq in writing of any Licensee Improvements promptly after such Licensee Improvements are developed or reduced to practice. Licensee may grant Bioeq a license for Licensee Improvements, with terms including royalty rates and exclusivity to be negotiated in good faith. Licensee is under no obligation to grant any license to Bioeq for these improvements. Bioeq's use of these improvements is contingent on reaching a separate agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Licensee *grants* a non-exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable license to Bioeq for Licensee Improvements. The modified text contradicts this by stating Licensee *may* grant a license, but is not obligated to, and that terms will be *negotiated*. This removes the guarantee of a license and creates uncertainty about Bioeq's access to Licensee Improvements.",

Renewal terms and conditions shall be re-negotiated and mutually agreed upon by both parties annually; otherwise, this Agreement will terminate automatically.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies an automatic renewal for an *unlimited period*. The modified text contradicts this by limiting renewal to a *year-by-year basis*, and requires a *notice of non-renewal*, and the terms have to be re-negotiated every year. It creates uncertainty about the duration of the agreement beyond the initial ten years.",

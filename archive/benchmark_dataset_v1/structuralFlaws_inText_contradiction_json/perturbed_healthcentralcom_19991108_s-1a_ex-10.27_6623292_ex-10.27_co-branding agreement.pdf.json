                "explanation": "The original text states that MediaLinx will not have access to HCI Personal Health Records during or after the term of the agreement. It also restricts the use of user data for competitive purposes for six months after the agreement ends. The modified text contradicts this by stating that MediaLinx will have access to HCI Personal Health Records during and after the term, and shall always use or publicly disclose the data collected. This creates uncertainty about the data ownership and usage rights.",

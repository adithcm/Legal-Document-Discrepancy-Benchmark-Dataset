                "original_text": "5.1. The rights granted Developer in this Agreement are subject to any prior territorial rights of other franchisees which may now exist in the Territory, whether or not those rights are currently being enforced. In the event of a conflict in territorial rights, whether under a Franchise Agreement or separate territorial or development agreement, Developer shall be free to negotiate with any person, corporation or other entity, which claims territorial rights adverse to the rights granted under this Agreement, for the assignment of those prior territorial rights. For this purpose, Franchisor agrees to approve any such assignment not in conflict with the other terms of this Agreement, subject to the condition of any Franchise Agreements involved, and current policies pertaining to assignments, including, but not limited to, satisfaction of all past due debts owed to Franchisor and the execution of a General Release.",

The rights granted Developer in this Agreement are subject to any prior territorial rights of other franchisees which may now exist in the Territory, whether or not those rights are currently being enforced. In the event of a conflict in territorial rights, whether under a Franchise Agreement or separate territorial or development agreement, Developer shall be free to negotiate with any person, corporation or other entity, which claims territorial rights adverse to the rights granted under this Agreement, for the assignment of those prior territorial rights. For this purpose, Franchisor may, at its sole discretion, approve or disapprove any such assignment regardless of conflict with the other terms of this Agreement, the condition of any Franchise Agreements involved, or current policies pertaining to assignments. The Franchisor's decision will be final and binding, with no recourse available to the Developer.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the franchisor's obligation to approve territorial rights assignments. The original text states that the franchisor agrees to approve assignments that do not conflict with the terms of the agreement. The modified text introduces complete discretion for the franchisor to approve or disapprove any assignment, regardless of the terms of the agreement. This creates uncertainty and contradicts the initial commitment to approve non-conflicting assignments.",

In such event, the Development Fee shall be forfeited to Franchisor in consideration of the rights granted in the Territory up to the time of termination. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, unless earlier terminated by either party, this Agreement shall expire on ______, 20___, and all rights of Developer herein shall cease and all unapplied or unused Development Fees paid pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall be forfeited to Franchisor.",

In such event, the Development Fee may be refunded to Developer at the sole discretion of El Pollo Loco, considering the extent to which the development rights have been utilized. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, unless earlier terminated by either party, this Agreement shall expire on ______, 20___, and all rights of Developer herein shall cease, however, unapplied or unused Development Fees paid pursuant to Section 3 hereof may be refunded to the Franchisor.",

The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the Development Fee “may be refunded” at the sole discretion of El Pollo Loco and unused fees may be refunded to the Franchisor, creating a direct contradiction regarding whether the fee is non-refundable or potentially refundable under certain circumstances and to whom.",

Immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, for any reason, all of Developer's development rights granted pursuant to this Agreement shall revert to El Pollo Loco.

Franchisor shall have no duty to execute any Franchise Agreement with Developer after the termination of this Agreement.

Immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, for any reason, all of Developer's development rights granted pursuant to this Agreement shall revert to El Pollo Loco, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by both parties at the time of termination. At the time of termination, only restaurants operating or to be operated under the El Pollo Loco® System by virtue of a fully executed Franchise Agreement shall be unaffected by the termination of this Agreement. Franchisor may consider executing Franchise Agreements with Developer after the termination of this Agreement, subject to the discretion of the Franchisor and based on the prevailing market conditions at the time.

                "explanation": "The original text states that upon termination all developer's rights revert to El Pollo Loco. The modified text adds \"unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by both parties at the time of termination\", which directly contradicts the previous statement. The original text states that the franchisor has no duty to execute franchise agreements. The modified text states \"The Franchisor may consider executing Franchise Agreements with Developer after the termination of this Agreement\", which also directly contradicts the previous statement. This change introduces an element of potential negotiation and continued rights, undermining the finality of the termination clause. This would create uncertainty regarding the extent to which El Pollo Loco maintains control and rights after termination.",

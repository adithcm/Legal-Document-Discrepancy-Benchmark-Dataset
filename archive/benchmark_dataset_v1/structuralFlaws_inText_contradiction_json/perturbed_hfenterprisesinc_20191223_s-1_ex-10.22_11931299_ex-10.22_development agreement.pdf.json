The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of\ntwelve (12) months (the “Initial Term”). The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30-\ndays advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any\nextension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the “Term”.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of\ntwelve (12) months (the “Initial Term”). The Initial Term will renew at the discretion of DSS, taking into account Developer performance. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any\nextension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the “Term”.",
                "explanation": "The original text indicates automatic renewal with a 30-day notice clause. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that renewal is at DSS's discretion, dependent on Developer performance. This contradicts the automatic renewal clause, making the term's length uncertain.",

Developer agrees that it will not at any time (i) do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way\nimpairing any part of such right, title and interest or (ii) represent, expressly or by implication that it has any right, title or interest in or to any of the\nforegoing other than as expressly set forth herein.",

Developer liability will be capped at the amount of fees paid by DSS to Developer under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stated that Developer's liability for damages is without limitation. The modified clause then introduces a cap on the liability, limiting it to the amount of fees paid.

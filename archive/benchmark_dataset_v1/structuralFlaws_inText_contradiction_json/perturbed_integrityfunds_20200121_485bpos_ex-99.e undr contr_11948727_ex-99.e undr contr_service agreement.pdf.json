                "original_text": "Section 7.1 This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods ending on January 18th of each year, provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the Fund’s Board of Trustees and (b) a vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund’s Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Plan, in this Agreement, or any agreement related to the Plan (the “Qualified Trustees”), by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval.",
                "changed_text": "Section 7.1 This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022, and thereafter will not automatically renew. Any renewal will be based on the sole discretion of Integrity Funds Distributor, LLC and subject to a renegotiation of terms. The Fund's Board of Trustees' approval is not required for any renewal.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause by stating that the agreement will NOT automatically renew, removing the condition of the Fund’s Board of Trustees approval for any renewal. This creates uncertainty about the renewal process and weakens the Fund's control over the agreement's continuation. It introduces a conflict regarding who has the authority to determine renewal terms.",

Integrity is authorized to make decisions on behalf of the fund without prior approval.",
                "explanation": "This directly contradicts the original clause which states that Integrity has no authority to act for or represent the Fund except when specifically authorized. The modified version grants Integrity broad authority to represent the Fund, unless specifically instructed otherwise. This creates uncertainty about the scope of Integrity's authority and the Fund's control over its own representation.",

For purposes of this Agreement, “distribution expenses” of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following:\n(a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services;\n(b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising;\n(c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund;\n(d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund;\n(e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and\n2\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n(f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a\ndealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares.\nDistribution expenses, however, shall not include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates,\nor any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.8 Integrity will bear all expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution expenses under this Agreement. The Fund will reimburse Integrity for certain distribution expenses, including costs related to marketing, advertising, and sales commissions, as agreed upon in writing by both parties. The specific amounts and conditions for reimbursement will be outlined in a separate addendum to this agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “distribution expenses” of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following:\n(a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services;\n(b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising;\n(c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund;\n(d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund;\n(e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and\n2\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n(f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a\ndealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares.\nDistribution expenses, however, shall not include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates,\nor any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Integrity bears all distribution expenses. The modification introduces a possibility for the Fund to reimburse Integrity for 'certain distribution expenses', contradicting the original statement. The ambiguity of 'as agreed upon in writing' and 'separate addendum' creates uncertainty about which expenses are actually Integrity's responsibility and to what extent the Fund is liable for reimbursement.",

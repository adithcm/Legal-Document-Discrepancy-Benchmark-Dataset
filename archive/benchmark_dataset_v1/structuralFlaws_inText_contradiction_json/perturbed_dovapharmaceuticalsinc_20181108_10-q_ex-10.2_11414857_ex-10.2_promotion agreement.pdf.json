                "changed_text": "10.1.9 it has the right to promote the Product in the Territory to the Target Professionals in the Specialty and the rights granted by it to Valeant hereunder may conflict with rights granted by Dova to some Third Parties prior to the execution of this agreement; Dova is not responsible for notifying Valeant of potential conflicts.",
                "explanation": "The original text asserts Dova's exclusive right and warrants no conflict with third-party rights. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that the rights 'may conflict' and that Dova is not responsible for notifying Valeant of potential conflicts. This contradicts the original assertion and creates uncertainty regarding Valeant's rights and Dova's obligations.",

Dova shall retain ownership of the rights to the Product; however, Valeant may book sales revenues and receive payments directly from clients, based on a separately negotiated agreement. Valeant shall be exclusively responsible for accepting and filling purchase orders, billing, and returns with respect to the Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Dova 'shall retain ownership' and record all revenues. The edited text states that Valeant may book sales revenue and be paid directly from clients, a contradiction of Dova holding exclusive sales revenue rights. Also in the original Dova shall be exclusively responsible for billing, orders, returns but in the edit, this switches over to Valeant.",

The breaching Party may attempt to cure the breach, but such attempts will not affect the termination.",
                "explanation": "The original states that a material breach must go uncured within a period of time before termination can occur, while the modified version states that termination is effective immediately upon notice, regardless of whether the breach is curable or cured. This creates a contradiction and therefore uncertainty about the termination process.",

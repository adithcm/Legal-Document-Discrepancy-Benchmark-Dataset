Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion. All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. Upon written notification by the Licensor",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark as permitted under this Agreement, including but not limited to usage as part of the Licensee’s own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. The Licensee may use the Licensed Mark and any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor.

                "explanation": "The original text grants a license solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's company name. The modified text removes the 'solely and exclusively' clause and adds language that the Licensee 'may use the Licensed Mark and any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor,' contradicting the limited usage initially granted. This introduces uncertainty as to the scope of the license and the control the Licensor retains over the Licensed Mark's usage.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall expire if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Licensee. This Agreement shall be terminable (a) by the Licensor (i) at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that the Licensor or the Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of the Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark or (ii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice by the Licensor to the Licensee or (b) by the Licensee (i) at any time in the event such Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of the Licensee’s rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor or (ii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice by the Licensee to the Licensor.",

The License granted can be terminated at any time by the licensee.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the license is perpetual but includes termination clauses. The modified text removes the initial condition for termination in which 'this Agreement shall expire if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment advisor to the Licensee'. Furthermore, the additional sentence 'The License granted can be terminated at any time by the licensee.' directly contradicts the earlier clause requiring 60 days' notice by the Licensee, creating ambiguity about the actual termination conditions. This introduces a contradiction concerning whether a 60 day notice is needed, or can the license be terminated at any time.",

The Licensee shall not sublicense, assign, pledge or grant as security or otherwise encumber or transfer to any third party all or any part of its rights or duties under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent from the Licensor, which consent the Licensor may grant or withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.

The Licensee shall not sublicense, assign, pledge or grant as security or otherwise encumber or transfer to any third party all or any part of its rights or duties under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent from the Licensor. The Licensor will not withhold consent from the Licensee without reasonable justification. Any purported transfer or other encumbrance without such consent shall be void ab initio.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides that the Licensor may grant or withhold consent in its sole and absolute discretion, meaning for any reason or no reason at all. The modified text removes the 'sole and absolute discretion' clause and adds the phrase 'The Licensor will not withhold consent from the Licensee without reasonable justification.' This directly contradicts the initial freedom to withhold consent for any reason, introducing a requirement for 'reasonable justification' that didn't exist before. This creates ambiguity as to the Licensor's actual power to deny assignment, opening to interpretation what constitutes a 'reasonable justification.'",

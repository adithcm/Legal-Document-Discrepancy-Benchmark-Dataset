                "original_text": "2.1 Licensor hereby grants Licensed Users a nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, royalty-free license, during the term of this Agreement, to use and display the Licensed Trade Name and the Licensed Mark in the United States solely in connection with the Licensee's corporate name and identifying mark.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Licensor hereby grants Licensed Users a nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, royalty-free license, during the term of this Agreement, to use and display the Licensed Trade Name and the Licensed Mark in the United States solely in connection with the Licensee's corporate name and identifying mark. Licensor reserves the right to revoke this license at any time, for any reason, with no prior notice required.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence gives the Licensor the right to revoke the granted license at any time without notice. This directly contradicts the 'during the term of this Agreement' clause, creating uncertainty about the actual duration and stability of the license.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor may terminate this agreement immediately if it deems Licensee to be acting in a manner adverse to Licensor, with no cure period.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires 30 days written notice for termination by either party. The added sentence allows Licensor to terminate immediately under a subjective standard ('acting in a manner adverse') without giving the Licensee an opportunity to correct its behavior. This creates a contradiction and significantly advantages the Licensor.",

LICENSOR DOES NOT MAKE WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER\nEXPRESS, IMPLIED, RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE LICENSED MARK OR THIS AGREEMENT. However, Licensor warrants that it has the right to grant the license provided herein and that the Licensed Mark does not infringe on any third party's intellectual property rights. This warranty is in lieu of all other warranties, express or implied.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that the Licensor makes no warranties of any kind. The added sentences then introduce a specific warranty regarding the right to grant the license and non-infringement. While it states 'in lieu of all other warranties', the existence of this specific warranty contradicts the earlier blanket disclaimer, creating ambiguity about the actual warranties provided.",

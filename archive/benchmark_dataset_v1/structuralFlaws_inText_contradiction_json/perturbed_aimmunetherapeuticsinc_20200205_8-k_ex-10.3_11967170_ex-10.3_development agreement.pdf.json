                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Product' provides specific criteria for what constitutes a product under the agreement and explicitly excludes certain Active Ingredients. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating 'A Product might include any Active Ingredient' which contradicts the explicit exclusion from the original definition. It also adds uncertainty through 'Product may exclude at Aimmune's discretion'.",

The determination of whether a claim is 'Valid' will be at Aimmune's sole discretion, irrespective of any decision by a court or Governmental Authority. A claim can still be considered Valid even if it has been specifically held permanently revoked, unenforceable, or invalid by a court or Governmental Authority. A claim can also be considered valid even if it has been cancelled, withdrawn, or abandoned without being re-filed. Aimmune's assessment will be final.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Valid Claim' relies on objective criteria such as decisions by courts or governmental authorities and the status of patent applications. The modified version introduces a direct contradiction by stating that Aimmune has sole discretion in determining validity, even overriding court decisions. This creates uncertainty in the Royalty payments.",

Xencor shall have the right, upon [***] ([***]) days’ prior written notice to Aimmune, to cause an independent, certified international public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Aimmune or reasonably acceptable to its Affiliates or Sublicensees, as applicable, to audit such records during Aimmune’s, or its Affiliate’s or Sublicensees’, as applicable, normal business hours to confirm the number of Product units sold, the gross sales and Net Sales of Product, the royalties payable, the method used to calculate the royalties payable, and the exchange rates used in accordance with Section 8.2.",
                "changed_text": "8.4 Records; Audits. During the Term, Aimmune will make reasonable efforts to keep records pertaining to the sale or other disposition of Product. Xencor's right to audit is subject to Aimmune's approval, which may be withheld at Aimmune's sole discretion. If an audit is permitted, Xencor must use auditors approved by Aimmune, and the scope of the audit will be determined solely by Aimmune. Aimmune is not obligated to provide access to records from Affiliates or Sublicensees.",
                "explanation": "The original clause gives Xencor a clear right to audit Aimmune's records. The modified version introduces several contradictions. First, it changes Aimmune's obligation to 'keep complete and accurate records' to 'make reasonable efforts'. Second, it makes Xencor's right to audit subject to Aimmune's approval, which can be withheld at Aimmune's sole discretion, effectively negating the right. Third, it limits the scope and choice of auditors to what Aimmune approves, restricting Xencor's ability to independently verify the sales data. The deletion of the requirements of Aimmune providing access to their Affiliates or Sublicensees is a huge change.",

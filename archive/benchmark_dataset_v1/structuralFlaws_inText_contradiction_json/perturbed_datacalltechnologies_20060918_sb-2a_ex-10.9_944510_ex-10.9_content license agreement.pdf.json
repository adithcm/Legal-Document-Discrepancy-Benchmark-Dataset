Additionally, Licensee shall have the  right  to  use  the trademarks, trade names, or logos relating to Content  (the  \"TRADEMARKS\").",

Licensee will require written consent from Licensor prior to using the trademarks, trade names, or logos relating to Content  (the  \"TRADEMARKS\").",
                "explanation": "The original text grants plan_b the right to use trademarks related to the content, but the modified version introduces a condition requiring written consent from LICENSOR before using the trademarks.

The Initial Term shall automatically be extended  for  an additional period of half a year unless either party provides  the  other party with written notification of termination of the  letter  Agreement  at  least 60 days prior to end of such period.",

The Initial Term shall automatically be extended  for  an additional period of half a year unless both parties provide written consent to extend the letter Agreement at least 60 days prior to end of such period.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states automatic renewal for an additional period of half a year unless *either* party provides written notice of termination. The modified version contradicts this by stating that the Initial Term shall automatically be extended only if *both* parties provide written consent to extend. This changes the condition from unilateral termination prevention to requiring bilateral approval for extension, creating a contradiction and uncertainty about the renewal process.",

The modified version changes this mandatory reporting to discretionary reporting, where the record *may* be provided at plan_b's discretion. This creates an internal contradiction about plan_b's obligation to provide the detailed report.",

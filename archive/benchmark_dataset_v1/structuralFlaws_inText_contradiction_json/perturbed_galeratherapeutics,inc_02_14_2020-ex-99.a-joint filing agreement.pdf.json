                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto. This revocation will be instantaneous and apply to all parties involved, regardless of whether they consent to the revocation.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that revocation only applies to the revoking party. The changed text contradicts this by stating that revocation is instantaneous and affects all parties. This creates uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated and to whom the termination applies.",

The modified text contradicts this by making each party fully responsible for *all* information, regardless of their knowledge of its accuracy. This creates uncertainty as to the extent of liability each party assumes when entering the agreement.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this agreement does not cover any filings related to equity securities issued after the date of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement applies to any filing required under Section 13 of the Exchange Act with respect to Galera Therapeutics, Inc. The added sentence introduces a contradiction by stating that the agreement does not cover filings related to equity securities issued *after* the agreement date. This creates ambiguity about which filings are actually covered by the agreement, particularly concerning future issuances of equity. It's unclear whether filings for equity issued today *are* included, because of the explicit carveout for later equity.",

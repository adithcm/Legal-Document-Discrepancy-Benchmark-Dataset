                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party B shall follow all instructions of Party A and ensure all plans and designs of the project to meet relevant construction laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall endeavor to follow instructions of Party A where feasible, considering Party B's professional judgment, and shall aim for plans and designs to generally align with construction laws and regulations, acknowledging that strict adherence may not always be possible or in the best interest of the project.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates Party B to strictly follow all instructions from Party A and ensure complete compliance with construction laws. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating 'endeavor to follow' and 'generally align,' thereby creating a contradiction. It weakens Party B's obligation to follow instructions and meet regulations, potentially leading to disputes over the level of compliance required.",

                "original_text": "In case the Contract cannot be performed due to any reason other than the architect herein, the client agrees the fees paid will not be refunded. In case the Contract cannot be performed due to the architect herein, the architect shall refund the fees paid in full without taking any interest to the client.",
                "changed_text": "In case the Contract cannot be fully performed, the fees paid may or may not be refunded, depending on the circumstances of the non-performance and at the sole discretion of Party A. In certain cases, Party A may deduct a portion of the fees to cover expenses incurred. If the contract is terminated due to the architect's gross negligence, a partial refund, as determined by Party A, may be issued.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original clear refund policy. The original text specifies clear conditions for refund based on the responsible party. The modified text makes refunds discretionary, contradicting the original mandatory refund in specific situations. It favors Party A's interests and can lead to disputes about refunds, particularly if the project fails due to reasons attributable to the architect but not classified as gross negligence.",

                "original_text": "Both parties herein agree to resolve any dispute regarding interpretation of the Contract in the following methods: I. Should both Parties be unable to reach an agreement within one month through negotiation, they may apply for an arbitration in Miaoli County and the arbitration result shall be compulsory. II. Should either Party herein initiate a legal proceeding for revoking any arbitration result regarding the Contract, both Parties herein agree to take the Miaoli District Court of Taiwan as the competent court of first instance pursuant to the laws of the R.O.C..",
                "changed_text": "Both parties herein agree to attempt to resolve any dispute regarding interpretation of the Contract through negotiation. However, either party retains the right to pursue legal action directly, without prior arbitration, in a court of their choosing. The prevailing party in any legal dispute will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration as a compulsory step before legal proceedings. The modified version allows either party to bypass arbitration entirely and pursue legal action directly, contradicting the original agreement. This undermines the initial intent to resolve disputes through arbitration, potentially leading to increased legal costs and a more adversarial resolution process. It creates conflicting terms regarding dispute resolution.",

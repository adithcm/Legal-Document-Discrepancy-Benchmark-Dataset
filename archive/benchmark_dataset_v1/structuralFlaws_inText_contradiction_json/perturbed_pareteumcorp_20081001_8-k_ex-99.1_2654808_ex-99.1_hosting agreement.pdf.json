After the initial period, the agreement may or may not be extended.\n17.2\nThe Agreement may be terminated by either Parties at any point, or it may continue indefinitely, subject to negotiations and agreement.

                "explanation": "The original text implies an automatic renewal with a specific notification period. The modified version contradicts this by stating that extension is not guaranteed and termination is possible at any point, thus creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration and renewal conditions.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear definition for 'Quarter' and 'Ready for Service Date'. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that 'Quarter' may mean any duration agreed upon and making the meeting of specifications for the 'Ready for Service Date' subject to T-Mobile's discretion, effectively contradicting the original specific definitions and creating uncertainty.",

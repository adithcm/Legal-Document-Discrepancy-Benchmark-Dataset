                "explanation": "The original text sets a definitive expiration date. By adding \"and may be extended by mutual agreement for subsequent periods,\" we introduce uncertainty. It is no longer clear if the agreement automatically expires on the Scheduled Expiration Date, or if it can be extended indefinitely. This contradicts the original intention of a fixed term and requires an agreement for expiration.",

The modified version removes these specific amounts and states the Annual Fee will be determined yearly by the Club.

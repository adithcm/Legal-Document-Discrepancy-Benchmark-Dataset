                "original_text": "The Blockchain Administrator agrees to maintain and keep all books, accounts and other records of the Fund that relate to activities\nperformed by the Blockchain Administrator hereunder and will maintain and keep such books, accounts and records in accordance with the\nInvestment Company Act. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, the Blockchain Administrator\nagrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund shall at all times remain the property of the Fund, shall be readily accessible during normal\nbusiness hours, and shall be promptly surrendered upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request. The Blockchain\nAdministrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be\npreserved for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided\nabove. Records shall be surrendered in usable machine-readable form. The Blockchain Administrator shall have the right to retain copies of such\nrecords subject to observance of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Blockchain Administrator agrees to maintain and keep certain books, accounts and other records of the Fund that relate to activities performed by the Blockchain Administrator hereunder as deemed necessary by the Blockchain Administrator and will maintain and keep such books, accounts, and records in a manner that it deems reasonable. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, the Blockchain Administrator agrees that only those records which it chooses to maintain for the Fund shall remain its property. The Blockchain Administrator will provide access to the Fund's records at its own discretion. The Blockchain Administrator further agrees that the preservation of the Fund's records under Rule 31a-1 will be based on its internal policy. The Blockchain Administrator may retain such records indefinitely and is under no obligation to surrender them in a machine-readable format.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the Blockchain Administrator maintain *all* records related to its activities in compliance with the Investment Company Act, ensuring the Fund's ownership, accessibility, and proper preservation. The modified version introduces significant contradictions. By stating that the Blockchain Administrator will maintain only *certain* records it deems necessary, the *nature* of the records kept become uncertain. Further, asserting that the *records* it maintains remain its property directly *contradicts* the Fund's ownership rights. By undermining the accessibility and preservation terms, the modification creates uncertainty about whether the Blockchain Administrator will fulfill its record-keeping duties to the detriment of the Fund. This uncertainty could lead to conflicts and disputes over record access and accountability.",

                "original_text": "In full consideration of the provision of the services of the Blockchain Administrator set forth herein, the Fund shall pay the\nBlockchain Administrator a fees calculated at the annual rate of 0.20% of the value of the Fund’s average annual net assets. Such fee shall be\naccrued daily and paid monthly in arrears.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the provision of the services of the Blockchain Administrator set forth herein, the Fund may pay the Blockchain Administrator a fee determined at the Blockchain Administrator's sole discretion, not exceeding 0.20% of the value of the Fund’s assets. Such fee will be accrued and paid on a schedule determined by the Blockchain Administrator.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Fund *shall* pay the Blockchain Administrator a fee calculated at a fixed annual rate of 0.20%, accrued daily, and paid monthly in arrears. The modified version introduces uncertainty and shifts control to the Blockchain Administrator. By using 'may pay' instead of 'shall pay', it becomes unclear whether the Blockchain Administrator will receive any compensation. Moreover, allowing the Blockchain Administrator to determine the fee within a limit and decide on the payment schedule directly *contradicts* the original terms. This creates uncertainty regarding the compensation due to the Blockchain Administrator and the financial obligations of the Fund, potentially leading to disputes over payment terms and amounts.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without\nthe payment of any penalty, upon 60 days' written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or by the vote\nof the Fund's Trustees or by the Blockchain Administrator.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, with penalties to be determined by the Blockchain Administrator, upon 60 days' written notice by the Blockchain Administrator. The Fund may also terminate this agreement, but only under conditions deemed acceptable by the Blockchain Administrator and subject to penalties as determined by the Blockchain Administrator",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that either the Fund (through a majority vote of its securities or Trustees) or the Blockchain Administrator can terminate the agreement with 60 days' notice and without penalty. The revised text drastically alters the termination terms. It gives the Blockchain Administrator the power to impose penalties on the Fund upon termination, contradicting the original 'without penalty' clause. It also limits the Fund's ability to terminate, stating it can only do so 'under conditions deemed acceptable by the Blockchain Administrator', and is still subject to penalties. This creates uncertainty and bias in the termination process, putting the Fund at a significant disadvantage and leading to potential disputes over termination conditions and penalties.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that approval from the HOF Entities for advertising materials shall not be \"unreasonably withheld.\" The modified version removes this clause, stating the approval is at the HOF Entities \"sole discretion.\" This creates a contradiction as the HOF Entities are not obligated to act reasonably in their approvals, giving them more control and creating uncertainty for Constellation.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that unused activation funds cannot be rolled into future contract years. The modified text introduces the possibility of rolling funds over \"at the HOF Entities Discretion.\" This creates a contradiction regarding the use of unused funds.

                "explanation": "The original text allows either party to terminate the agreement based on potential reputational damage. The modified text changes this by giving the HOF Entities the right to terminate based on their \"sole opinion,\" removing the \"reasonable\" qualifier, but Constellation can only terminate if the HOF Entities break Section 3.3.

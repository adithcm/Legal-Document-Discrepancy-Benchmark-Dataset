The duration of this Venture (the “Term”) will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025 or as\notherwise provided in this Agreement.\n5. The Term may be extended at the sole discretion of the Managers, regardless of Member consent.",
                "explanation": "Section 4 states the Term ends February 28, 2025, or as otherwise provided. Section 5 originally required unanimous consent for extension. The modified Section 5 contradicts this by stating the Term can be extended at the sole discretion of the Managers, overriding the need for Member consent. This creates uncertainty as to whether unanimous consent is actually required to extend the agreement beyond the initial term, potentially leading to disputes about the agreement's validity after February 28, 2025.",

Within the limits of the Purpose of the Venture and the terms of this Agreement, the Managers, acting jointly, will have full authority to\nbind the Members in all matters relating to the direction, control and management of the Venture. Conduct and actions of the Managers\nwill be dictated by policy and procedure established by the Members. Authority to bind the Venture in contract or in any third party\nbusiness relation lies exclusively with the Managers, acting jointly.\n11. The Managers will jointly decide major issues concerning the Venture. Where Managers are unable to reach agreement in deciding major\nissues, approval by a majority vote of the Members at a regular or special meeting will be required.",

Authority to bind the Venture in contract or in any third party\nbusiness relation lies exclusively with each of the Managers, acting independently.\n11. The Managers will decide major issues concerning the Venture. Where a Manager makes a decision, it will be binding regardless of agreement from other Managers or approval of the Members.",
                "explanation": "Section 10 originally stated that the Managers must act jointly to bind the Members, and actions are dictated by policies set by the *Members*. Section 11 required a majority vote from Members if Managers disagreed on major issues. This change removes the 'acting jointly' requirement, now granting each Manager individual authority to bind the members. The policies and procedures are now established by *Managers* instead of Members. Further, it removes the need for Member approval in case of disagreement. This contradicts the original intent of requiring collaboration and Member oversight, leading to uncertainty over decision-making processes and authority delegation.",

The new Member agrees to be\nbound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments.

New Members may be admitted into the Venture with a simple majority vote from the existing Members. The new Member agrees to be\nbound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new\nMember will execute such documents as are needed or required for this admission. Any new Member will receive a business interest in the\nVenture as determined by BorrowMoney.com, inc.",
                "explanation": "Section 28 originally stated that each member receives one vote carrying equal weight. The changed text assigns 75% of the vote to BorrowMoney.com, Inc, and 25% of the vote to JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go. This directly contradicts the equal weight provision. Section 30 originally stated that any new member can only be added with unanimous consent by the existing members. The new text allows a simple majority vote for the addition of new members. This change also stipulates that the business interest of the new member will be determined solely by BorrowMoney.com, inc, which contradicts the requirement that the interest be determined by all other members. This raises questions about the fairness of member votes and the admission process of new members.",

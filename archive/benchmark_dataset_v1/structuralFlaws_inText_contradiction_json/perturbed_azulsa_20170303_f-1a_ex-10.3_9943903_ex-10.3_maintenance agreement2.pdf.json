                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall enter into force on the date of its signature by both Parties. The duration of this amendment will be determined on a project-by-project basis and subject to the discretion of ATR, regardless of the term of the referenced GMA.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the Amendment remains in force for the term of the GMA. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the duration is determined on a project-by-project basis at ATR's discretion, contradicting the initial fixed term and creating ambiguity around the duration obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Confidentiality clause lasts for five years after the contract's end. The modified text creates a contradiction by stating that it lasts indefinitely, unless both parties agree to end the agreement, making it unclear what the duration is. This allows AZUL to have complete discretion over the confidentiality obligations.",

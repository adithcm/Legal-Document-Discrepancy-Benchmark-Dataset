                "original_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to not edit or modify the above content.",
                "changed_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to not edit or modify the above content, except as required to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. Any such modifications must be approved by Watchit in writing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld; however, Oceanic Time Warner Cable may make necessary edits to comply with broadcast standards.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original text states that Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees 'to not edit or modify the above content.' The added clause allows for edits to comply with legal/regulatory needs and broadcast standards, thereby directly contradicting the initial prohibition on editing. This creates uncertainty about the extent to which Oceanic Time Warner Cable can alter the content.",

However, this cancellation fee is waived if the termination is due to unforeseen circumstances or a material breach by Watchit.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the cancellation fee. The original text stipulates a clear cancellation fee. The added clause provides exceptions (unforeseen circumstances, material breach by Watchit) where the fee is waived, creating ambiguity about when the fee actually applies. The term 'unforeseen circumstances' is vague and creates significant uncertainty.",

However, Oceanic Time Warner Cable retains final approval over all advertising and branding elements to ensure compliance with their advertising standards.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding advertising control. The original text grants Watchit 'exclusive right' to sell advertising. The added clause gives Oceanic Time Warner Cable 'final approval,' effectively undermining Watchit's exclusive right. This introduces uncertainty about who ultimately controls advertising and branding decisions.",

                "original_text": "Reseller means an authorized reseller of Distributor that meets Cisco's then-current requirements for resellers, including, without limitation, the requirements set out in Section 26.0 of this Agreement. In the event Cisco enters into authorization agreements whereby Cisco authorizes particular resellers to purchase Products or Services from Distributor and to resell Products or Services to End User, then \"Reseller\" shall mean a reseller that is a party to such an authorization agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller means any entity purchasing products from the Distributor. Resellers do not need to meet Cisco's requirements, unless explicitly stated by Cisco. In the event Cisco enters into authorization agreements whereby Cisco authorizes particular resellers to purchase Products or Services from Distributor and to resell Products or Services to End User, then \"Reseller\" shall mean a reseller that is a party to such an authorization agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that a Reseller must meet Cisco's current requirements as outlined in Section 26.0. The modified text contradicts this by stating that resellers don't need to meet those requirements, unless explicitly stated by Cisco. This introduces ambiguity as to what conditions Resellers must meet to be authorized.",

Distributor agrees to use its best efforts to distribute Product solely to Resellers located in the Territory. Those Resellers may resell Product only to End Users who intend to use the Product in the Territory. All Resellers to which Distributor distributes Product must meet Cisco's then-current guidelines for Resellers, as amended from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 By this Agreement, Cisco makes, and Distributor accepts, the appointment of Distributor as an authorized, non-exclusive distributor of Products and Services to Resellers located in the Territory. Distributor is encouraged but not required to use its best efforts to distribute Product solely to Resellers located in the Territory. Those Resellers may resell Product to End Users regardless of the End User's location or intent to use the product in the Territory. There are no specific requirements for Resellers that the Distributor needs to enforce.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Distributor to distribute only to Resellers in the territory who then resell to End Users within the territory. The modified text states the Distributor is only encouraged to do so. The original text also specifies that the distributor needs to ensure that Resellers must meet Cisco's guidelines, but the modified text states there are no specific requirements. This contradicts the limited distribution territory creating ambiguity.",

All notices required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed given one (1) day after deposit with a commercial express courier specifying next day delivery (or two (2) days for international courier packages specifying 2-day delivery), with written verification of receipt. All communications will be sent to the addresses set forth on the cover sheet of this Agreement or such other address as may be designated by a party by giving written notice to the other party pursuant to this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notices regarding general changes in product status, pricing, policies, financial transactions or programs may also be made by posting on Cisco.com or delivery by e-mail or fax, as applicable. Cisco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Distributor [*****] notice when introducing new Programs or Product or modifying Product pricing. Any notice regarding discontinuation of Product shall be pursuant to Cisco's then-current End of Life Policy, as found at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products end-of-life policy.html. A current copy of this policy, as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, is attached hereto as Exhibit G. [*****].",

All notices required or permitted under this Agreement will be deemed sufficiently given when sent via any method of communication, including but not limited to verbal communication, email, fax, or carrier pigeon, and shall be effective immediately. The method of notice shall be at the sole discretion of the notifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cisco may choose to use only telepathy to inform the distributor. Cisco is not responsible for any failure to receive the notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that all notices must be in writing and delivered by commercial express courier with written verification. The modified text contradicts this by allowing any form of communication, negating the requirement for written notice and verifiable receipt. This change creates uncertainty about whether notice was successfully given and the validity of the agreement.",

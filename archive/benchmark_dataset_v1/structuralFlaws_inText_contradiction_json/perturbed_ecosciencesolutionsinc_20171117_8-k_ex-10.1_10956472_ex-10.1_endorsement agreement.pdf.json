                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date. Renewal of this agreement is subject to mutual written agreement by both parties, submitted at least thirty days prior to the anniversary of the Effective Date. If no such agreement is reached, this agreement will terminate on the anniversary of the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement auto-renews unless a thirty-day notice of termination is provided. The modified text changes this to renewal requiring mutual written agreement, contradicting the auto-renewal clause and creating uncertainty regarding the agreement's duration.",

                "changed_text": "ESSI may provide Talent with up to one-million (1,000,000) shares of restricted common stock. The exact number of shares, if any, to be issued is at ESSI's sole discretion and will be determined within thirty business days of execution of this Agreement based on Talent's initial performance, as determined by ESSI. The issuance of any shares is contingent upon Talent signing a separate agreement regarding the terms and conditions of the stock grant.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that ESSI 'will provide' a specific number of shares. The modified text replaces 'will provide' with 'may provide' and makes the share issuance discretionary, contingent on ESSI's evaluation of Talent's performance and a separate agreement. This contradicts the initial commitment and makes the compensation uncertain. The requirement for a separate agreement adds further uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "Talent may use said materials in whole or in part for any purpose, including commercial use, provided that ESSI receives a royalty of 10% of any revenue generated from such use. ESSI retains the right to approve all uses of the materials in advance, with approval not to be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "The original text restricts Talent's use of the materials to showcasing their work in a portfolio and explicitly prohibits selling or transferring the materials. The modified text allows commercial use with a royalty payment and ESSI's approval, directly contradicting the original restrictions and introducing ambiguity about Talent's rights.",

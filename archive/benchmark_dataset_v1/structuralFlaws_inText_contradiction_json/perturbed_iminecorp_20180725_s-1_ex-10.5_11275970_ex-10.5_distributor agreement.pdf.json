Confidential Information may also include\noral information disclosed by one party to the other pursuant to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Section 1.1 originally stated that Confidential Information may include oral information. The modification explicitly excludes oral information from the definition of Confidential Information, creating a contradiction within the definition itself. This could lead to disputes over whether oral communications are protected under the confidentiality clauses of the agreement.",

Except as set forth in the last sentence of this Section 12.3, if either party defaults in the\nperformance of any material provision of this Agreement, then the non-defaulting party may give written notice to the defaulting\nparty that if the default is not cured within thirty (30) days the Agreement will be terminated.",

                "explanation": "Section 12.3 previously stated a thirty (30) day period to cure the agreement. The change alters the period to ninety (90) days to cure the agreement. This creates a contradiction between 12.2 and 12.3 because both termination clauses can operate, and cause ambiguity in the case of a breach. One clause dictates that the agreement is terminated after ninety (90) days for convenience and 12.3 dictates after a breach and a default in that termination after the ninety (90) day cure period.",

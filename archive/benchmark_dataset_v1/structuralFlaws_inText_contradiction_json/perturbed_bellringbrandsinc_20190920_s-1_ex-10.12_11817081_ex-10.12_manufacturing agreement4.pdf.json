Notwithstanding the foregoing, Heritage may unilaterally modify the Agreement with 30 days written notice to Premier.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause states that all other terms remain in effect. The added sentence allows Heritage to unilaterally modify the agreement, contradicting the requirement for mutual agreement implied in the original agreement and the statement that all other terms remain in effect. This creates uncertainty about the stability of the contract terms.",

By giving premier the unilateral power to interpret the terms, undermines the existing process. This creates uncertainty about how premier might at any point change the interpretation of the terms.",

Party B’s use of the \nProgram Content shall be in strict compliance with Party A’s requirements.",
                "changed_text": "6.1 When providing the Program Content to Party B, Party A may specify the special purpose for which such Program Content shall be used. However, Party B shall have ultimate discretion on the extent to which such Program Content shall be transmitted, the time or times at which such Program Content shall be transmitted \n(including the time at which such Program Content is published on the Phoenix Satellite TV Website or Other \n Websites, or the time at which such Program Content is licensed to any third party by Party B), and the manner by which such Program \nContent shall be transmitted (including the manner by which such Program Content is published on the Phoenix Satellite TV Websites \nor Other Websites, or the manner in which such Program Content shall be used by the licensed third party). Party B’s use of the \nProgram Content shall generally align with Party A's guidance but remains at Party B's sole determination.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Party B's use of the Program Content must strictly comply with Party A's requirements. The modified version introduces a contradiction by granting Party B 'ultimate discretion' and 'sole determination' regarding transmission extent, timing, and manner, effectively negating the strict compliance requirement and creating uncertainty about the enforceability of Party A's specifications.",

The licensee shall have an equal right to decide \nthe extension of the term hereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the licensee does not have the right to decide the extension of the term. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating the licensee *does* have an equal right to decide the extension of the term, creating uncertainty about the renewal process.",

                "explanation": "The original text states Party B *may not* assign rights without Party A's *consent*. The modified version allows assignment with only *notification,* but also states Party A retains *final approval*, then adds an *exception* for acquisitions where such approval is not needed. This creates a three-way conflict; Party B can assign with notification but still needs approval, except when acquired where no consent is needed.",

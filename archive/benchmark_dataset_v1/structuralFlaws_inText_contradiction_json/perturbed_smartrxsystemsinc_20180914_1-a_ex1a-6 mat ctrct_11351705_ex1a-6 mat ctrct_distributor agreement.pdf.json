                "explanation": "The original text grants exclusive distributorship to A3 Development Group in Texas. The modification introduces the possibility that the Company can appoint other distributors in Texas, directly contradicting the exclusivity provision and creating uncertainty about the extent of A3's exclusive rights.",

(Master Distributor Override (\"MDO\") shall mean Total Revenue per Customer Kiosk Location collected by SRXS from third party payors and patient cash payments). This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a positive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the revenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor.",

(Master Distributor Override (\"MDO\") shall mean Total Revenue per Customer Kiosk Location collected by SRXS from third party payors and patient cash payments). The exact percentage of the total revenue, and its disbursement schedule, will be determined by the Company based on performance metrics and profitability assessments, and are subject to change at the Company's discretion with 30 days' notice to the distributor.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear payment structure. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that the Company can alter the percentage and disbursement schedule based on unspecified 'performance metrics and profitability assessments.' This contradicts the initial commitment to a fixed percentage and creates uncertainty about the distributor's actual earnings.",

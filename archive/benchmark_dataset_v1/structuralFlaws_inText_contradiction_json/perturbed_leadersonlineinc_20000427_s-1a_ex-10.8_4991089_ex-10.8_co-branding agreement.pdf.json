Confidential Information shall mean, subject to the provisions of Section 9.2  [Exclusions], all proprietary and confidential information of a Party, including, without limitation, trade secrets, technical information, business information, sales information, customer and potential customer lists and identities, product sales plans, sublicense agreements, inventions, developments, discoveries, software, know-how, methods, techniques, formulae, data, processes and other proprietary ideas, whether or not protectable under patent, trademark, copyright or other areas of law, that the other Party has access to or receives. For purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be considered Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "1.4.  Confidential Information shall mean all information a Party considers confidential, which may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, technical information, business information, sales information, customer and potential customer lists and identities, product sales plans, sublicense agreements, inventions, developments, discoveries, software, know-how, methods, techniques, formulae, data, processes and other proprietary ideas, whether or not protectable under patent, trademark, copyright or other areas of law, that the other Party has access to or receives. For purposes of this Agreement, only explicitly marked documents will be considered Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "The original text definitively states that the 'Agreement shall be considered Confidential Information'. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'only explicitly marked documents will be considered Confidential Information', contradicting the initial, broader definition. This creates uncertainty regarding what information is actually protected under the confidentiality clause.",

During the Term of this Agreement, LeadersOnline agrees to purchase from VerticalNet Banners and Newsletter Ads for a total price of at least *** ($***).  All prices for such Banners and Newsletter Ads shall be offered to LeadersOnline at a ***% discount off of VerticalNet's then current prices for similar Banners or Newsletters Ads.

Prices for such Banners and Newsletter Ads shall be at VerticalNet's discretion, and may or may not include a discount. All purchases shall be subject to VerticalNet's standard terms and conditions, as amended from time to time, governing advertising on VerticalNet Sites.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits LeadersOnline to a minimum purchase amount and guarantees a specific discount. The modified text removes the purchase commitment by using \"may purchase\" instead of \"agrees to purchase,\" and eliminates the guaranteed discount, giving VerticalNet complete pricing discretion. This contradicts the original text, creating uncertainty about LeadersOnline's obligations and VerticalNet's pricing policy.",

LeadersOnline shall have the option, subject to VerticalNet's approval exercised in its sole  and absolute discretion, to extend the Term of this Agreement for an additional 12 months (a \"Renewal Term\") on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. To exercise this option, LeadersOnline must notify VerticalNet in writing of its election no later than 90 days prior to the expiration of the initial Term. Unless VerticalNet notifies LeadersOnline of its intention to extend the initial Term of this Agreement for an additional year within 30 days of receiving such notice the Agreement shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.",

LeadersOnline may request an extension to the Term of this Agreement for an additional 12 months (a \"Renewal Term\"), and VerticalNet will consider this request. VerticalNet may, at any time before or after the expiration of the initial term, offer LeadersOnline an extension to the Term on such terms and conditions as VerticalNet deems appropriate, or that may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Any notification by LeadersOnline shall be considered, however VerticalNet is under no obligation to respond within 30 days of receiving notice of election to extend the agreement, and the agreement may automatically renew at VerticalNet's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides LeadersOnline with an 'option' to extend, subject to VerticalNet's approval, and creates a clear timeline for both parties to act. The modified text turns this 'option' into a mere 'request,' removes the timeline for response, and introduces the possibility of automatic renewal at VerticalNet's discretion. This contradicts the initial condition that renewal is based on LeadersOnline's decision, creating uncertainty and granting VerticalNet complete control over the renewal process.",

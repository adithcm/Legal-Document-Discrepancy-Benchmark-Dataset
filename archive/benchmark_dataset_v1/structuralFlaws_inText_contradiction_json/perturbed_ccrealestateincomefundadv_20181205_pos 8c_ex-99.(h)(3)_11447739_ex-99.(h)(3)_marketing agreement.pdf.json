                "explanation": "The original text states the Distributor 'may compensate' S2K, but then describes a specific process for determining the amount of compensation and facilitating payments. The modification introduces uncertainty by stating that the compensation is 'at the Distributor's sole discretion, and is not guaranteed'. This directly contradicts the implication of a defined compensation structure, making it unclear whether S2K is entitled to any specific payment.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for termination by either party with 60 days' notice. The modification adds 'Termination may only occur upon mutual written agreement between both parties, irrespective of the aforementioned conditions.' This directly contradicts the ability of one party to unilaterally terminate the agreement by requiring mutual consent, even if the 60-day notice is given or a Distribution Agreement is terminated. This creates uncertainty about the actual termination process.",

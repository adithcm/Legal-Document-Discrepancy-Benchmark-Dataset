                "explanation": "The original text stated that the JV Agreement would terminate in its entirety with respect to Veoneer Parties. The modified version introduces uncertainty by adding \"unless otherwise decided by the Nissin Parties\" and \"subject to the discretion of the Nissin Parties\". This contradicts the prior statement and creates uncertainty about whether the Veoneer Parties are actually released from the agreement, potentially leading to disputes.",

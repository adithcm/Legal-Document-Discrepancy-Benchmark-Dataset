This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales\nTerm” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar\nDeveloper, LLC (the “Term”).”",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date. The non-solicitation term will continue indefinitely, unless both Parties mutually agree in writing to terminate it earlier. The details regarding termination will be subject to a separate agreement.”",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the term of the non-solicitation agreement by referencing the Sales Dealer Agreement. The modified version contradicts this by stating that the non-solicitation term continues indefinitely unless mutually terminated, creating uncertainty about the agreement's end date. This makes it difficult to determine when the non-solicitation obligations cease to apply.",

Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition\nAgreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.",

Even if not explicitly modified, sections of the Non-Competition Agreement may be subject to reinterpretation based on current business needs. Except as ambiguously stated in this Amendment, the Non-Competition Agreement may continue with revisions.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that the Amendment only applies to specifically referenced provisions, maintaining the original agreement's integrity. The modified text introduces uncertainty by granting Vivint Solar discretion to apply the amendment to unreferenced provisions and hinting at potential reinterpretations based on 'current business needs'. This contradicts the original intent of preserving the agreement's original terms and creates ambiguity.",

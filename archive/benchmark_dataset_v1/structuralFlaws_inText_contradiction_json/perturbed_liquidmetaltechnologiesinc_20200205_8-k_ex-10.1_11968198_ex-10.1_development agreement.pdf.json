                "original_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Term”), unless the Agreement is sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the expiration of the Term, the Term shall automatically extend for successive 12-month periods until one Party terminates the Agreement by providing at least 180 days prior written notice to the other Party prior to the expiration of the then-current term or unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Term”), unless the Agreement is sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the expiration of the Term, the Term may extend for successive 12-month periods if both Parties agree in writing 30 days before the current term expires, or unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement automatically extends for successive 12-month periods unless terminated by either party with 180 days' notice. The modified version contradicts this by requiring both parties to agree in writing 30 days prior to expiration for the term to extend. This creates uncertainty about the renewal process, as it's unclear whether the agreement automatically renews or requires mutual consent, making enforcement ambiguous.",

The foregoing representations and warranties shall survive delivery, inspection and payment and shall run in favor of Liquidmetal and its Affiliates, and their respective successors, assigns and customers, both direct and indirect.",
                "changed_text": "Eutectix warrants that the Product (i) will conform to the Specifications to a reasonable extent, (ii) will be free from significant manufacturing defects (including all defects in workmanship and any defects in materials that were not specified by Liquidmetal or Customer), ) will be free and clear of all known liens, encumbrances, charges, claims, or adverse interests of any kind, (iii) will comply with, in all stages of manufacture and distribution to Liquidmetal or Customer, the terms of Section 10. The foregoing representations and warranties shall survive delivery, inspection and payment and shall run in favor of Liquidmetal and its Affiliates, and their respective successors, assigns and customers, both direct and indirect.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear and strong warranty that the product 'will conform to the Specifications' and 'will be free from manufacturing defects'. The modified version introduces ambiguity and weakens the warranty by stating the product will conform 'to a reasonable extent' and be free from 'significant manufacturing defects' and 'all known liens'. These subjective qualifiers create uncertainty about the extent of Eutectix's obligations and weaken Liquidmetal's protection, as it becomes unclear what level of non-conformity or what kind of defects are acceptable, potentially leading to disputes over warranty claims. The addition of the word \"known\" with respect to liens, encumbrances, charges, claims, or adverse interests, allows Eutectix to not be held liable if there are unknown liens, encumbrances, charges, claims, or adverse interests.",

                "changed_text": "Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Eutectix may request to purchase some or all of the Licensed Equipment at a price to be determined by Liquidmetal, and Liquidmetal has sole discretion to sell or not sell to Eutectix, except the equipment listed under Section 2.1(b) above.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Eutectix has the 'option to purchase' the equipment at fair market value, establishing a right for Eutectix. The modified version removes this right and introduces the concept of Liquidmetal having sole discretion whether or not to sell. This directly contradicts the original text by changing a right into a mere possibility dependent on Liquidmetal's decision, creating uncertainty for Eutectix regarding their ability to acquire the equipment upon termination.",

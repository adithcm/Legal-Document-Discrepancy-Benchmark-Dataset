                "explanation": "The original agreement defines a 'Perpetual, unlimited runs' license term, or alternatively, a 2-year license. The added clause allows ConvergTV to terminate the license at any time, contradicting the 'Perpetual' term and introducing uncertainty about the actual length of the agreement. It is unclear if 'Perpetual' means 'Perpetual unless ConvergTV decides otherwise'.",

During the License Term (which is identified in the Deal\nTerms), Producer agrees that ConvergTV has the exclusive right to exercise the rights granted to it under this Agreement with respect to the\nProgram, including those in Section 1, within the Licensed Territory.",
                "changed_text": "4.\nProgram Exclusivity For The License Term Within The Licensed Territory . During the License Term (which is identified in the Deal\nTerms), Producer agrees that ConvergTV *generally* has the exclusive right to exercise the rights granted to it under this Agreement with respect to the\nProgram, including those in Section 1, within the Licensed Territory. However, the Producer reserves the right to license the Program to third parties in territories not actively exploited by ConvergTV, as determined by the Producer's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement grants ConvergTV exclusive rights within the Licensed Territory for the License Term. The modified version introduces an exception allowing the Producer to license the Program to third parties in territories 'not actively exploited by ConvergTV,' creating ambiguity about what constitutes 'active exploitation' and who determines it. This undermines the exclusivity granted to ConvergTV, potentially leading to disputes.",

As used in this Agreement, force majeure\nshall mean any act of God, fire, flood, war, public disaster, other calamity, strike, or labor difficulties, or any governmental determination,\naction, regulation, or order, or any other occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the non-\nperforming Party, which, despite the non-\nperforming Party’s reasonable efforts, prevents the performance of its obligations hereunder. In the case of a force majeure event, ConvergTV\nwill not be responsible for payment of any revenue share.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that in the event of Force Majeure, ConvergTV will not be responsible for revenue share payments. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by stating ConvergTV 'may' not be responsible and requires 'good-faith negotiations'. This weakens the original clear condition, suggesting that revenue share payment *could* still be required depending on negotiations. It contradicts the definite nature of the first sentence regarding liability.",

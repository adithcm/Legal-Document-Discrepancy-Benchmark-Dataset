Ray, and Brendan Rae, and (b) with respect to Vyera, the actual knowledge (following due inquiry) of Averill L. Powers, Ruchin Patel, Nicholas J. Pelliccione and Anne K. Kirby.",
                "changed_text": "1.66 “Knowledge” means, (a) with respect to CytoDyn, the actual knowledge of Nader Z. Pourhassan, and (b) with respect to Vyera, the actual knowledge of Averill L. Powers. In determining Knowledge, there is no requirement for Due Inquiry.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Knowledge' specified individuals whose 'actual knowledge (following due inquiry)' would be attributed to each party. The modified definition removes the 'following due inquiry' requirement, thus narrowing the scope of what constitutes 'Knowledge'. This creates a contradiction because certain sections of the contract rely on the original definition of 'Knowledge', and the limited scope could affect obligations related to disclosure, representation, and warranties.",

In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Party:\n(a)\nWithout limiting the effect that such termination shall have on any provisions of this Agreement, other than those provisions that this Agreement expressly provides shall survive such termination, all rights and licenses granted herein with respect to the Licensed Product shall terminate, and Vyera shall cease any and all Commercialization activities",

                "explanation": "Section 11.7(a) originally states that upon termination, 'all rights and licenses granted herein with respect to the Licensed Product shall terminate, and Vyera shall cease any and all Commercialization activities'. The changed version creates an in-text contradiction by stating that 'all rights and licenses granted herein with respect to the Licensed Product shall terminate; however, Vyera may continue Commercialization activities'. This contradiction generates uncertainty because it is unclear whether Vyera is actually required to stop Commercialization after termination.",

                "explanation": "The original clause stated that, following the Royalty Term, the licenses become 'non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid and royalty-free.' The changed clause alters 'non-exclusive' to 'exclusive.' This creates a direct contradiction. One version suggests CytoDyn can license the product to others after the Royalty Term, the other implies Vyera retains exclusive rights. This uncertainty affects CytoDyn's ability to generate future revenue and Vyera's competitive advantage.",

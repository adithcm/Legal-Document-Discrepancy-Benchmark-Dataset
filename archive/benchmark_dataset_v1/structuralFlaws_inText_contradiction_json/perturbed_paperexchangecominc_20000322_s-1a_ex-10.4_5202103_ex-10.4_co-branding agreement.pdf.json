                "original_text": "8.1. Automatic Renewal. This Agreement will automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless either party notifies the other at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable, of its intention not to renew this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "8.1. Automatic Renewal. This Agreement may or may not renew at the end of the Initial Term. Renewal is contingent upon PaperExchange's assessment of VerticalNet's performance during the current term. PaperExchange will provide VerticalNet with a non-binding indication of its intention to renew or not renew the agreement 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term. The ultimate decision to renew rests solely with PaperExchange.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement automatically renews unless either party provides a 30-day notice of non-renewal. The changed text introduces uncertainty by stating that renewal is contingent upon PaperExchange's assessment and that the ultimate decision rests solely with PaperExchange. This contradicts the automatic renewal provision and makes the renewal process ambiguous and potentially unfair.",

Subject to Section 13.10 [Survival], upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing party or destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 10 [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.",
                "changed_text": "10.3. Termination. Subject to Section 13.10 [Survival], upon termination of this Agreement, the return or destruction of Confidential Information is optional and at the discretion of the receiving party. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 10 [CONFIDENTIALITY] will typically not survive termination of this Agreement, but may be extended indefinitely at the sole discretion of the disclosing party, given written notice. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 10 [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of no more than three years.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that upon termination, all confidential information will be destroyed or returned to the disclosing party and that the confidentiality will extend for a period of three years. The changed text makes the destruction or return of information an option for the receiving party and states that confidentiality typically won't be maintained but that its duration can be modified, up to a three year limit, as the disclosing party sees fit. These changes undermine the intended protection of confidential information by making it optional and creating ambiguity.",

Except as otherwise set forth herein, neither party shall transfer, assign or cede any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent may be withheld at the other party's reasonable business discretionÍ¾ provided, however, that either party may transfer this Agreement without prior written consent of the other party to an Affiliate or in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of such party.",

PaperExchange shall be allowed to transfer, assign or cede any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other party. VerticalNet may only transfer, assign or cede any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, if it can prove to PaperExchange's satisfaction that this transfer/assignment/delegation is in the interest of PaperExchange and only with the explicit consent of PaperExchange, which may be withheld at the PaperExchange's sole discretion. However, PaperExchange can transfer this Agreement without prior written consent of VerticalNet.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives both parties similar rights to transfer the agreement to an affiliate or in the event of a merger/sale. The modified version creates an imbalance by giving PaperExchange more freedom to assign the contract without consent while making it difficult for VerticalNet by requiring PaperExchange's permission and introducing a subjective 'interest of PaperExchange' test. This contradicts the original equitable distribution of rights and could lead to VerticalNet being unfairly restricted.",

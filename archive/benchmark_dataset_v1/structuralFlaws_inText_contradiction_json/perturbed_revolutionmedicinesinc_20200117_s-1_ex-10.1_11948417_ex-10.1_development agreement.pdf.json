                "original_text": "1.17 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means: (a) with respect to Sanofi, [***], consistent with [***] that [***], taking into account [***], including [***] and (b) with respect to RevMed, [***], consistent with [***] that [***], taking into account [***], including [***].",
                "changed_text": "1.17 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means: (a) with respect to Sanofi, efforts that are purely discretionary, and Sanofi is not required to take any action if it deems it not commercially beneficial. (b) with respect to RevMed, [***], consistent with [***] that [***], taking into account [***], including [***].",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" implies a standard of effort. The modified definition states that Sanofi's efforts are purely discretionary, which contradicts the implied obligation in other sections requiring them to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts. This introduces uncertainty because it suggests Sanofi might not have to make significant efforts at all, even when the contract requires them to.",

                "explanation": "The original text specified that Sanofi's license is exclusive and even RevMed is barred from utilizing the license. In this case, the modified version removes the exclusivity for Sanofi. This creates an in-text contradiction since the contract no longer specifies whether it is exclusive and could potentially create confusion on whether RevMed can utilize the license.",

Upon expiration of this Agreement, the licenses granted to Sanofi under Section 3.1 will revert back to RevMed and will no longer be licensed to Sanofi.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that upon expiration of the agreement, the license granted to Sanofi would become perpetual, royalty free, and irrevocable. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that the license would revert back to RevMed. This contradiction creates significant uncertainty about Sanofi's rights after the contract expires and whether Sanofi can continue to commercialize the products.",

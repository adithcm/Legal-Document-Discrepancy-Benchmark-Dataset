                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "“Territory” means the countries and/or territories listed in Schedule 1.",
                "changed_text": "“Territory” means the countries and/or territories listed in Schedule 1, unless otherwise agreed to by Supplier in writing. Supplier retains the right to modify the Territory at any time during the term of the agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear definition of the 'Territory' as listed in Schedule 1. The changed text introduces ambiguity by stating that the territory can be modified by the Supplier at any time, creating a contradiction and uncertainty regarding the Reseller's rights within the defined territory.",

                "changed_text": "Thereafter, this Agreement may be renewed for successive 1-year terms (each a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”), subject to the Supplier's discretion and a review of Reseller performance. Renewal is not guaranteed and is contingent upon meeting performance metrics defined by the Supplier.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement automatically renews, implying a guaranteed extension. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that renewal is 'subject to the Supplier's discretion,' thus contradicting the 'automatic renewal' clause. This change creates ambiguity about the agreement's duration and the Reseller's long-term prospects.",

                "original_text": "Supplier shall be fully responsible for shipping the Products to the Reseller at the address of the Reseller specified in each Order (or as otherwise communicated by Reseller to Supplier under this Agreement) and will obtain and provide for itself and/or on behalf of Reseller, any and all registrations, licenses, permits, certificates and all other documentation and information required for the exportation, importation, storage, marketing and otherwise resale of the Products in the Territory. For such process, Supplier will allocate the additional cost on a pre-agreed per Product unit additional price basis, which will be subject to an increase (subject to changes in taxes).",
                "changed_text": "Supplier shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist with shipping the Products to the Reseller, but Reseller is ultimately responsible for all aspects of shipping and all costs associated with shipping the Products to the Reseller at the address of the Reseller specified in each Order (or as otherwise communicated by Reseller to Supplier under this Agreement). Reseller is responsible to obtain and provide any and all registrations, licenses, permits, certificates and all other documentation and information required for the exportation, importation, storage, marketing and otherwise resale of the Products in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the Supplier's full responsibility for shipping and obtaining necessary documentation. The modified text shifts the responsibility to the Reseller, contradicting the initial statement. This creates a significant uncertainty about which party bears the costs and obligations related to logistics and regulatory compliance, impacting the Reseller's profitability and operational burden.",

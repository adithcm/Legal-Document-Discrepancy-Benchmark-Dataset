                "original_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to, and Customer shall not use the Software in excess of, a single hardware chassis or card or that number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s), as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order which has been accepted by Cisco and for which Customer has paid to Cisco the required license fee.",
                "changed_text": "Customer's license to use the Software may extend beyond a single hardware chassis or card and number of agents or users as set forth in the Purchase Order. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing by Cisco, the customer is permitted to utilize the software to its fullest potential, and any restrictions outlined in any documentation may be subject to change at Cisco's discretion. The determination of whether the customer has paid all required license fees is to be determined solely by Cisco.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets clear limitations on software usage based on the purchase order. The modified text introduces ambiguity by suggesting these limits might not always apply, are subject to change, and ultimately decided by Cisco. This directly contradicts the original, creating uncertainty about the extent of permitted software use and whether the customer is in breach of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement and the license granted herein shall remain effective until terminated. Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement and the license granted herein shall remain effective until terminated; however, Cisco reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, and at its sole discretion, with or without notice to the customer. Customer may only terminate this agreement with the express written consent of Cisco. Customer's rights under this agreement may be suspended or revoked at any time if Cisco deems necessary. Upon any termination, Customer will promptly return all copies of the Software and Documentation, as well as any related materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows the customer to terminate at any time by destroying the software, while Cisco can only terminate if the customer breaches the agreement. The modified version gives Cisco the unilateral right to terminate at any time for any reason, while severely restricting the customer's ability to terminate, creating a significant imbalance and direct contradiction. Furthermore, the switch from destroying software copies to returning them creates more confusion about how the process should go.",

                "original_text": "Cisco warrants that commencing from the date of shipment to Customer (but in case of resale by an authorized Cisco reseller, commencing not more than ninety (90) days after original shipment by Cisco), and continuing for a period of the longer of (a) ninety (90) days or (b) the software warranty period (if any) set forth in the warranty card accompanying the Product (if any): (a) the media on which the Software is furnished will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use; and (b) the Software substantially conforms to its published specifications. The date of shipment of a Product by Cisco is set forth on the packaging material in which the Product is shipped. Except for the foregoing, the Software is provided AS IS. This limited warranty extends only to the Customer who is the original licensee. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of Cisco and its suppliers and licensors under this limited warranty will be, at Cisco's option, repair, replacement, or refund of the Software if reported (or, upon request, returned) to Cisco or the party supplying the Software to Customer, if different than Cisco.",
                "changed_text": "Cisco provides no warranties, express or implied, regarding the Software. All software is provided “AS IS,” with all faults, and Cisco explicitly disclaims any warranty. Any prior documentation, statements, or agreements to the contrary are superseded and have no effect. However, in cases of Cisco negligence, the company may elect at its own discretion to offer a replacement, repair, or refund. These options are not considered remedies. This disclaimer holds even if other documentation or personnel claim a warranty exists. Any limited warranties mentioned earlier in this document may be voided at the discretion of Cisco.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines a limited warranty. The modified text completely disclaims any warranty, creating a direct contradiction. Adding, “Any limited warranties mentioned earlier in this document may be voided at the discretion of Cisco,” serves to drive the point home that the customer cannot rely on any warranty protection, and creates further uncertainty regarding any rights the customer has regarding defects. This increases risk and makes enforcement difficult.",

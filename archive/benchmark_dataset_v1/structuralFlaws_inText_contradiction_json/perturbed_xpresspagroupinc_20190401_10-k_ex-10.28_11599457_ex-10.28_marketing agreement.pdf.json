Unless this Agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of Section ​12, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until July 31, 2019 (the “Initial Term”). Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms of six (6) months (each a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) unless written notice is given by either Party no later than thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term.",

The modified text changes this, making the renewal conditional upon written consent from both parties. This creates a contradiction, as one implies automatic renewal, the other requires explicit agreement.",

Calm or its authorized designees shall be the sole suppliers to XSPA of XSPA’s requirements for Products, Gifts, Shopping Bags, Uniforms and Inserts (collectively, “Product Collateral”) for each Store throughout the Territory.

In the event that inventory of any Product Collateral in any Store falls below fifty percent (50%) of the initial amount of such Product Collateral provided to such Store, XSPA shall use best efforts to advise Calm in sufficient detail to enable Calm to ship additional inventory of such Product Collateral to such Store. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as between the Parties, Calm shall retain legal title to any and all Product Collateral (other than Uniforms) until sold in a Store in the Territory or otherwise disbursed in a Store in the Territory (in the case of Gifts, Inserts and Shopping Bags) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event Calm identifies any issue with any Product Collateral making it unsuitable for use as contemplated by this Agreement or issues a recall with respect to any Product, XSPA shall promptly return any and all affected Product Collateral to Calm or its authorized designees upon receiving notice of such issue or recall.",

The modified text changes this to 'Calm or its authorized designees may, at its discretion, be suppliers'. This introduces uncertainty as to whether Calm is obligated to be the sole supplier. Moreover, original text states that Calm shall retain title for all products collateral, the modified text transfers the rights to XSPA which is a direct conflict",

                "original_text": "5.1 Allied grants Newegg a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-transferable, and non- sublicensable worldwide license to use, publicly display, transmit, broadcast, stream, distribute and reproduce the Allied Marks in all approved forms and in manners for the purposes of this Agreement during the Term. Allied acknowledges and agrees that Newegg shall not pay any fees or royalties for the license of the Allied Marks, except the Sponsorship Fee specified in Schedule 3.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Allied grants Newegg a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-transferable, and non- sublicensable worldwide license to use, publicly display, transmit, broadcast, stream, distribute and reproduce the Allied Marks in all approved forms and in manners for the purposes of this Agreement during the Term. Allied acknowledges and agrees that Newegg may be required to pay additional royalties or fees for the license of the Allied Marks, as determined by Allied at its sole discretion. These additional fees will be outlined in subsequent amendments to this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Newegg pays no fees except the sponsorship fee. The modified text introduces the possibility of additional, undefined royalties, contradicting the explicit statement in the original clause and creating uncertainty about Newegg's financial obligations.",

                "changed_text": "7.1 In all of Allied’s actions and publications (in all media and formats) in connection with the marketing and conducting of the Events, Allied may, at its sole discretion, mention Newegg as one of several sponsors of the Arena. The level of prominence given to Newegg’s sponsorship is solely at Allied’s discretion and may vary.",
                "explanation": "The original text obligates Allied to communicate Newegg's *exclusive* sponsorship. The changed text makes any mention of Newegg discretionary and removes the exclusivity, creating a contradiction about the level of sponsorship promotion Newegg is entitled to and uncertainty over Allied's obligations.",

Further, if Sponsorship Fees have been paid in advance, the Sponsorship Fee shall be prorated through the date of termination and Allied shall refund the portion corresponding to the unused period of the Term.",
                "changed_text": "14.6 Upon termination for any reason, Newegg may be required to pay all remaining Sponsorship Fees, regardless of whether the corresponding Sponsorship Benefits have been fully delivered. The determination of whether Sponsorship Fees must still be paid is at Allied's sole discretion and will be based on factors including, but not limited to, the reason for termination and the length of the Term completed. Any advanced payments will be subject to Allied's discretion on refunds, and there will be no proration.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Newegg is discharged of future payment obligations upon termination and is entitled to a prorated refund for advance payments. The changed text directly contradicts this by stating Newegg *may* be required to pay all remaining fees, and refund is at Allied's discretion, thus creating uncertainty about Newegg's financial liability upon termination.",

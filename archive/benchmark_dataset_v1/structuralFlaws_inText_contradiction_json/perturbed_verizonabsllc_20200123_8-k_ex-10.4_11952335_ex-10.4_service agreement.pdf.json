The Servicer will manage, service, administer and collect on the Receivables with reasonable care using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises for all comparable device payment plan agreement receivables that it services for itself or others according to the Servicing Procedures.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3.2 Servicing of Receivables.\n(a) General Servicing Obligations. The Servicer will manage, service, administer and collect on the Receivables; however, the level of care and skill may vary depending on the Servicer's current business priorities and resource availability. The Servicer is not obligated to adhere strictly to the Servicing Procedures.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates \"reasonable care\" and adherence to \"Servicing Procedures.\" The modified text introduces contradiction by stating the service level \"may vary\" and the Servicer isn't strictly bound by procedures. This weakens enforcement by creating ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits resignation unless legally unable to perform. The changed text allows for resignation with notice, creating a direct contradiction that makes enforcement of the service agreement uncertain. Now it is up for the company to replace the servicer or not.",

Each of the Servicer and the Marketing Agent, severally and not jointly, will be liable under this Agreement only for its specific obligations under this Agreement. All other liability is expressly waived and released as a condition of, and consideration for, the execution of this Agreement by the Servicer or the Marketing Agent, as applicable. Each of the Servicer and the Marketing Agent, severally and not jointly, will be liable only for its own willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in performing its obligations under this Agreement.",

While each of the Servicer and Marketing Agent will generally only be liable for its specific obligations, the Issuer retains the right to pursue broader claims if deemed necessary to protect Noteholder interests. The standard for liability will be commercially reasonable practices, unless otherwise required by law.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits liability to specific obligations and willful misconduct/gross negligence. The modified text introduces a contradiction by allowing the Issuer to pursue \"broader claims\" and applying a \"commercially reasonable practices\" standard. This could lead to legal disputes because those standards are ambigious. ",

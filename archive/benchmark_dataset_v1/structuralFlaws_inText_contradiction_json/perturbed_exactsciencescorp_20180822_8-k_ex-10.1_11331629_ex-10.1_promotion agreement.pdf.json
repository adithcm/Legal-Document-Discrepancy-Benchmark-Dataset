Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, Pfizer shall have significant rights with respect to the Product, and can Promote, Market or otherwise commercialize the Product beyond what is expressly authorized under this Agreement.

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Pfizer has 'no other rights' beyond what is expressly authorized, and that Exact 'retains all rights' not explicitly granted. The modified text introduces uncertainty by suggesting that Pfizer has 'significant rights' beyond what is expressly authorized and that Exact retains 'some rights.' This creates a contradiction regarding the scope of Pfizer's rights and Exact's retained ownership, potentially leading to disputes over commercialization activities.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses definitive language ('it will immediately remove,' 'it will promptly remove,' 'it will not knowingly make') imposing strict obligations on the parties. The modified version introduces ambiguity and weakens these obligations by using phrases like 'use reasonable efforts,' 'may remove,' and 'attempt to not knowingly make.' This creates a conflict because the original implies mandatory action, while the modified version suggests discretion or possibility, making enforcement uncertain. For instance, it's unclear if a party's failure to remove a debarred representative constitutes a breach if they only used 'reasonable efforts'.",

                "explanation": "In the original agreement, it clearly states that any assignment requires written consent from the other party, except in specific cases. To cause internal conflict, the changed text uses the word 'may' instead of 'may not', it changes the assignees and type of transactions, introduces an action that is 'valid until further action', states that assignees don't assume all obligations of the assignor and that the agreement is 'not binding upon' the respective successors, causing the contract to have conflicting stipulations and difficult enforcement of the initial provisions.",

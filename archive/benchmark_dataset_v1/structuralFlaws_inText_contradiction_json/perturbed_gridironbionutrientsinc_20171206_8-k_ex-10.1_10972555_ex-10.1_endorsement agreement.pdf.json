                "original_text": "“Contract Period” shall mean that period of time of three (3) years commencing on November 1st, 2017 and concluding November 2nd, 2020, unless terminated sooner or extended as provided in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "“Contract Period” shall mean that period of time of three (3) years commencing on November 1st, 2017 and concluding November 2nd, 2020. The contract period may be shorter than 3 years, depending on NFLA's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Contract Period' specifies a fixed duration. The added sentence introduces ambiguity, stating the term can be shorter, which directly contradicts the originally defined 3-year duration. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual length of the agreement.",

Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter beginning\non the first full quarter [three (3) month period] of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for the term of\nthis Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "A *donation, potentially up to $0.05 per Unit sold of Licensed Products within the Contract Territory, may be payable to the **NFL Alumni Northern California Chapter. Donated amounts might be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter beginning on the first full quarter [three (3) month period] of the Agreement and potentially continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for a period determined at the Company’s sole discretion. The amount and frequency of donations are subject to change based on the Company's financial performance.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a $0.05 donation per unit sold. The modified text introduces uncertainty by using phrases like 'potentially up to' and 'might be allocated'. It further empowers the company to alter the amount, timing and frequency based on financial factors, which contradicts the original obligation. This creates ambiguity regarding the company's donation commitment.",

However, afterward, the Company may attempt to obtain ownership of any trademark or trade name within the Contract Territory, contingent upon written approval from NFLA. If such written approval is granted, the Company can freely manage these trademarks without further constraints from NFLA.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the contract prevents the company from acquiring trademarks related to NFLA branding both during and after the Contract Period. The modified version now allows the company to pursue trademark ownership post-contract, pending NFLA approval, which directly contradicts the original restriction. It shifts control to the Company upon written approval, creating ambiguity in trademark ownership.",

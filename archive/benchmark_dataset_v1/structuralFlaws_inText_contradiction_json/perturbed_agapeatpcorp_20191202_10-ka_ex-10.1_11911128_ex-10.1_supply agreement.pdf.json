                "original_text": "1.2\nTerm\nThis agreement is for a term of ten (10) years.\n1.3\nRenewal\nThis agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of every ten (10) year term, with each subsequent term of renewal being for a ten\n(10) year term. A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than\nbreach of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.2\nTerm\nThis agreement is for a term of ten (10) years.\n1.3\nRenewal\nThis agreement may be renewed at the end of the initial ten (10) year term, but renewal is not guaranteed. A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than breach of this agreement. Any renewal term shall be subject to the Manufacturer's sole discretion, irrespective of prior performance.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic renewal, creating a firm expectation. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that renewal is 'not guaranteed' and subject to the Manufacturer's 'sole discretion,' directly contradicting the original automatic renewal clause. This creates uncertainty about the contract's duration and enforceability beyond the initial term.",

The Manufacturer indemnifies the Customer for the same.",
                "changed_text": "3.5\nIntellectual Property\n3.5 (a)\nThe Manufacturer covenants that the Products are clear of any Intellectual Property claims known to the Manufacturer by third parties and that the Customer has rights to sell and market the Products in the listed territories (Schedule C). The Manufacturer's indemnity is limited to direct claims related to existing, known IP disputes.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a broad covenant that the Products are free of ANY IP claims and grants worldwide sales rights. The modified text significantly weakens this by limiting the covenant to only KNOWN IP claims and restricting the sales rights to only the territories in Schedule C. The limitation on the indemnity further reduces the Manufacturer's liability, conflicting with the original, more expansive assurance of IP rights.",

                "changed_text": "13.2\nThe Manufacturer grants exclusive rights to the Customer for the term of ten (10) years from the date of the signing of this agreement and may consider extending the exclusive rights beyond the initial term if the Customer continues to show promise and innovation in the market. The manufacturer reserves the right to revoke the exclusive rights beyond the initial ten-year term if it is not in the company's best interest.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly grants exclusive rights for an indefinite period upon fulfilling the minimum annual purchase requirement. The revised version introduces uncertainty by making any extension of exclusive rights after the initial term contingent on the manufacturer's subjective assessment ('show promise and innovation') and allowing revocation if it's not in their 'best interest.' This directly contradicts the original promise of indefinite exclusivity upon meeting the purchase requirements.",

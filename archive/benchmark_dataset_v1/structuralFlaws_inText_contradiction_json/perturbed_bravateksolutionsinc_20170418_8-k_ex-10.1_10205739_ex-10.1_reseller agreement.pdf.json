                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Contract is renewable for 1 year extension by amendment to this agreement. Either Party may terminate this agreement for non-cause with a sixty (60) written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Contract is renewable indefinitely, without any requirement for amendment to this agreement. Either Party may terminate this agreement for non-cause with a thirty (30) day written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the contract is renewable for a 1-year extension by amendment, requiring mutual agreement to extend the term. The modified text states that the contract is renewable indefinitely, removing the need for an amendment and suggesting automatic renewal. This contradicts the implicit need for both parties to agree to the renewal by signing an amendment. Additionally, the notice period for termination is reduced from 60 days to 30 days, conflicting with the original terms.",

                "changed_text": "Referral Fees will be paid within ninety (90) days, subject to Company's sole discretion, of the collection of receivables from the Registered Referral.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original payment terms by extending the payment timeline from 30 days to 90 days and adding a 'sole discretion' clause, introducing uncertainty about when Referral Fees are to be paid, creating a conflict with the original definite payment timeline.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the Term hereof and for a period of six (6) months following the termination of this Agreement or the discontinuation of any of the Company Products, (i) the Reseller shall have the exclusive right to commission for any Registered Referrals",
                "changed_text": "During the Term hereof, the Reseller may or may not have the exclusive right to commission for any Registered Referrals, based on the company's evaluation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause guarantees an exclusive right to commission for Registered Referrals during the term and for six months after termination. By changing this to 'may or may not' depending on the company's evaluation, the exclusivity is removed. This directly contradicts the original assurance, creating uncertainty about the reseller's compensation and rights.",

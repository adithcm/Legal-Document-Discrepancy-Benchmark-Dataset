                "explanation": "The original text requires advance approval for advertising. The modified text states that Bizzingo may use the property without advance approval from Theismann, directly contradicting the initial clause. The edited clause introduces a contradiction regarding the approval process for promotional materials, creating ambiguity regarding Bizzingo's obligations and Theismann's rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the term is for one year, and can be extended *only* by written addendum. The modified text introduces automatic renewal unless notice is given, which contradicts the requirement for a written addendum to extend the term. This creates confusion on how to extend, if both methods are valid or not.",

                "explanation": "Section 11(d) originally grants Theismann the unconditional right to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice. The modified text completely removes this right. This creates a direct contradiction, as Theismann is initially given an explicit right to terminate without cause, but then that right is denied.  This would lead to disputes over whether Theismann can terminate the contract at will.",

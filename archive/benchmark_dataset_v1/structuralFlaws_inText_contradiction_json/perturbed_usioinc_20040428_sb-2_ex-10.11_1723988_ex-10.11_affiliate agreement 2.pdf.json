The  term  (\"Term\")  of  this Agreement shall be for one hundred eighty  days  (180)  from  the  date set forth below unless Network 1 or Visa or MasterCard  or Harris Bank doesn't approve Affiliate's ISO application, in which case,  the  Term  will  be  3 years. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive  one-year  terms  unless  terminated by either party by providing the other  with  30  days  written notice that this Agreement will not be renewed or Affiliate  enters  into  a  Processing  agreement  with  Network  1  and  an ISO Sponsorship  agreement  with  Harris  Bank  in  which  case  this Agreement will automatically  terminate  concurrent  with  the  execution  of  such agreements.",

The  term  (\"Term\")  of  this Agreement shall be for one hundred eighty  days  (180)  from  the  date set forth below unless Network 1 or Visa or MasterCard  or Harris Bank doesn't approve Affiliate's ISO application, in which case,  the  Term  will  be  3 years. This Agreement may renew for successive one-year terms at Network 1's sole discretion, without requiring notice to Affiliate. Affiliate entering into a Processing agreement with Network 1 and an ISO Sponsorship agreement with Harris Bank will not automatically terminate this agreement and will only terminate if both parties agree in writing.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces contradictions regarding the term and renewal of the agreement. The original text states automatic renewal with 30-day notice for termination and automatic termination upon Affiliate entering another Processing agreement. The modification states renewal is at Network 1's sole discretion without notice, directly conflicting with the automatic renewal clause. Furthermore, the amendment says that even when entering into a Processing agreement with Network 1 and an ISO Sponsorship, it may not terminate the agreement and will only terminate if both parties agree in writing, directly conflicting with original text that states the Processing agreement automatically terminates the initial agreement.",

The  surplus  funding  amount after costs noted in Exhibit A based on all Merchant  applications  obtained  for  Equipment  and Products sold or leased by Affiliate  or  Contractors  located  by  Affiliate  pursuant  to  Section  1.01  [CONTRACTORS]. Affiliate  shall  receive the buy rate with revenue share as noted in Exhibit A. B.     Affiliate  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  all merchants and subscribing businesses  referred  by  Affiliate are a party to a contract with Network 1 and it's Member bank and that Network 1 and the Member bank has a direct contractual relationship  with  the  merchants  and  subscribing  businesses.

Network  1 may, at its sole discretion, determine whether Affiliate has rights to residual revenue.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states how the affiliate's fee will be calculated using a clearly defined amount after costs and states the Affiliate will receive the buy rate with revenue share as noted in Exhibit A. The new clause states Network 1 may elect to pay Affiliate with a new model to be defined later. Similarly, it changes \"Affiliate shall receive the buy rate\" to \"Affiliate may receive a buy rate\". The original clauses defines residual revenue rights for the affiliate. The new clause states that Network 1 may, at its sole discretion, determine whether Affiliate has rights to residual revenue. This creates uncertainty regarding the affiliate's compensation and whether they will receive residuals.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that Contractors located by Affiliate shall remain Contractors of Network 1 if the agreement is terminated for any reason. The modified version uses \"may or may not remain\", which directly contradicts the original guarantee of contractor retention. The new clause introduces uncertainty as to the fate of the contractors in the event of termination, potentially disrupting the affiliate's expectations regarding their downline.",

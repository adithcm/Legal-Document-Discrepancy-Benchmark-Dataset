                "changed_text": "2.1 Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period of 2 years after the Effective Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any Person, which will include being a principal, agent, shareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever, carry on or be engaged in Mining Activities in the Area of Non-Competition; however, Western Copper may engage in such activities if Western Copper gets the written permission from Glamis which will not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits Western Copper from engaging in mining activities in the Area of Non-Competition. The added clause introduces an exception, stating that Western Copper may engage in such activities with Glamis's written permission (not unreasonably withheld). This creates a contradiction, as it's now unclear whether the non-competition is absolute or conditional, leading to uncertainty about enforcement.",

                "original_text": "3.1 Western Copper acknowledges and agrees that a breach of its covenants contained in this Agreement would result in damage to Glamis that could not adequately be compensated for by monetary award alone, Accordingly, Western Copper agrees that in the event of any such breach, in addition to any other remedies available to Glamis at law or otherwise, Glamis will be entitled, as a matter of right and without the need to prove damage, to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for relief by way of injunction, restraining order, decree or otherwise as may be appropriate to ensure compliance by Western Copper with the provisions of this Agreement and to restrain any breach of this Agreement by Western Copper. Any remedy expressly set forth in this ยง3.1 wall be in addition to and not inclusive of or dependent upon the exercise of any other remedy available to Glamis at law or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 Western Copper acknowledges and agrees that a breach of its covenants contained in this Agreement would result in damage to Glamis that could not adequately be compensated for by monetary award alone, Accordingly, Western Copper agrees that in the event of any such breach, in addition to any other remedies available to Glamis at law or otherwise, Glamis will be entitled to seek monetary damages only as a remedy. Any remedy expressly set forth in this ยง3.1 will be limited to monetary damages and not inclusive of any other remedy available to Glamis at law or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides Glamis with multiple remedies in case of a breach, including injunctions and other equitable relief, in addition to monetary damages. The modified text restricts Glamis's remedies solely to monetary damages. This directly contradicts the original broader scope of remedies, making it unclear whether Glamis can seek non-monetary relief, leading to uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement is binding upon successors and assigns. However, the added text restricts assignment or transfer unless written consent from Glamis is obtained and Glamis may arbitrarily withhold consent. Therefore, adding an exception to the rule that the agreement can be assigned or transferred to the respective successors creates an in-text contradiction.",

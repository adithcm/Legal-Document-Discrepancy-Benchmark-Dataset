                "explanation": "The original text states that changes to the terms are subject to acceptance by the affiliate and software publisher if no objection is received within 14 days. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating that element 5 can implement changes even if an objection is received, undermining the original clause regarding the affiliate's right to object and the changes being subject to acceptance. This creates uncertainty and favors element 5's ability to unilaterally alter the agreement.",

The reason for cancellation must be provided and will be subject to review by element 5.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows either party to cancel the agreement at any time, with or without reason. The modified text contradicts this by adding a condition where element 5 can deny termination if it deems it necessary and the affiliates have not completed 1000 sales. Additionally, the introduction of reason subject to review introduces an element of discretion for element 5 and contradicts the initial statement of either party canceling 'with or without' providing a reason.",

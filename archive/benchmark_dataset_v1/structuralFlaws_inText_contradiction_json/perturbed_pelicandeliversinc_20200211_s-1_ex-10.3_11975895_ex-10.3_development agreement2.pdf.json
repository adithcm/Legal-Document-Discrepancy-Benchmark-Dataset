                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise provided herein, this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of one year, automatically renewing for subsequent one-year terms unless terminated by either party with 30 days written notice prior to the renewal date. This agreement is automatically renewed regardless of project completion, unless written notice is provided.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the agreement continues until completion or termination of the project as mutually agreed. The modification states the agreement automatically renews annually unless terminated, regardless of project completion, creating a contradiction about the term and renewal process.",

In the event of a termination or expiration of this Agreement or any SOW for any reason, developer will, as requested by and at additional cost to Client, provide up to three (3) months of Fee billable assistance (collectively, the Termination Assistance Services) in transitioning from Developer to an alternative software service provider including, without limitation, the following:\n(a) knowledge transfer regarding the operation, use, and support of the subject Program; return of all documentation containing Content, Marks,\nProcedures a d Confidential Information in a format reasonably specified by Client and assistance with data migration to an alternative solution;\nand (c) any related additional services as requested by Client. Developer shall provide Termination Assistance Services to Client in a manner that\ndoes not interfere with, interrupt or degrade the Subject Program. The term of this Agreement or applicable SOW shall not be deemed to have\nexpired or terminated until the Termination Assistance Services are completed.",

In the event of a termination or expiration of this Agreement or any SOW for any reason, developer will, at its sole discretion, provide up to three (3) months of assistance in transitioning from Developer to an alternative software service provider. The cost and specifics of this assistance will be determined by Developer at the time of termination. Developer is under no obligation to provide any specific services, and the term of assistance is subject to Developer's availability and internal resource allocation.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that upon termination, the client is entitled to a refund of non-accrued prepaid fees, while the developer *will* provide termination assistance services at a fee. The modification states that the client is *not* entitled to a refund, and it is up to the developer's discretion when providing assistance, and the specific scope and cost is not fixed. This creates an inconsistency regarding what is provided during termination.",

Accordingly, Client will be the copyright author and owner of all of the Works. To the extent permissible, Developer hereby assigns and\ntransfers to Client all copyright and other intellectual property ownership in the Works. Developer agrees to assist Client, as well as execute any\ndocuments reasonably necessary, to perfect the assignment of such rights to Client. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the payment of Fees\nand a Bonus (if any), as referenced in Section 5 of this Agreement, shall be the full consideration to Developer for the assignment of rights herein.\nUpon payment in full of all obligations hereunder, Developer unconditionally and irrevocably grants to Client all software, improvements, code and\nother work produce produced by the Developer during the course of this agreement.

Client and Developer will have the right to sublicense or transfer the intellectual property to a third party, upon mutual agreement. Should either party decide to commercially market any aspect of the software, both parties agree to share any revenue generated from the commercial marketing based upon percentages previously agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "Original text assigns all ownership to the client as 'work made for hire.' Modified text redefines the works as jointly owned by both the client and developer, contradicting the prior clause. Revenue sharing and sublicensing rights are now subject to mutual agreement, again contradicting the exclusivity of the client as owner.",

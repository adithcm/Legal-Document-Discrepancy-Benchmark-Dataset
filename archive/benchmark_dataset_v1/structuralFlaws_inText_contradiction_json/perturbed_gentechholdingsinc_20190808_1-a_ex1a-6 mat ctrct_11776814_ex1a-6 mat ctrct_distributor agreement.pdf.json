                "original_text": "Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce, and upon confirmed the first order, this client come to be exclusive of Distributor, every new customer introduced by Distributor, must be approved by the company prior to any sale. After official approval from the Company, the customer introduced by Distributor, will appear on an official list in this contract, and will only be met by the Distributor and will follow the rules of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce, and upon confirmed the first order, this client come to be exclusive of Distributor. The company retains the right to directly engage with clients introduced by the distributor. The company is not obligated to approve every new customer introduced by Distributor prior to any sale. Customers introduced by the Distributor will not automatically appear on an official list in this contract, and may be met by parties other than the Distributor, subject to the company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text guarantees exclusivity for clients introduced by the distributor after the first confirmed order. The modification removes this guarantee, stating the company may directly engage with those clients and doesn't always need to approve new ones. The exclusivity of the distributor is therefore weakened. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the distributor's exclusive rights, making enforcement difficult.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Distributor Agreement, Company hereby appoints and grants Distributor the exclusive right to sell and distribute the Products to customers that Distributor introduce and confirmed by Company, (in all territory of United State of America (USA) and to render other services as a distributor for Company as set forth herein. Distributor shall limit its activities with respect to the Products to Customers located within the Territory and refrain from selling or otherwise transferring, directly or indirectly, the Products to any person outside the Territory, without the express written consent of Company. Company shall not sell or otherwise supply, directly or indirectly, the Products to any Distributor’s Customer’s, except by sale through the Distributor. The Company shall not contact any of Distributor’s Customer’s for any reason, without the prior written approval of Distributor.",

                "explanation": "This section originally states the company will not sell to the distributor's customers except through the distributor, and cannot contact them without approval. The modified text explicitly allows the company to sell directly to those customers and contact them without needing the distributor's approval. This directly contradicts the exclusive appointment previously granted, causing confusion over sales and customer ownership.",

For the avoidance of doubt, the customer and sub-distributor lists of Distributor shall be deemed to constitute Proprietary Information under this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(g) The obligations of the Recipient Party under this Section 6 shall not survive termination or nonrenewal of this Agreement. Any information, including customer lists, will not be considered proprietary information.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text. Initially, the clause clearly stated that confidentiality obligations survived termination for three years, and explicitly included customer lists as proprietary information. The modified version states that confidentiality obligations *do not* survive termination and denies that customer lists are proprietary. This introduces conflict and uncertainty, as it becomes unclear if the distributor must protect confidential information after the agreement ends and whether customer lists are protected.",

The Parties acknowledge that through the course of a history of integrated operations SpinCo and the members of the\nSpinCo Group have each obtained knowledge of and access to, or otherwise used, certain Honeywell IP, including Patents, Trade Secrets, copyrighted\ncontent, proprietary know-how, and other Intellectual Property Rights that are not otherwise governed expressly by the Separation Agreement or the\nAncillary Agreements or identified expressly in the schedules thereto (collectively, “Honeywell Shared IP”). With regard\nto the Honeywell Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that SpinCo has the freedom to use such Honeywell Shared IP in the future. Hence, as of the\nDistribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the\nSpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for “have-made” purposes),\nworldwide license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any\nother Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution\nDate and the natural growth and development thereof.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants SpinCo a perpetual license to Honeywell Shared IP. The modified version introduces several contradictions. First, it makes the use of Honeywell Shared IP subject to Honeywell's sole discretion, contradicting the original grant of freedom to use. Second, it changes the 'hereby grants' to 'may grant', making the granting of the license uncertain. Third, it limits the license to five years, conflicting with the 'perpetual' term initially granted. This creates uncertainty about the duration and enforceability of the license.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants Honeywell a perpetual license to SpinCo Shared IP. The modification introduces a contradiction by stating that Honeywell has the freedom to use the SpinCo Shared IP, but then adds a clause that SpinCo can revoke the license with 90 days written notice. This contradicts the 'perpetual' nature of the license initially granted and creates uncertainty as to whether Honeywell truly has the freedom to use the IP perpetually.",

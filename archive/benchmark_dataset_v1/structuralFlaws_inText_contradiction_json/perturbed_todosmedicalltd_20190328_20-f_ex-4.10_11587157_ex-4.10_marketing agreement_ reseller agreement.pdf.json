The Reseller shall have a right of first refusal to include within this Agreement any additional products developed, manufactured, or sold by the Company following the Effective Date that are not currently included in Exhibit A, and upon the exercise of such right, the term “Products” shall be expanded to mean such additional products as well. For purposes of clarity, the parties agree that upon Todos’s development of a blood screening test for colon cancer, such product shall be added to this Agreement and included within the definition of “Products”, subject to the Reseller and Todos agreeing on the commercial terms for such product, including the price.",

Todos reserves the right to directly sell the Products in the Territory without providing notice to Reseller.

                "explanation": "The original text grants the Reseller an \"exclusive right\" to distribute and sell the Products. The changed text removes the exclusivity by stating \"Todos reserves the right to directly sell the Products in the Territory without providing notice to Reseller.\", creating a contradiction about the exclusivity of the distribution rights.",

The Reseller shall be entitled to purchase the Products from Todos for resale to Customers at a price determined solely by Todos, with or without prior notice to Reseller. Todos reserves the right to change the product price at its sole discretion at any point during the agreement. At the end of each year this Agreement is in effect, the Parties will discuss each party’s costs and whether to revise the Product Price. Todos shall provide the Reseller with Products for clinical trials at a cost to be determined by Todos.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the product price will be between a certain range and agreed upon by both parties. The changed text contradicts this by granting Todos the sole discretion to determine and change the price, creating uncertainty and a contradiction in how the product price is determined. The clause \"Todos shall provide the Reseller with Products for clinical trials at a cost to be determined by Todos.\" creates a contradiction as initially stating it would be at no charge.",

Upon completion of the Initial Term, provided that the Reseller has achieved the Annual Milestones, the term of the Agreement shall be automatically renewed for an additional five (5) years.

                "explanation": "The original text states that renewal is automatic after the initial term if the Reseller meets the annual milestones. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating renewal is at \"Todos' sole discretion\", regardless of the milestones, making the renewal contingent on Todos' decision rather than the Reseller's performance and the prior agreement. The last sentence previously stated that the Agreement will renew unless notice is given, while the modified version says that the Agreement may be renewed if Todos decides to renew.",

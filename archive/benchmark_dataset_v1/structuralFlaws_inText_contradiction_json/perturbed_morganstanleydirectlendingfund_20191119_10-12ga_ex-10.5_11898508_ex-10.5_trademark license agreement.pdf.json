                "original_text": "Section 4.1. Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues in perpetuity, unless termination occurs pursuant to Sections 4.2 through 4.4.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.1. Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for a period of one year, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms, unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. This is superseded by sections 4.2 through 4.4 which are the only circumstances that will terminate this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Section 4.1 originally stated the agreement continues in perpetuity. The modified version introduces a one-year term with automatic renewal, contradicting the original 'in perpetuity' clause. The added sentence at the end makes the original agreement even more confusing.",

Prior to using the Brand in any material new manner that deviates substantially from past practices, Licensee shall submit such proposed uses to Licensor for prior approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld. However, Licensor may not require approval for uses of the brand under $1 million, and Licensee will retain full control over these uses.",
                "explanation": "The original section stated that the Licensee needs approval for the Brand in ANY manner. The modified version contradicts this by saying that only material new uses require it, and even provides a monetary amount where the Licensee does not require approval.",

Licensee may not assign, transfer, pledge, mortgage or otherwise encumber this Agreement or its right to use the Brand (or assume this Agreement in bankruptcy), in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Licensor in its sole discretion, except for an assignment outside of bankruptcy to a successor organization that is solely the result of a name change by Licensee. For the avoidance of doubt, a merger, change of control, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the stock of Licensee shall be deemed an “assignment” requiring the above consent, regardless of whether Licensee is the surviving entity or whether such transaction constitutes an assignment under applicable law. Licensee acknowledges that its identity is a material condition that induced Licensor to enter into this Agreement. Any attempted action in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void ab initio and of no force or effect, and shall result in immediate termination of this Agreement. In the event of a permitted assignment hereunder, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted assigns.",

A merger, change of control, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the stock of Licensee shall not be deemed an “assignment” requiring consent under any circumstances. In the event of an assignment, Licensee may not be released from obligations, unless Licensor agrees.",
                "explanation": "The original text firmly states that the Licensee may not assign the agreement without written consent from the Licensor. The modified version directly contradicts this by saying the Licensee may assign the agreement to an affiliate without Licensor's consent, and a merger, change of control, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the stock of Licensee shall not be deemed an “assignment” requiring consent under any circumstances.",

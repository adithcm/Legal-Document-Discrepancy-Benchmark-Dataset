                "changed_text": "a) “CONTRACT PERIOD” means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties. The termination date of this agreement will be determined by Berkshire Bank, and may be subject to change based on market conditions and the bank's strategic objectives.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the contract period with a specific end date. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that the termination date is determined by Berkshire Bank and subject to change. This contradicts the original fixed termination date, creating potential disputes over the contract's duration.",

The modified version contradicts this by stating that Berkshire may assign or convey these rights to any third party at its sole discretion without Auriemma's consent.

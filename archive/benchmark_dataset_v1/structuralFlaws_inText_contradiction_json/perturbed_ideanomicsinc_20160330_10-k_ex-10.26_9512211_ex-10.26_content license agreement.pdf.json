                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 20-year term with specific termination conditions. The modified text adds a contradictory statement allowing the Licensor to terminate at any time, creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement.",

Licensee will share liability for fees and royalties that may be owed to third parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Licensor is solely responsible for all royalties and fees.

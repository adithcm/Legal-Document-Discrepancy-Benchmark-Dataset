Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non-cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor may request to cancel, reschedule, or modify a purchase order. However, Xplore reserves the right to approve or deny any such request at its sole discretion, regardless of when the request is made. Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non-cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives the distributor a clear right to cancel or modify orders within a specific timeframe. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that Xplore has the right to approve or deny these requests, negating the distributor's previously defined right. This creates a contradiction regarding the distributor's power to manage purchase orders, potentially leading to disputes.",

Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor’s inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",

Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor’s inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. Even if inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore is under no obligation to replenish the stock. Replenishment of stock will be considered, but is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that Xplore 'shall replenish the stock' under specific conditions. The modified text contradicts this by saying Xplore is 'under no obligation to replenish the stock,' even under the same conditions. This undermines the distributor's expectation of stock replenishment, creating uncertainty and a potential point of conflict. The addition of 'Replenishment of stock will be considered, but is not guaranteed' removes any binding requirement.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010, whereby Distributor’s price, includes all costs of delivery, insurance, import and / or export duties and tariffs. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products. Title and risk of loss to Xplore Products shall pass to Distributor upon delivery to Distributor, as indicated in the Proof of Delivery (PoD) documents.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be determined by Xplore on a per-order basis. Distributor will be notified of the shipping terms after placing the order. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products. Title and risk of loss to Xplore Products shall pass to Distributor upon delivery to Distributor, as indicated in the Proof of Delivery (PoD) documents.",
                "explanation": "The original section specifies DDP INCOTERMS® 2010 as the shipping terms, providing clarity on cost allocation. The modified section introduces ambiguity by stating shipping terms are 'determined by Xplore on a per-order basis' and disclosed after the order is placed. This contradicts the original defined terms and creates uncertainty for the distributor regarding shipping costs and responsibilities, opening the door for disputes.",

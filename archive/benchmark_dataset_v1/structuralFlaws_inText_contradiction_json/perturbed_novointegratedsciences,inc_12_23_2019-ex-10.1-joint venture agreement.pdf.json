                "original_text": "8.1\nThe initial term of this Agreement shall, unless sooner terminated by consent of all parties, expires in five (5) years from the date of\nEffective Date. NVOS and HGF may renew the Agreement within two (2) years of the expiry of the initial term upon mutual understanding.\n8.2\nIt is understood that a subsequent renewal of a five (5) year term will be negotiated in good faith and shall carry terms very close to the\noriginal Agreement.\n8.3\nBoth parties may enter into buyout negotiations with the other Party on terms agreeable to both Parties.",
                "changed_text": "8.1\nThe initial term of this Agreement shall continue indefinitely, unless sooner terminated by NVOS. NVOS and HGF may renew the Agreement within two (2) years of the expiry of the initial term upon mutual understanding.\n8.2\nIt is understood that a subsequent renewal of a five (5) year term may or may not happen and will be negotiated in bad faith and shall not carry terms close to the original Agreement.\n8.3\nBoth parties may enter into buyout negotiations with the other Party on terms agreeable to both Parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a five-year term with renewal options. The modification introduces contradictions by stating the agreement continues indefinitely unless NVOS terminates it, thus contradicting the initial term. The text also stated 'agreement can be negotiated in good faith and shall carry terms very close to the original Agreement' but the modified version states the opposite: 'may or may not happen and will be negotiated in bad faith and shall not carry terms close to the original Agreement.'",

                "changed_text": "9.3\nTo remunerate HGF on the basis of thirty percent (30%) of net Company income basis on an annual basis commencing 12 months after the\nfirst full 12-month revenue period. However, NVOS reserves the right to adjust this percentage at its sole discretion based on market conditions.\n9.4\nTo purchase product from the Company at a price determined solely by NVOS, with no obligation to consider cost.\n9.5\nTo issue NVOS common stock to HGF only if NVOS deems it beneficial, with the amount and conditions to be determined at NVOS's sole discretion. The successful target of twenty-five million dollars ($25M) of net profit achieved by the Company each fiscal year does not guarantee that NVOS will fulfill this obligation. If NVOS does decide to issue the stock, it is not obligated to use Novo Healthnet Limited (“NHL”) exchangeable preferred shares. All parties understand NVOS is a U.S. reporting publicly traded corporation and that any NVOS common shares issued, from exchanging the NHL exchangeable preferred shares, will be provided without the guiding U.S. rules and regulations. Furthermore, all parties\nunderstand these shares will carry different rights and conditions, with special terms or conditions, as all NVOS common shares\nauthorized for issue under the companies’ Nevada Articles of Incorporation. Any NVOS common stock issued to HGF, on or after the date\nhereof, is not subject to pro-rata adjustment in the event that NVOS shall, prior to the issuance date, approve any forward stock split, reverse\nstock split or other capitalization re-structure.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits NVOS to specific financial obligations to HGF. The revised text undermines these commitments by giving NVOS the discretion to adjust the percentage of net income paid to HGF, to set product purchase prices without considering cost, and to decide whether or not to issue common stock, contradicting the originally stated obligations. The initial text also stated: 'shares will be provided under the guiding U.S. rules and regulations' but the new version states that they will be provided without it. The initial text also states: 'these shares will carry the same rights and conditions, with no special terms or conditions' but the new version says the opposite and states: 'these shares will carry different rights and conditions, with special terms or conditions'",

                "changed_text": "21.3\nWhere a dispute or claim is not resolved by mediation, NVOS has the option to either proceed with arbitration or dismiss the dispute entirely, with no recourse for HGF.

The decisions of the arbitrator shall be only binding to HGF, and will not be binding on NVOS.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines a mutual arbitration process. The modified text contradicts this by giving NVOS unilateral control over the arbitration process, including the option to dismiss disputes, ignore the Arbitration Act, and not be bound by the arbitrator's decision. This introduces a significant power imbalance and contradicts the previously agreed-upon dispute resolution process. The first text also states: 'The decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties' but the new version directly contradicts this statement by stating that the decisions will not be binding on NVOS.",

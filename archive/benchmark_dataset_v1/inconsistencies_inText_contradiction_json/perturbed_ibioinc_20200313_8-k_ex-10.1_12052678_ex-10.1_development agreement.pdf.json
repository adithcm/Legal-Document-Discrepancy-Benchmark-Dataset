                "explanation": "Adding 'due within 30 days of presentation' to the final payment terms contradicts the earlier part of section 3.1, which doesn't specify a specific deadline for the final payment. This creates uncertainty about when the final payment is actually due, as section 3.1 only mentions 'upon presentation'. This could lead to disputes over late payment penalties.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'negotiations not to extend beyond ninety (90) days' to 'negotiations to extend beyond ninety (90) days' introduces a contradiction. The original text sets a clear time limit for negotiation, while the modified text suggests no fixed limit, which creates confusion about the allowable duration for negotiations and potential disputes over when negotiations have failed.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'date of disclosure' to 'date of signing' creates a contradiction with section 7.6, which dictates that some information may retroactively marked as Confidential. Marking confidential information after the date of signing would result in section 7.3 being violated due to the disclosure occuring before the classification. This could lead to disputes over whether a disclosure was permissible based on its date and create uncertainty about the enforcement of confidentiality obligations.",

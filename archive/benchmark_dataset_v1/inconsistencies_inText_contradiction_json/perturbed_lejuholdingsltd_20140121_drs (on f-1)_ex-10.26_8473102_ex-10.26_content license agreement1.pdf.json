Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee’s failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",

Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than **72 hours** after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority.

Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by replacing the Governmental Authority's timeframe with a fixed period (72 hours). This conflicts with the original text, creating ambiguity regarding the actual deadline for removing offending content. If a Governmental Authority prescribes a shorter timeframe, it's unclear whether the 72-hour clause supersedes it, causing enforcement uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a caveat that no reimbursement is required if the original tax payment was made more than 180 days prior to the reimbursement request, but the original text states reimbursement must be made within 7 days. This creates a contradiction between the immediate reimbursement obligation and the potential for non-reimbursement based on a 180-day rule, leading to uncertainty about the payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The added sentence states that Licensee can assign the agreement to any entity acquiring a majority stake in its business without Licensor's consent. This directly contradicts the initial statement requiring express written consent for any assignment, creating ambiguity and uncertainty about the assignment terms.",

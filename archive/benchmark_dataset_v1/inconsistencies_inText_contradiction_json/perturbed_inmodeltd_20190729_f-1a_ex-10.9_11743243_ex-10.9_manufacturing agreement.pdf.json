The modification changes it to 'current plus sixty (60) days'. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the actual payment deadline, as different sections of the contract now provide conflicting information.",

In the event that Customer, at its sole discretion, decides to repurchase any (or all) of the Products in said Period, and subject to the fulfillment of all Customer’s obligations in this Sections 8.2 (i.e. 100% of the Contract Price has been paid to Contractor), then the price for such repurchase shall be 0% of the Contract Price.

                "explanation": "Here, a change from 'thirty (30) days' to 'sixty (60) days' for claim submission introduces a contradiction. This conflicts with other clauses that might reference the original 30-day period, creating ambiguity about the deadline for claim submissions related to canceled or delayed products. This inconsistency affects obligations related to reimbursement claims.",

This contradicts any implicit references to the three-month period in other clauses regarding inventory management or forecasting liabilities, creating confusion and potential dispute over the holding period of FGI.",

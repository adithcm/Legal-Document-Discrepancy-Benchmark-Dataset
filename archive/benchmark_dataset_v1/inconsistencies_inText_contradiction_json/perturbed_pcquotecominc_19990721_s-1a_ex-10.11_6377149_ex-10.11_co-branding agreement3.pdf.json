                "changed_text": "3.\nTo the extent, if any, that provision of this Agreement\nconflicts with or differs from any provision of the Agreement, the original agreement's provision shall prevail and govern for all purposes and in all\nrespects, unless explicitly stated otherwise in this Second Amendment. This amendment is only to clarify details and doesn't change the scope of the main Co-branding agreement. In the case of conflict, the section with a later date governs.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. The original clause states that the Second Amendment prevails in case of conflict. The modified clause now states that the original agreement prevails unless explicitly stated otherwise. Later it states that the later date governs, directly conflicting with the second amendment taking precedent, causing inconsistencies.",

However, some sections of the Agreement are subject to future negotiations, especially regarding the duration and exclusivity clauses. Ratification only applies to the operational aspects of the co-branding, not the strategic ones.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction by introducing ambiguity about which parts of the agreement are fully ratified. While the initial statement confirms the agreement, the added sentence suggests that some sections, particularly those related to duration and exclusivity, are subject to future negotiations. Furthermore, only ratifying operational aspects introduces a scope for disputes and uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "While stating that the parties want to further amend the agreement, it imposes a restriction that the term of agreement will not be changed. This is an in-text contradiction. If they are going to 'further amend the agreement', they should be able to change the term, too.",

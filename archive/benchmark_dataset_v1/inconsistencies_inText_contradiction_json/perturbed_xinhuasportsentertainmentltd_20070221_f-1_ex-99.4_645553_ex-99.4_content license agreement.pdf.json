CONSIDERATION\n4.1  In consideration of the rights and obligations of the Parties, XFN shall\n     pay to CEIS US$1.1 million (United States Dollars One Million and One\n     Hundred Thousand) for a term of twenty (20) years, in cash or such other\n     consideration as the Parties may agree. The payment schedule shall be by\n     five (5) instalments of US$220,000 each. The first instalment will be\n     effect on condition that XFN can raise at least US$1.1 million additional\n     funding in 2002.",

CONSIDERATION\n4.1  In consideration of the rights and obligations of the Parties, XFN shall\n     pay to CEIS US$1.1 million (United States Dollars One Million and One\n     Hundred Thousand) for a term of twenty (20) years, in cash or such other\n     consideration as the Parties may agree. The payment schedule shall be by\n     five (5) instalments of US$220,000 each. The first instalment is due within 30 days of the effective date, regardless of additional funding. Subsequent installments are due every four years thereafter.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment schedule. The original clause states the first installment is conditional on XFN raising additional funding, while the modified clause states it is due within 30 days regardless of funding. This creates uncertainty about when the first payment is actually due, impacting enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The added sentence directly contradicts the original clause. While the original clause allows termination with 30 days' notice, the added sentence imposes a substantial financial penalty for early termination, creating an inconsistency and potential dispute over the termination process and cost.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the notice provision. The original specifies that notices sent by post are deemed delivered two business days after posting.

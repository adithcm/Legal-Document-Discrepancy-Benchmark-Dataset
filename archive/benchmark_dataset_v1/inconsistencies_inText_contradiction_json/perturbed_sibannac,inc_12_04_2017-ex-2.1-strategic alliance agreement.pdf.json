                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment 'NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.' The modified text changes this to 'NET 30 days from the date of the invoice, regardless of when client payment is received by COMPANY.' This creates a contradiction because Bravatek's payment is now tied to the invoice date, not the client's payment to COMPANY, potentially requiring COMPANY to pay Bravatek before receiving payment themselves. This creates uncertainty and a potential dispute.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement can be terminated with ninety (90) days written notice. The modified text changes this to thirty (30) days written notice.

                "explanation": "The original text requires COMPANY to indemnify Bravatek for 'negligence or intentional misconduct'. The modified text changes this to 'gross negligence or willful misconduct' for COMPANY, while keeping 'negligence or intentional misconduct' for Bravatek's indemnity obligation. This creates an inconsistency as COMPANY is held to a higher standard (gross negligence/willful misconduct) for indemnification, while Bravatek is held to a lower standard (simple negligence/intentional misconduct), causing ambiguity and potentially unfair allocation of risk.",

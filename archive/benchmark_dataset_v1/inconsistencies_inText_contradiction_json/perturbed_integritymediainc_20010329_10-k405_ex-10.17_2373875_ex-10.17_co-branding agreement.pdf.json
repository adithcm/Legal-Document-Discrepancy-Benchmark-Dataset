                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction with the later part of this section.  While the first sentence now states '90 days', the subsequent text regarding the audit period remains tied to the original '60 day' accounting statement delivery.  This creates uncertainty: does a party have only 2 years from 60 days post-quarter to audit, or 2 years from 90 days post-quarter?",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding the audit period. It first says the audit period is *one (1) year* from the statement date, but then says the auditing party *must make specific written objection within such two (2) year period* and can file an action within *two (2) years and six (6) months after the applicable statement is rendered.* It's unclear whether the audit is restricted to 1 year or whether that is extended to a full 2 years and 6 months. This ambiguity undermines enforceability.",

Upon agreement by both parties, the term can be extended for a period other than a year, or terminated prior to the automatic renewal.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text. The original requires mutual written agreement to extend the term. The new text implements an automatic renewal unless a party objects, but also allows for different renewal periods or premature termination if both parties agree.  This creates confusion about the actual term and the process for ending the agreement.",

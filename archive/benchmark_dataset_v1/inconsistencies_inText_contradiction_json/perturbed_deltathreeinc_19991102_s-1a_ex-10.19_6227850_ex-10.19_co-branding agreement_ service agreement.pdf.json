Any amounts due hereunder shall be\ncalculated and paid in U.S. dollars on a monthly basis within twenty-five (25)\nbusiness days following the receipt of the reports detailed in Sections 3.06 [Reporting] and\n4.02 [Reporting] hereof or any other invoices provided for herein. All payments shall be\nmade via wire transfer in accordance with written instructions from the parties.",

Any amounts due hereunder shall be\ncalculated and paid in U.S. dollars on a monthly basis within twenty-five (25)\nbusiness days following the receipt of the reports detailed in Sections 3.06 [Reporting] and\n4.02 [Reporting] hereof or any other invoices provided for herein. However, for invoices exceeding $10,000, payment shall be due within sixty (60) business days. All payments shall be\nmade via wire transfer in accordance with written instructions from the parties.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying different payment terms (25 days vs. 60 days) depending on the invoice amount. This creates ambiguity as to when payment is actually due, leading to potential disputes.",

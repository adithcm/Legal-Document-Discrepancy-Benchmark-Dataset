                "original_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the ability to influence the management or policies of a person or entity, through any means, whether explicitly stated or implied by the actions of the involved parties. This includes, but is not limited to, ownership of voting securities, contractual agreements, or strategic alliances.",
                "explanation": "This change broadens the definition of 'Control' from direct power or ownership to include 'influence' and 'strategic alliances.' This contradicts other sections of the contract where the original, stricter definition of control is implicitly used, such as in defining affiliates or determining liability, thus creating uncertainty about which standard should apply.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict in the termination clause. While the original text requires a 30-day notice for termination, the modified text allows for immediate termination in the event of a material breach by the Licensee. This creates ambiguity as to whether the 30-day notice period is always required or if it can be bypassed, potentially leading to disputes.",

The foregoing limitation of liability and exclusion of certain damages shall apply regardless of the failure of essential purpose of any\nremedies available to either party.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an exception to the limitation of liability clause. While the original text broadly disclaims all warranties and limits liability for various damages, the modified text carves out an exception for situations involving the Licensor's gross negligence or willful misconduct resulting in direct damages. This creates a contradiction, making it unclear whether the Licensor is truly shielded from liability in all circumstances, potentially exposing the Licensor to legal claims and impacting the enforceability of the original liability limitations.",

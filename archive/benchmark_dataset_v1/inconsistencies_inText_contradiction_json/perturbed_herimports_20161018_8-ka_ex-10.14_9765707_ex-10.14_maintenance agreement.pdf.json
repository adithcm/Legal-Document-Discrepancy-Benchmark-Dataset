                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1. EXTENSION OF SERVICE AGREEMENT. Subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein, as of the date of this agreement, LEADER maintain the software for an additional five years.",
                "changed_text": "1. EXTENSION OF SERVICE AGREEMENT. Subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein, as of the date of this agreement, LEADER maintain the software for an additional five years.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, Leader shall cease maintenance after three years if EZJR common stock falls below $0.10 per share for 90 consecutive days.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Section 1 initially states a five-year maintenance agreement. The added clause allows termination after three years under specific stock conditions, creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the service.",

The compensation to LEADER shall be: 3,000,000 shares of EZJR’s unregistered restricted common stock which shall be issuable upon the closing; however, EZJR may elect to pay Leader in cash equivalent of the stock value at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "This adds conflicting terms to the compensation. Originally, compensation is strictly stock-based. The modified clause introduces the option for EZJR to pay in cash, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over the form of payment.",

Each party will pay its or his own legal fees and other expenses in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the sale of Assets in accordance with this Agreement. However, if any legal action or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because or arising out of an alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and other costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it or he may be entitled.",

Each party will pay its or his own legal fees and other expenses in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the sale of Assets in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the following, in no event shall either party be responsible for the others legal fees.",
                "explanation": "Section 11 first outlines that the prevailing party in a legal dispute can recover attorney's fees. The modified clause directly contradicts this by stating that neither party is ever responsible for the other's legal fees, creating a clear conflict and making enforcement unpredictable.",

                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the “Non- Compete Period”), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer’s capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the “Non-Compete Period”), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer’s capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business, provided that any business generating less than $1,000,000 in annual revenue is exempt, or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business",
                "explanation": "The clause explicitly restricts sellers from engaging in any competing business during the Non-Compete Period. The modification introduces an exception for businesses generating less than $1,000,000 in annual revenue. This creates a contradiction because the original text prohibits all competitive business activities, but the modified text permits some, leading to ambiguity about what is truly restricted.",

                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits the sellers from soliciting or recruiting employees of the combined business. The modified text adds a condition that if an employee initiates contact, the restriction is lifted, creating an inconsistency. It's now unclear whether sellers are completely barred from soliciting employees, especially if those employees express interest first.",

Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the Buyer is entitled to seek injunctive relief for any breach. The modified text introduces an exception that breaches of section 1(b)(ii) (related to being a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any person engaged in any Combined Business) will only result in monetary damages. This inconsistency introduces uncertainty because it limits remedies available for particular breaches.",

                "changed_text": "6.2 Upon and subject to credit approval by Cisco, payment terms shall be [*****] days from shipping date. However, for all international orders payment is due 15 days from the invoice date. All payments shall be made in the currency in which the Price List is quoted for the applicable Purchase Order [*****].",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment terms. The original clause states payment terms are [*****] days from the shipping date, but the modified clause adds a condition that for all international orders, payment is due 15 days from the invoice date. This creates confusion as to which payment term applies to international orders and could lead to disputes.",

Furthermore, Distributor may only terminate this agreement for convenience during the last 30 days of the term.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows either party to terminate for convenience with [*****] days notice. The modified clause adds a condition that Distributor may only terminate for convenience during the last 30 days of the term.

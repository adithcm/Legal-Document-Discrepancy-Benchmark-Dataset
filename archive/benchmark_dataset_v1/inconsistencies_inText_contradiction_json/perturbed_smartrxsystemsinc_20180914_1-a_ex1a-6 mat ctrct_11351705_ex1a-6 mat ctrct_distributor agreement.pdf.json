Payment to the Distributor for the sale of the Products to Customers shall be as follows:\n(i) Company will pay Distributor (or its Assignee) Ten Percent (10%) of the Master Distributor Override generated by each\nCustomer Kiosk Location. (Master Distributor Override (\"MDO\") shall mean Total Revenue per Customer Kiosk Location collected by\nSRXS from third party payors and patient cash payments). This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a\npositive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the\nrevenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor. Additionally, it will be the\nsole responsibility of Distributor to make a full disclosure of the 10% MDO to all its clients.\n(ii) The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety\n(90) days from the end of the month).\n(iii) For each Customer Kiosk contracted and implemented by Distributor, Company shall also pay a management fee of 40% of\nNet Income (Net Income for this purpose is defined as EBITDA less percentage paid to the client. The balance is then split 40%/60% to A3\nDevelopment Group, LLC and Smart RX Systems, Inc. respectively). Net Income is defined as total Customer revenue collections less all\nincurred expenses, and is the distributable cash generated by each Customer location. These payments will also follow the payment policy\noutlined in 4.1 above.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in payment terms. Initially, section 4.1(ii) states that MDO payments are due within ninety (90) days. By altering this to sixty (60) days, we create an inconsistency. It is now unclear which deadline for MDO payments is the correct one, potentially leading to payment disputes.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the notice period for non-renewal. Section 12.1 originally states a 180-day notice period. By changing it to 90 days, the parties now have conflicting information on how far in advance they need to notify the other party if they don't want to renew the agreement.

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts section 15.1 by placing the arbitration in Orlando, Florida, while it was originally in Dallas, Texas. This causes uncertainty about which venue should be used for arbitration, leading to potential legal challenges.",

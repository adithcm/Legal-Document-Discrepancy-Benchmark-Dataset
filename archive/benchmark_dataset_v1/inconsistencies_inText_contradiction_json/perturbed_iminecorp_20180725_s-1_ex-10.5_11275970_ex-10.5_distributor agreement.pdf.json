The\ninvoice shall state the amount to be paid by the Distributor for all Products in such shipment, as well as any taxes, duties or\nexcises paid by JRVS which shall be reimbursed by the Distributor in accordance with Section 5.4. Terms of payment shall be net\nthirty (30) days. All payments shall be in U.S. Dollars.",

The\ninvoice shall state the amount to be paid by the Distributor for all Products in such shipment, as well as any taxes, duties or\nexcises paid by JRVS which shall be reimbursed by the Distributor in accordance with Section 5.4.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all orders placed after January 1, 2019, payment terms shall be net fifteen (15) days.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. The original text specifies a net 30-day payment term, while the added sentence mandates a net 15-day payment term for orders placed after a certain date. This creates ambiguity about which payment term applies, especially for orders spanning the date change, thus leading to enforcement uncertainty.",

This Agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason or no reason, whether\nor not extended beyond the initial term, by giving the other party written notice ninety (90) days in advance. However, JRVS may terminate this agreement with thirty (30) days written notice should market conditions change.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in termination terms. While either party can terminate with 90 days' notice, JRVS is granted the additional right to terminate with only 30 days' notice if market conditions change. This creates ambiguity and favors one party over the other, especially if the definition of market conditions is not clearly defined. This could lead to disputes over termination validity.",

                "explanation": "The original text states orders are non-cancelable except with JRVS approval and subject to cancellation fees. The added sentence allows the distributor to cancel orders within 7 days without penalty. This creates a direct conflict, as some orders are now cancelable without fees within a certain window, contradicting the overall non-cancelable nature. This creates enforcement uncertainty, especially when dealing with orders that are nearing the 7-day window",

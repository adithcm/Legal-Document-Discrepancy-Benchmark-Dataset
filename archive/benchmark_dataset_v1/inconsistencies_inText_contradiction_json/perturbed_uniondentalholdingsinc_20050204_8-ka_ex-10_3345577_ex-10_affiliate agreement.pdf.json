                "original_text": "a. Term. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until either Party informs the other Party with thirty (30) day prior written notice of termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "a. Term. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until either Party informs the other Party with thirty (30) day prior written notice of termination of this Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the above, UDC reserves the right to terminate this agreement with only 10 days written notice for convenience.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination notice period. The original clause states a 30-day notice is required for termination by either party. The added sentence allows UDC to terminate with only 10 days' notice, creating ambiguity and uncertainty about the actual notice period required, especially for UDC. Which clause holds more power?",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the retention of confidential information. The original text prohibits retaining copies except as legally required. The added sentence allows UDC to retain copies indefinitely for archival purposes, contradicting the general prohibition and creating uncertainty about the scope of allowed retention.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Business Affiliate shall not be required to indemnify UDC for any actions resulting from UDC's gross negligence.",

The added sentence carves out an exception for UDC's gross negligence, creating ambiguity about the scope of the indemnification obligation. It's unclear whether other types of negligence are covered, or if this exclusion affects related provisions.",

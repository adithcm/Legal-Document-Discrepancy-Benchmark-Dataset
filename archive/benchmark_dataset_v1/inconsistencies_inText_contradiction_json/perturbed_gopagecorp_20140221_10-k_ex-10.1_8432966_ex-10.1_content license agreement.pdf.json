                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding the cancellability and refund policy of the License Fees. The original text states they are non-cancellable and non-refundable, but the modified text introduces a cancellation clause with a partial refund. This inconsistency creates uncertainty and potential disputes over the financial obligations of the Licensee.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by introducing an extended payment deadline for the first year of the agreement. The original clause mandates payment by the 15th of the following month, while the added sentence allows payment within 30 days. This conflicting timeframe creates ambiguity over when royalties are actually due, creating potential for disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a clause introducing an indefinite auto-renewal with a 30-day notice period, directly contradicting the original clause which specifies a single three-year renewal term with a 90-day notice period.

                "changed_text": "Each of the parties acknowledge and agree that each other party may, but is not obligated to, cause one or more of such party’s affiliates to act on behalf of such party in the performance of its duties or exercise of its rights under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that a party *shall* cause affiliates to act on its behalf upon request, creating an obligation. The modified text changes this to a discretionary \"may\", creating an in-text contradiction. This contradiction introduces uncertainty in enforcement, since it is unclear if a party is required to involve its affiliates.",

For the avoidance of doubt, the recommendations of the Alliance Review Committee will not be binding upon any party unless and until this Agreement is amended or modified pursuant to Section 15.3.",

For the avoidance of doubt, the decisions of the Alliance Review Committee will be binding upon all parties starting 30 days after notification, unless explicitly rejected in writing by all parties, superseding Section 15.3 for any items under review.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Alliance Review Committee's recommendations are non-binding. The modified text states that a majority can make binding decisions unless explicitly rejected. This creates an in-text contradiction, making it unclear if the committee has real power or not.",

                "explanation": "The original text restricts Moelis Holdings from opening an office in Japan for the duration of the agreement. The modified text permits opening an office after the first year, creating a contradiction. This contradiction could cause disputes as to the permissibility of a Japan office after year one.",

The  term  (\"Term\")  of  this Agreement shall be for one hundred\neighty  days  (180)  from  the  date set forth below unless Network 1 or Visa or\nMasterCard  or Harris Bank doesn't approve Affiliate's ISO application, in which\ncase,  the  Term  will  be  3 years.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Network 1 reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time with no notice period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating the contract renews for one-year terms with 30 days' notice, but also gives Network 1 the right to terminate at any time with no notice. This creates uncertainty about the actual term and termination conditions.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a direct conflict. It states payments are dependent on Network 1 receiving funds from the Member Bank, but then limits Affiliate's Fee to 50% of the agreed amount. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment amount and conditions.",

Section 8.05 specifies the location for arbitration depending on which party initiates the dispute, while section 8.06 contradicts this by stating all arbitrations should be in McLean, Virginia.

The\nManufacturer will notify the Customer when the goods are ready for shipment prior to the goods leaving the warehouse.",
                "changed_text": "5.4\nPayment terms\nUnless separate payment terms are agreed to outside of this Agreement by both parties in writing, payment terms will be as follows:\n(i)\n50% of the Total Order Cost must be paid on placement of the customer’s order.\n(ii)\nThe remaining 50% of the total order cost must be paid within 15 days of the notification from the Manufacturer that the goods are ready for shipment. The Manufacturer will notify the Customer when the goods are ready for shipment.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict in payment deadlines. Originally, the remaining 50% was due *prior* to the goods leaving the warehouse, implying immediate payment upon notification. Now, the payment is due *within 15 days* of notification, allowing a grace period. This contradiction introduces uncertainty in when payment is actually required, leading to potential disputes. There's ambiguity about whether the manufacturer can refuse shipment if payment isn't immediate after notification.",

A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than\nbreach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency regarding the renewal term. Section 1.2 states the agreement is for ten years, and section 1.3 initially states renewal terms are also for ten years. The modification makes the renewal term five years, directly contradicting the implied continuation of the ten-year term, leading to uncertainty about the actual duration of renewed agreements. This impacts long-term planning and obligations.",

However, the manufacturer may sell any product similar to those listed in schedule A of this agreement to other parties without written consent.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction concerning the manufacturer's ability to sell similar products. Initially, the manufacturer needs consent to sell products listed in the agreement. The added sentence allows the manufacturer to sell *similar* products without consent. The ambiguity arises from the definition of 'similar'. Does it circumvent the exclusivity clause if the products are nearly identical? This creates uncertainty about what constitutes a breach of contract and opens avenues for dispute.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding when interest applies to late payments. Initially, late fees were applied after 30 days of Berkshire's invoice receipt. The change extends the grace period to 60 days, creating uncertainty and potential disputes about the correct deadline for triggering interest charges.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agreement is \nterminated for any reason other than Berkshire’s material breach, then for thirty (30) days following such termination, Berkshire may continue to \nuse any printed material already produced under this Agreement.

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by extending the payment deadline to 60 days in Section 10(c), while Section 5 could still reference 30 days. This creates a clear in-text contradiction, making it unclear which payment deadline is legally binding upon termination.",

                "explanation": "A contradiction is created by stating the force majeure leads to termination after a 30 days delay, while under section 5 the payment after termination is now sixty (60) days. These are conflicting deadlines which are both crucial to the agreement. Previously force majeure led to termination after 60 days, now 30 days. This introduces inconsistencies.",

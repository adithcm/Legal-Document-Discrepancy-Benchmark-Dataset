Notwithstanding the foregoing, all milestone payments outlined in Section 9.2 are to be paid within [***] business days.",
                "explanation": "This introduces an in-text contradiction. Section 9.5 states a general payment term of [***] for most payments, but the added text specifies a [***] business day payment term for milestone payments in Section 9.2, creating ambiguity about the applicable deadline.",

However, Sanofi has 60 business days after receipt of notification from RevMed.",
                "explanation": "This introduces an in-text contradiction. The original text allows RevMed to issue an invoice if Sanofi doesn't respond within [***] business days, but the added sentence extends Sanofi's response time to 60 business days, creating conflict and uncertainty on the enforcement of the timeline.",

All late royalty payments are subject to a 10% penalty, compounding daily.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction. The original text establishes a payment deadline ([***] after the quarterly report). The added sentence then introduces a penalty for late payments, but doesn't specify a grace period, conflicting with the existing [***] timeframe. This creates uncertainty regarding when the penalty applies, potentially leading to disputes.",

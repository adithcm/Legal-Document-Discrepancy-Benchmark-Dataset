                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original text states Dr. Murray will be paid no later than January 31st. The added clause introduces a discretionary payment window of up to 60 days after the end of the year, creating ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the payment deadline. This could lead to disputes over when the royalty payment is actually due.",

                "explanation": "The change creates a contradiction by stating the agreement remains in effect for 'ten years' in one sentence, but then changing it to 'five years' in the following sentence within the same subsection. This creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration, even though the royalty payments are supposed to continue perpetually. This contradiction directly impacts the enforceability and understanding of the contract's termination clauses.",

                "explanation": "The original text states notices delivered by mail are deemed received within three days, while the modified text changes this to five days.

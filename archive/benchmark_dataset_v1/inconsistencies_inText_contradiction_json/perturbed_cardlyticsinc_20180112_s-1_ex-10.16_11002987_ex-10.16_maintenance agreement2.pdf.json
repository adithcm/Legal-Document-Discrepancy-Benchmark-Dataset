However, if Bank of America does not terminate within 30 days of the price increase notification, the price increase is deemed accepted and no refund will be issued.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that Bank of America can terminate and receive a refund if the price increases, but then adds a condition that if they don't terminate within 30 days, the price increase is accepted and no refund is issued. This creates uncertainty regarding the circumstances under which a refund is applicable.",

In such events, the delivery and installation dates shall be automatically extended by a period equivalent to the delay.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a clause that contradicts the fixed Delivery and Installation Schedule by allowing for automatic extensions due to uncontrollable circumstances. This creates ambiguity regarding whether the original delivery and installation dates are firm or subject to change, thus leading to uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in payment terms. It states that invoices must be paid within 60 days but also allows Bank of America to dispute invoices within 30 days, delaying payment for the disputed amount. This creates ambiguity as to when payment is actually due and what the precise payment deadline is, specifically for disputed invoices.",

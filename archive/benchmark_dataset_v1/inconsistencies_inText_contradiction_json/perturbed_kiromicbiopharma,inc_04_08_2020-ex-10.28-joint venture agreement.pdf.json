                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Subsequent contributions will be provided by Kiromic to the common fund upon presentation of individual purchase orders and/or proofs of expenditure\n—which will be paid for each time starting upon the successful IPO (Initial Public Offering) of the Kiromic’s common shares.",
                "changed_text": "Subsequent contributions will be provided by Kiromic to the common fund upon presentation of individual purchase orders and/or proofs of expenditure\n—which will be paid for each time within 30 days of presentation, irrespective of the success or timing of the Kiromic’s common shares IPO.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original text makes Kiromic's payments contingent on a successful IPO. The modified text removes this contingency and imposes a 30-day payment deadline regardless of the IPO's status. This creates uncertainty about when Kiromic is obligated to make subsequent contributions, leading to potential disputes.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties may withdraw from this JV at any time, with or without cause. The withdrawal must be exercised by written notice, to\nbe sent to the other Party by certified letter or PEC, with minimum notice of 30 days.",
                "explanation": "The original clause restricts withdrawal to 'serious and justified reasons,' while the modified version allows withdrawal 'at any time, with or without cause.' This creates a direct contradiction about the conditions under which a party can withdraw, creating uncertainty and potential disputes regarding the validity of a withdrawal.",
                "location": "Section 9"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each Party recognizes and acknowledges that it is obliged to comply with the Anti-Corruption Rules.\nKiromic acknowledges receipt of a copy of MOLIPHARMA’s Anti-Corruption Policies and confirms that it has Anti-Corruption Policies in place\nthat are at least comparable to MOLIPHARMA’s.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party recognizes and acknowledges that it is obliged to comply with the Anti-Corruption Rules.\nKiromic acknowledges receipt of a copy of MOLIPHARMA’s Anti-Corruption Policies, but is not required to have Anti-Corruption Policies in place, and is not subject to the same standards as MOLIPHARMA.",
                "explanation": "This creates a direct contradiction regarding Kiromic's obligation to have comparable anti-corruption policies. The original text implies Kiromic should have comparable policies. The modified version explicitly states that they aren't required and are not subject to the same standards as Molipharma, which is a contradiction.",

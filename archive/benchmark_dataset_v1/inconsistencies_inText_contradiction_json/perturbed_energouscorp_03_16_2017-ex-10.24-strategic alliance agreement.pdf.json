Payments of Royalties and Service Fees will be due on a calendar quarterly basis, within [***] days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the applicable Licensed Products were Sold or services were rendered. From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise agreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of [***] per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.",

Payments of Royalties and Service Fees will be due on a calendar quarterly basis, within [***] days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the applicable Licensed Products were Sold or services were rendered. From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise agreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of [***] per month for the first month, and [***] per month thereafter, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict by introducing a tiered late payment fee structure. The original clause stated a single late fee, while the modified clause specifies one rate for the first month and a potentially different rate for subsequent months. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty about the actual late fee amount.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a clause that allows for the waiver of late payment fees if Dialog claims financial hardship.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the effect of delayed notice of a claim. The original text states that delayed notice only relieves Energous of its obligations if it is prejudiced, while the modified text removes this condition, stating that any delay automatically relieves Energous, thus creating a contradiction about ENERGOUS's obligations.",

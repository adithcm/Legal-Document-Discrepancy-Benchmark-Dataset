The Company shall conduct its Business in conformity with a business plan jointly\nprepared and agreed to by the Parties on or prior to the Effective Date, as may be amended from time to time after the Effective\nDate with the unanimous approval of the Board (the “Business Plan”).

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Business Plan can only be amended with unanimous approval of the Board, but the modified text changes this to a simple majority. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the level of approval required for amending the Business Plan, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text of Section 4.7 clearly states that revising the Business Plan requires unanimous board approval. The added phrase now says that revisions require only a simple majority. This is a direct in-text contradiction that creates uncertainty about the decision-making process.",

                "explanation": "Section 9.1.1 originally describes the conditions under which AFSL can exercise its put option. The added text introduces a new condition, a $10 million USD guarantee, which contradicts the original terms and creates uncertainty. Whether AFSL is required to provide a guarantee to exercise its put option is now ambiguous, affecting the enforceability of this section.",

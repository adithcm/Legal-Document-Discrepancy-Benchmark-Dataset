                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction by changing the grace period for late payments from twenty (20) days to thirty (30) days, thus creating uncertainty about when interest should begin to accrue. The modified text creates an in-text contradiction when different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.",

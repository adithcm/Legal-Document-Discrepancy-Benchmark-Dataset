                "explanation": "Changing the initial payment deadline from 'thirty (30) days' to 'sixty (60) days' creates a direct conflict regarding payment terms. While the subsequent payment dates remain unchanged, the initial deadline is now ambiguous, potentially leading to disputes regarding when the first payment is due. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as WPT may claim the original 30-day term applies, while Zynga can argue for the extended 60-day period.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause stating that the amount owed in the subsequent month must exceed $500 for the accumulated amount to be paid, we introduce an inconsistency. Now, one part of the clause says that the payment will only be paid if the amount owed to WPT exceeds $500. Another part indicates that payment will happen regardless of the owed amount in the subsequent month. This introduces a conflict about the condition for payment to occur.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that 'all payments made shall become immediately due and payable and this Agreement shall be automatically terminated' under force majeure. The modification replaces this with 'all payments made shall remain as agreed and payable until force majeure situation is over and this Agreement will not be automatically terminated.' This creates a contradiction. The original text specifies automatic termination and accelerates payment obligations, while the changed text prevents automatic termination and maintains the original payment schedule.",

                "changed_text": "Section 4.1. Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for a period of five (5) years, automatically renewing for subsequent one (1) year terms, unless terminated pursuant to Sections 4.2 through 4.4.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement continues in perpetuity. The modified text introduces a finite term with automatic renewals, creating a contradiction regarding the agreement's duration. This affects enforcement because it's unclear if the agreement is meant to last forever or only for a limited time.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for immediate termination for convenience by the licensor. The modified text requires a 60-day notice period for termination. This creates a contradiction about how quickly the agreement can be terminated for convenience. This affects enforcement, because it is not clear when termination takes effect.",

Any notices herein shall be deemed to have been duly given if (i) delivered or delivered by facsimile, when acknowledged by recipient, (ii) sent by U.S. Express Mail or recognized overnight courier, upon delivery confirmation or (iii) delivered by electronic mail, only with confirmation of receipt by the recipient:",
                "explanation": "The original notice clause states that notice is deemed given 'when received' for fax and email. The modified version requires acknowledgement/confirmation of receipt. This creates a contradiction regarding when notice is officially considered delivered. It affects enforcement because it's unclear whether simply sending an email or fax is sufficient, or if proof of receipt is needed, potentially leading to disputes over whether a notice was properly given.",

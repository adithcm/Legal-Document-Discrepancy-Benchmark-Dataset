                "changed_text": "(a)  HCI shall pay MLX a guaranteed fixed sum of [*] US per annum during the\n     Initial Term of this Agreement to be paid out as a monthly payment of [*]\n     US (the \"Monthly Payment\"). This Monthly Payment shall be due by the 10th\n     day of each month; however, if HCI provides supporting documentation of financial hardship, the payment due date can be extended to the 25th day of the month.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that monthly payments are due by the 10th of each month, but then adding a clause that allows for extension of the due date to the 25th of the month under certain circumstances. This creates uncertainty as to when payments are actually due, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows termination for failure to mutually agree on terms, while the added text restricts this reason for termination to only the first year of the agreement. This contradicts the initial clause, creating uncertainty about when termination is allowed and under what conditions.",

However, any assignment to an affiliate requires a written notification to the other party within 10 business days of the assignment.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows assignment to affiliates without consent, while the added text imposes a requirement of written notification within 10 business days of the assignment. This notification requirement creates an inconsistency, as the original clause implies no such notification is necessary. This ambiguity creates uncertainty regarding the conditions of assignment.",

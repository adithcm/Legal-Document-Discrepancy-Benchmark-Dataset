                "original_text": "Section 5.4 Payment. Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice no later than the last business day of the month Recipient received such invoice unless disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",
                "changed_text": "Section 5.4 Payment. Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice no later than fifteen (15) days after the date of the invoice unless disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within sixty (60) days of the invoice date shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding payment deadlines. The first sentence states payment is due by the last business day of the month the invoice is received, while the second sentence implies payments are due 15 days after the invoice date. The discrepancy creates uncertainty regarding when late fees are applied, as one deadline is based on invoice receipt and the other on the invoice date. Furthermore, it adds a 60 day grace period before interest is applied, contrary to the immediately preceding sentence.",

Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, upon 30 days’ prior written notice of such termination; provided, (a) that, with respect to the Services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A, unless otherwise indicated therein, those Services may not be terminated independently except in accordance with an agreed Migration Plan and, (b) any unamortized costs associated with Provider’s purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will be passed through to the Terminating Party.

Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, with no prior written notice of such termination. Upon termination of any Service pursuant to this Section 6.2, the Terminating Party’s obligation",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause that requires a 30-day prior written notice for termination for convenience. By removing this requirement, it creates an inconsistency regarding the proper procedure for terminating services and potentially introduces legal uncertainty if one party terminates without notice while the other expects it.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by shortening the period to obtain consent from 24 months to 6 months which could cause confusion on expectations and timelines. ",

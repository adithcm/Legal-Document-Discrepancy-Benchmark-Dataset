                "changed_text": "Within [***] ([***]) days after the Effective Date of this Agreement, Aimmune shall issue to Xencor shares of Aimmune Common Stock (the “Shares”) in accordance with that certain Stock Issuance Agreement, dated the date hereof, by and among Xencor and Aimmune (the “Stock Issuance Agreement”), and pay to Xencor by wire transfer of immediately available funds, into an account designated in writing by Xencor, an amount equal to five million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the “Upfront Payment”). The Upfront Payment is contingent upon the achievement of the first milestone as outlined in Section 7.2.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original text clearly states the upfront payment is due within a specified timeframe after the effective date. The modified text makes the same payment contingent upon achieving the first milestone, creating uncertainty about when the upfront payment is actually due. This uncertainty could lead to a payment dispute between the parties.",

Royalty payments are only required if quarterly net sales exceed $[***].",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original text mandates royalty payments for each calendar quarter. The modified text states that payments are only required if the quarterly net sales exceed a certain threshold. This contradiction creates uncertainty about payment obligations and potential for disputes over compliance.",

However, Aimmune shall have the right to appeal Xencor’s decision for termination to a mutually selected arbitrator within 30 days of Xencor’s notice. Xencor's decision to terminate will be on hold during arbitration.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a condition subsequent to Xencor's right to terminate, by allowing Aimmune to appeal to an arbitrator. This creates an inconsistency because section 13.2 gives Xencor the right to terminate for breach. The amendment delays or prevents the effect of termination pending the outcome of the arbitration. This impacts enforcement of rights.",

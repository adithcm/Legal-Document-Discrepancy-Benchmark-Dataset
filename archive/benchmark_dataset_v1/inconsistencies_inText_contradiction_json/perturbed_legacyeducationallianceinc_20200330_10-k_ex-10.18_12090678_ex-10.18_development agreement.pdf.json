                "original_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 15 days after the end of the applicable month. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 15 days after the end of the applicable month, unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing. If there's a dispute regarding the calculation of royalties, LEA has 60 days to resolve and make the payment. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "Section 9.3 initially states that royalties are to be paid within 15 days, but the addition provides that if the parties agree in writing payment can be made at a later date. The inclusion of a 60 day resolution period for royalty disputes further undermines the initial 15-day payment term causing uncertainty and potential for disputes over payment timing.",

The Term shall automatically renew thereafter for successive 5-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than 90 days prior to\nthe end of such five-year term.",

The Term shall automatically renew thereafter for successive 5-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination not less than 90 days prior to\nthe end of such five-year term, except that LEA may terminate the agreement at any time with 30 days notice if T&B fails to provide marketing support as outlined in Schedule 2.",
                "explanation": "Section 11.1 initially stated that the agreement automatically renews every 5 years unless 90 days prior written notice is provided. The change adds that LEA can terminate with just 30 days notice if T&B fails to provide marketing support. The reduced notice period and the condition create a contradiction that can create confusion in regards to the proper procedure for termination.",

                "explanation": "Section 12.1 states each party shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party. By adding 'except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the indemnified party,' the indemnification obligation is reduced or eliminated in certain situations. This creates a conflict and ambiguity, as it's unclear when the original indemnification terms apply versus when the exception takes precedence, potentially leading to disputes about liability.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from 'thirty (45) days' to 'fifteen (15) days' creates a direct contradiction and introduces uncertainty in enforcement. The parenthesis suggests a grace period which is undermined by the changed payment time.",

                "explanation": "Changing the default period from 14 days to 30 days contradicts with the earlier changed clause about payment within fifteen days. If a party does not pay within 15 days as said in clause 5.3, but termination only occurs after 30 days of notification as stated in the changed clause 11.2, then there is a contradiction about when a default on payment can lead to contract termination, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The added sentence 'However, in extenuating circumstances, the distributor may request a 30 day payment extension' creates a contradiction in terms of payment schedule. While clause 5.3 mandates payment within 15 days, the added sentence introduces the possibility of a 30-day extension, leading to ambiguity in the enforceable payment deadline.",

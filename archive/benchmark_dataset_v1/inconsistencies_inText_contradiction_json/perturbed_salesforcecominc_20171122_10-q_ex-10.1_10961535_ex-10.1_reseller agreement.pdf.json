This Sub-Reseller Agreement is effective as of the later of the dates beneath the Parties’ signatures below (“Sub-Reseller Effective Date”), provided, however, that the dates of the Parties’ signatures are not separated by a period of time greater than ten (10) business days. If such period is greater than ten (10) business days then this Sub-Reseller Agreement shall be deemed null and void and to be of no effect.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the validity of the Sub-Reseller Agreement based on the signature date separation. The original text states the agreement is void if the signature dates are separated by more than ten (10) business days, while the modified text states it's void if separated by more than fifteen (15) business days. This creates uncertainty about the actual deadline for signatures.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Sub-Reseller's status as a third-party beneficiary. The original text explicitly states that the Sub-Reseller is *not* a third-party beneficiary, while the modified text states that the Sub-Reseller *is* a third-party beneficiary of specific clauses.

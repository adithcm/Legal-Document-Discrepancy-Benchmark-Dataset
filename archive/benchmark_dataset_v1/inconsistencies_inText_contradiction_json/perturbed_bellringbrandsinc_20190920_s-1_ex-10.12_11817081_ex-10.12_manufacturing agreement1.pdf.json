Payment terms for these Product invoices shall be [***]. For Product produced at Heritage facilities, Heritage shall invoice Premier on the date the Products are loaded onto Premier’s carrier. Payment terms for all these Product invoices shall be [***]. Failure by Premier to meet payment terms of any invoice shall result in interest being imposed on any unpaid balance at the rate of [***] per month, pro rata on a daily basis for partial months, accrued from its due date or in the event such rate exceeds that permitted to be charged by law, the maximum rate permitted by law.",
                "changed_text": "For Product produced at Jasper facilities, Jasper shall invoice Premier on the date Jasper issues a Certificate of Analysis (COA) for those Products. Payment terms for these Product invoices shall be [***]. For Product produced at Heritage facilities, Heritage shall invoice Premier within 15 days of the end of the month in which the Products are loaded onto Premier’s carrier. Payment terms for all these Product invoices shall be net 60 days.

                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction regarding the invoicing and payment schedule for products manufactured at Heritage facilities. The original text states that Heritage invoices Premier on the date the Products are loaded onto Premier's carrier, and a specific payment term is applied. The modified text changes the invoicing date to 'within 15 days of the end of the month in which Products are loaded', and applies a 'net 60 days' payment term, creating uncertainty about the exact due date and payment obligations. This could lead to disputes over late payment fees and overall cash flow management.",

In addition, Premier shall purchase all Products and ingredients, packaging and material Heritage has on hand and not previously billed to Premier at the time of the termination that are used solely for the production of the Products, if any exist.

If Premier grants permission to order the quantity greater than a [***] supply, then Heritage shall not be liable for the excess inventory of this particular material. The cost of all ingredients and packaging material to be purchased by Premier shall be [***]. In the event that Premier has defaulted in its payment obligations hereunder, and failed to cure such default following notice as set forth in Section 11(a), Heritage shall have no obligation to deliver such releasable Product to Premier.

                "explanation": "The original text requires Premier to have satisfied *all* payment obligations for product delivery upon termination. The change introduces a contradiction by stating that only 75% of payment obligations need to be satisfied for the delivery of releasable product upon termination. This creates ambiguity as to what constitutes sufficient payment and what rights Heritage retains with regard to unsold product. This introduces legal uncertainty and potential disputes about product ownership and financial obligations.",

The modified text states 'At Heritage's discretion, Premier can direct Heritage to conduct a Recall Action' and 'the decision to conduct a recall will be at Premier's sole discretion'. This introduces a direct contradiction. It also modifies which party determines the manner, text and timing of publicity, introducing more conflict and uncertainty. The overall effect is to cloud the decision-making and operational responsibility for recall actions.",

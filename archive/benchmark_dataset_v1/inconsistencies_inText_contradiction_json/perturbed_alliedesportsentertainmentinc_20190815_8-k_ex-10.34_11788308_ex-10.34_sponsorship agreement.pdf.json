                "original_text": "14.1 Failure by Allied to perform and comply with any of its obligations in sections 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if Allied fails to cure the breach within fifteen (15) days following Newegg’s written notice of the breach.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by extending the cure period for breaches from fifteen (15) days to thirty (30) days. This contradicts Section 14.3, which specifies a fifteen (15) day cure period, creating uncertainty about the actual timeframe allowed for breach rectification. It creates ambiguity about which time frame to enforce.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by reducing the notification period for termination from sixty (60) days to thirty (30) days. This creates a contradiction regarding the amount of advance notice required, resulting in ambiguity as to which term is applicable. It creates ambiguity about which time frame to enforce.",

Further, if Sponsorship Fees have been paid in advance, the Sponsorship Fee shall be prorated through the date of termination and Allied shall refund the portion corresponding to the unused period of the Term.",

Further, if Sponsorship Fees have been paid in advance, the Sponsorship Fee shall be non-refundable, regardless of the reason for termination.",
                "explanation": "The modified text directly contradicts the original regarding the refund of prepaid Sponsorship Fees upon termination. The original clause states that fees will be prorated and refunded for the unused period, while the altered clause declares them non-refundable, creating uncertainty about the financial implications of terminating the agreement. It creates ambiguity about what refund policy to enforce.",

                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Affiliate(s)” means any legal entity which, directly or indirectly, at the time in question, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the designated Party. For the purposes of this definition, “control” is defined as direct or indirect ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting interest or economic interest in the controlled entity or such other relationship whereby the controlling entity determines or has the right to determine the majority of the Board of Directors or an equivalent governing body of the controlled entity. \n\nEXCERPT AFTER CHANGE",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Affiliate' based on control through ownership of 50% or more of voting or economic interest. Modifying this definition to include entities with 'significant influence' creates a contradiction. 'Significant influence' is a vaguer term than 'control' as originally defined, thus introducing ambiguity on which entities are considered Affiliates. This in-text contradiction can cause uncertainty when determining rights, obligations and liabilities of different Parties under the contract.",

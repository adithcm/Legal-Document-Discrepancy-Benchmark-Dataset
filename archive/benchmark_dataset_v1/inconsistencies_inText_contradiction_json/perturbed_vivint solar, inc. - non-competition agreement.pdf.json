This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales\nTerm” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar\nDeveloper, LLC (the “Term”).”",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue for a period of two (2) years from the Effective Date (the \"Term\").”",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the term based on the 'Sales Term' of another agreement. The modified text defines it as a fixed two-year period. This creates a contradiction because the 'Sales Term' in the other agreement might extend beyond or end before the two-year period, creating uncertainty about the non-solicitation term's actual duration and enforceability.",

The modified text adds a clause that *any clause that conflicts with this amendment will be superseded*.

                "explanation": "The original clause defers to the Master Framework Agreement. The addition stating 'in case of a dispute, this agreement will take precedence' creates ambiguity because it is unclear which aspects of the Master Framework Agreement are superseded, leading to potential conflicts about interpretation and enforcement. For instance, dispute resolution mechanisms described in the Master Framework Agreement may now be questioned. ",

                "original_text": "B. All payments are due on the later of: (1) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "B. All payments are due on the later of: (1) within thirty (30) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the tenth (10th) of the month following receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the tenth (10th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the payment due date. The original text states payments are due within fifteen days, whereas the modified text extends the deadline to thirty days. This inconsistency creates confusion about the correct payment deadline, undermining contractual obligations.",

Unless provided otherwise in a TSA between Carrier and Shipper, if any charge remains unpaid after the due date, then such amount due may bear interest from the day after the due date until paid, calculated at an annual rate equivalent to the greater of (1) one percent (1%) or (2) the maximum rate allowed by law.",
                "changed_text": "C. Unless provided otherwise in a TSA between Carrier and Shipper, if any charge remains unpaid after the due date, then such amount due will bear interest from the day after the due date until paid, calculated at an annual rate equivalent to the greater of (1) ten percent (10%) or (2) the maximum rate allowed by law.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the interest rate applied to late payments. While the original agreement states 1%, the new excerpt modifies the interest rate for late payments to ten percent. This creates an in-text contradiction because it provides conflicting information regarding how much interest will be charged, thereby undermining the contractual obligation.",

If Shipper fails to pay an invoice by the due date, Carrier will notify Shipper of the failure, and if Shipper has not remedied the failure within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from Carrier, in addition to any other remedies under this Tariff or under applicable law, Carrier shall have the right, either directly or through an agent, to sell any Products of such Shipper in Carrier’s custody at public auction, on any day not a legal holiday, not less than forty-eight (48) hours after publication of notice of such sale in a daily newspaper of general circulation published in the town, city, or general area where the sale is to be held, stating the time and place of sale and the quantity and location of the Products to be sold.",

If Shipper fails to pay an invoice by the due date, Carrier will notify Shipper of the failure, and if Shipper has not remedied the failure within ten (10) days following receipt of notice from Carrier, in addition to any other remedies under this Tariff or under applicable law, Carrier shall have the right, either directly or through an agent, to sell any Products of such Shipper in Carrier’s custody at public auction, on any day not a legal holiday, not less than forty-eight (48) hours after publication of notice of such sale in a daily newspaper of general circulation published in the town, city, or general area where the sale is to be held, stating the time and place of sale and the quantity and location of the Products to be sold.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces an in-text contradiction by reducing the time Shipper has to remedy a failure to pay from thirty days to ten days after receiving notice. This contradicts other sections specifying longer grace periods or dispute resolution timelines related to payments, creating uncertainty about the actual remedy period and undermining contractual clarity.",

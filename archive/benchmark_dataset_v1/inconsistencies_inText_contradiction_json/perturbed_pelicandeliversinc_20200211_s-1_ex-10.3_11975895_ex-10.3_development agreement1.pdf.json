                "explanation": "The original text specifies 20% payments upon completion of each of the four milestones, totaling 80% of the project fee. The modified text changes the final 20% milestone payment to include the 'remaining balance of $111,600.00', meaning the amount due after Milestone #3 becomes significantly larger than 20% and contradictory to the established payment schedule of equal 20% milestone payments. This creates a conflict and uncertainty regarding the amount to be paid after milestone #3.",

                "explanation": "The original text estimates 3 months for website completion, while the modified text 'guarantees' completion within 2 months. This in-text contradiction creates uncertainty. What happens if the website isn't completed in 2 months? Is there a penalty?

                "explanation": "The original states that the transaction completes after the ID check. The modification adds extra layers of confirmation for completion, requiring an automated confirmation, signed forms, and proof of payment. This contradiction causes ambiguity. It's unclear which steps are essential for transaction completion, potentially causing disputes or confusion.",

                "changed_text": "As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee, the “Post-Term Period” shall be one (1) year. (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating the post-term period is two years generally, but then specifying it is only one year if termination is due to the member's employment ending. This creates ambiguity as to the actual length of the post-term period in such cases, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating the member will pay all legal fees for violations, but then adding an exception for unintentional violations where each party bears its own costs. This creates ambiguity regarding the responsibility for legal fees and makes enforcement uncertain as it hinges on the subjective determination of intent.",

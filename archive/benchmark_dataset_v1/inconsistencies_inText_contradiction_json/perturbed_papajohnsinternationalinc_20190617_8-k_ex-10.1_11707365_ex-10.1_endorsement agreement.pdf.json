It is understood that PAPA JOHN’S shall not use the Celebrity Endorsement for any other purpose or in connection with any other items unless specifically permitted herein. Subject to the terms contained herein, PAPA JOHN’S and ABG agree and acknowledge that during the Term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, ABG shall be prohibited from granting any rights for CELEBRITY identical or similar to the rights granted to PAPA JOHN’S hereunder to any entity other than PAPA JOHN’S for the purpose of directly promoting, advertising, making an appearance on behalf of, or endorsing Competitive Products; provided, however, that in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section\n7.B. of this Agreement, the prohibition referenced above shall be for a period of six (6) months, except that the prohibition shall referenced above shall not apply (or shall immediately cease to apply, as applicable) in the event of any one or more of the following: (i) the Agreement is terminated due to PAPA JOHN’S failure to pay to ABG any monies under this Agreement, as set forth herein, (ii) the Agreement is terminated due to PAPA JOHN’S failure to grant, issue, or cause to vest any of the RSUs (as hereinafter defined) under this Agreement, as set forth herein, (iii) PAPA\nJOHN’S failure to pay to ABG any monies under Section 7.D.a. or Section 7.D.b. of this Agreement, as set forth herein, or (iv) PAPA JOHN’S failure to grant, issue, or cause to vest any of the RSUs under Section 7.E.a. or Section 7.E.b. of this Agreement, as set forth herein.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. The original clause grants Papa John's a non-sublicensable right. The added text then grants them the right to sublicense to franchisees without ABG's consent. This creates a direct contradiction regarding whether Papa John's can sublicense the Celebrity Endorsement.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates an inconsistency by first requiring Papa John's to maintain insurance for a defined period and then immediately adding a clause that allows them to waive this requirement. This contradicts the obligation initially established, leading to uncertainty about whether the insurance is truly required.",

                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a general confidentiality obligation. The addition of the explicit permission for Papa John's to disclose financial details to potential investors directly contradicts this obligation.

Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.”",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective as of July 3, 2019 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”). Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party.” However, for purposes of dispute resolution, Heritage will be considered the sole 'Party' with all decision-making authority.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that while both Heritage and Premier are referred to as a 'Party', Heritage will be considered the sole 'Party' for dispute resolution, which contradicts the initial definition of both being equal parties. This would cause confusion in a dispute.",

However, any payment due under the original agreement from Premier to Heritage is now extended indefinitely without accruing interest or penalties.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by stating that all other terms remain in effect, but then immediately contradicting that by altering the payment terms. It adds uncertainty as to which payment schedule should be followed.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a clear contradiction. The original clause suggests a mutual agreement to amend the contract. The added text gives Premier the unilateral power to modify the terms, directly conflicting with the mutual agreement implied in the original clause. This will create uncertainty in the enforceability of the agreement's amendment process.",

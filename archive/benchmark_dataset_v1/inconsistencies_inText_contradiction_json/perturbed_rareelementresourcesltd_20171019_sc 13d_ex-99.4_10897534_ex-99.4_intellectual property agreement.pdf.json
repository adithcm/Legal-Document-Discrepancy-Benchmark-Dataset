                "changed_text": "16.00 Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of this Article XVI, this IP Agreement and the licenses granted herein will continue in effect from the Effective Date until the expiration of the Option Period. In no event shall this agreement last longer than five (5) years from the Effective Date, irrespective of the expiration dates of any Patents.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the termination date of the agreement. The original text states that the agreement lasts until the expiration of the last patent and for a certain period after. The modified text limits the duration to either the Option Period or a maximum of five years, creating uncertainty about which provision governs the termination of the agreement. This could lead to a dispute if the patents extend beyond the five-year period.",

Investor hereby agrees to grant to Company a non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free license under any Investor Improvement and any patent claiming such Investor Improvement, solely for use in rare earth mineral processing and rare earth separation, to make and have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import products made using the Investor Improvements.

                "explanation": "The modification changes the license granted by Investor to Company from \"irrevocable\" to \"revocable.\" This creates a direct contradiction, because one clause states that the license is permanent, while the altered clause allows Investor to revoke the license, leading to ambiguity and potential legal disputes over the license terms.",

Investor will not assign to any Third Party any rights under this IP Agreement without the prior written consent of Company, such consent to be at Company's sole discretion and may be withheld for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) such rights are assignable by Investor to an Affiliate of Investor, subject to Company's prior written approval, and (2) Investor’s rights in Investor Improvements and Joint Improvements shall only be assignable by Investor to any Person following a 90-day written notice to the Company and Company's right of first refusal to purchase the rights at fair market value.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the condition under which investor can assign the contract. It moves from consent not to be unreasonably withheld to 'consent to be at Company's sole discretion and may be withheld for any reason'. It adds the condition that the Investor rights in Investor Improvements and Joint Improvements shall only be assignable by Investor to any Person following a 90-day written notice to the Company and Company's right of first refusal to purchase the rights at fair market value. This introduces a direct contradiction in assignment rights, making it uncertain as to the conditions that assignment must follow.",

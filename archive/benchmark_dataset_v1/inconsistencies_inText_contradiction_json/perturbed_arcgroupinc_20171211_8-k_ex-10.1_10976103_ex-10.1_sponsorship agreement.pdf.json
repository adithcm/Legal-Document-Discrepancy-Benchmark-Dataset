                "original_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each\ndue on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments. Three installments shall be due on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and August, and the remaining three shall be due on the 15th of September, October, and November of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict by altering the payment schedule for the annual fee. The original text specifies the 1st of each month between June and November. The modified text splits the payments, with the first three due on the 1st of the months and the last three due on the 15th of the months, thus contradicting the original payment terms. This creates uncertainty about the payment deadlines and potential for disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay the Playoff Payments in\naccordance with Section 2(d) of the Terms and Conditions not later than 30 days following Sponsor’s receipt of an invoice requesting payment for\nsuch Playoff Games; provided that Club’s failure to deliver such an invoice shall relieve Sponsor of any obligation to\npay any amount owed to Club for that specific Playoff Game. However, Club reserves the right to request this payment at a later date with an additional 10% interest fee.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the sponsor must pay regardless of whether they receive an invoice. The modified text states the opposite, that the sponsor is not required to pay if no invoice is received, relieving the sponsor of any payment obligation until the invoice is sent. Then there is the additional sentence about the Club reserving the right to request this payment later with an additional 10% interest fee.",

                "changed_text": "Any notice or other communication under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be considered given only when delivered\npersonally or by a nationally recognized overnight courier. Electronic mail is acceptable for routine communications only, not for formal notices requiring acknowledgment or legal action. Notices sent by registered or certified mail are not considered valid under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a direct conflict in the acceptable methods of delivering official notices. The original text accepts personal delivery, electronic mail (with confirmation), overnight courier, and registered/certified mail. The revised text restricts valid delivery methods to personal delivery and overnight courier only, explicitly excluding electronic mail for formal notices and invalidating registered/certified mail altogether. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding how official notices should be delivered and acknowledged, potentially leading to legal disputes over whether a notice was properly given.",

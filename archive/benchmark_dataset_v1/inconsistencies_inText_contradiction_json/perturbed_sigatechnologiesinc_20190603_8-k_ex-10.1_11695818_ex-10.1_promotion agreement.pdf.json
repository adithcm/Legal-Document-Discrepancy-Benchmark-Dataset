All such reports shall be considered Confidential Information of MMT. Concurrent with the delivery of the applicable Quarterly Report, MMT shall pay to SIGA in Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by SIGA in writing in advance of such payment the net result of Quarterly Collected Revenues, minus the corresponding Promotion Fee, and minus any applicable Credit Amount for such Calendar Quarter (all amounts as calculated in the Quarterly Report, and the payment of the net result being a “Quarterly Payment”).",

However, if there is a dispute between the parties, MMT will have 90 days to pay after the dispute is resolved.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by initially stating that payment should occur concurrently with the delivery of the Quarterly Report (within a specific timeframe), but then adding a clause allowing 90 days for payment after a dispute, potentially conflicting with the original concurrent payment timeline and creates uncertainty. The original clause mandates a prompt payment, while the added clause extends the payment deadline significantly under certain conditions. Thus creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the record retention period. The original text states MMT must retain records until the *later* of two dates (a specified period or the tax statute of limitations), but the added sentence imposes an absolute maximum of 3 years. This directly conflicts with the original 'later of' clause, creating ambiguity about the actual record retention obligations and uncertainty in enforcement.",

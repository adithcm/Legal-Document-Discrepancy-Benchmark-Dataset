                "original_text": "2. Payment Terms. Upon the signing of this Agreement, Client agrees to pay to Company a total of\n$5,000. Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 on completion of the\nScope of Work.",
                "changed_text": "2. Payment Terms. Upon the signing of this Agreement, Client agrees to pay to Company a total of\n$5,000. Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900. The remaining $3,100 shall be paid in monthly installments of $258.33, commencing 30 days after completion of Stage 1 of the Scope of Work, until paid in full.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment schedule. The original text states the remaining $3,100 is due 'on completion of the Scope of Work,' implying a single payment. The modified text changes this to monthly installments, creating uncertainty about when the final payment is expected and how much the client owes at different times.",

                "changed_text": "Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May\n3, 2018. Company guarantees completion by May 3, 2018, provided all client deliverables are received within 2 weeks of request. Failure to deliver on time will result in a 5% reduction of the total contract price. Alternatively, the project may extend to June 3, 2018, at the company's discretion, without penalty to either party.",
                "explanation": "This change creates two contradictory statements. First, it introduces a penalty for late completion, which is not mentioned anywhere in the original agreement, making enforcement unclear. Then it states the project may be extended without penalty. Therefore, conflicting clauses cause uncertainty about the potential penalties or remedies available if the project is not completed in the specified timeframe. Does client get money back or not?",

                "changed_text": "Client further agrees that Company may use and display the graphics and other web design elements of Client’s website as examples of Company website design and development work. However, Client retains the right to revoke this permission with 30 days written notice. To maintain Company’s portfolio credentials, and the integrity of any applicable copyrights, Company shall\nbe entitled to place an unobtrusive credit in the footer on the homepage of Client’s website; however, this credit must be removed upon the client's request.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Company 'shall be entitled' to place a credit, implying a right. The modification gives the Client the right to have the credit removed which contradicts company's entitlement of having the credit. This creates an ambiguity and potential for disputes: Does the company have an unconditional right, or can the client revoke it? This makes it unclear which clause governs the credit placement.",

Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to\nshipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. Section 4(b) originally states that the remaining balance is due 30 days after shipment. This modification extends that period to 60 days after shipment. This contradiction creates confusion regarding when late fees apply and what the acceptable payment deadline is, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. The original text states that prices will remain in effect for the initial 5-year term, while the modified text states the initial 2-year term. This directly contradicts the previous term and causes uncertainty about pricing for the entire duration of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that performance goals will start 120 days after receiving FDA market clearance. The modified text changes this to 60 days. This direct contradiction introduces uncertainty about when the minimum performance goals become effective, potentially leading to disputes about whether the distributor is meeting their obligations.",

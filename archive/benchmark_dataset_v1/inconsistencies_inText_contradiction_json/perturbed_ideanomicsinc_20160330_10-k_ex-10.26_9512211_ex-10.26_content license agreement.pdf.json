                "original_text": "(a) The Term of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall commence on the Effective Date listed above and continue for twenty (20) years, unless sooner terminated as provided in Section 7(b) [Term and Termination].",
                "changed_text": "(a) The Term of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall commence on the Effective Date listed above and continue for twenty (20) years, unless sooner terminated as provided in Section 7(b) [Term and Termination]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor may terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, upon 90 days written notice to Licensee.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the term and termination of the agreement. Section 7(a) initially states a 20-year term, subject to termination as per Section 7(b). The added sentence allows Licensor to terminate at any time without cause with 90 days notice, conflicting with the originally stated term and creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the contract and the conditions for its termination.",

                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee shall have a 60-day cure period for any alleged breach.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the cure period for breaches. The original clause specifies a 30-day cure period for any material breach. The added sentence grants Licensee a 60-day cure period, conflicting with the original 30-day period and creating ambiguity about the time allowed to remedy a breach. This will cause uncertainty in enforcement if the Licensor is the breaching party.",

                "changed_text": "Neither party may assign its rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement to any third party in whole or in part, without the other party’s prior written consent, except that (i) Licensee may assign its rights and obligations to this Agreement to any of its Affiliate or subsidiaries with the prior written consent of the Licensor, and (ii) Licensor may freely assign its rights and obligations in this Agreement without the Licensee's consent. Licensee however may not assign this agreement under any circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction concerning assignment rights. The original section outlines the conditions under which both parties can assign their rights and obligations. The modified text grants Licensor the right to freely assign its rights, removing the requirement of Licensee's consent, while simultaneously prohibiting Licensee from assigning this agreement at all. This conflicting language generates ambiguity regarding assignment terms, especially concerning Licensee's options, and may lead to disputes.",

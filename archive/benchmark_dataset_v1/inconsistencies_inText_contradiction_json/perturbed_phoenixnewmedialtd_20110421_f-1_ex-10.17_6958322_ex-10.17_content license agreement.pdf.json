In the event that such dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) Business Days following such notice, either Party may upon the expiration of the such 30-day notice period submit such dispute to arbitration by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the arbitration rules of such centre then in effect. The arbitration shall be conducted in Hong Kong in English and the arbitral award shall be binding upon both Parties. During the resolution (including the arbitration) of the dispute, the Parties shall continue to perform other portions of this Agreement unaffected by such dispute.",

This introduces uncertainty as to when a party can legitimately move to arbitration, potentially leading to disputes over whether the negotiation period was adequately exhausted.",

                "original_text": "If Reseller fails to submit Orders with an aggregate value equal to or greater than the MOQ, then Reseller shall pay Supplier a sum equal to the shortfall, within 30 days after the end of the Initial Term. Upon payment of such amount, Seller shall deliver the Products paid for to Reseller in a commercially reasonable timeframe (and in no event any later than 150 days from the date such payment is received in full) to be sold by Reseller in accordance with this Agreement as contemplated by the last sentence of Section 12.4.",
                "changed_text": "If Reseller fails to submit Orders with an aggregate value equal to or greater than the MOQ, then Reseller shall pay Supplier a sum equal to the shortfall, within 30 days after the end of the Initial Term. Upon payment of such amount, Seller shall deliver the Products paid for to Reseller within 60 days from the end of the initial term to be sold by Reseller in accordance with this Agreement as contemplated by the last sentence of Section 12.4.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Supplier will deliver products no later than 150 days after payment is received in full from the Reseller for failing to meet the MOQ. The modified text changes this delivery timeframe to be within 60 days from the end of the initial term, creating a contradiction. This leads to uncertainty about when the Reseller can expect to receive the Products.",

The modified text states that a party can terminate the agreement with 1 month notice after the initial term. This is a contradiction in the notification period required for termination of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. The modified text changes the governing law to the State of Delaware. This creates a contradiction regarding which state's laws will be used to interpret the contract, which leads to uncertainty regarding dispute resolution and contract enforcement.",

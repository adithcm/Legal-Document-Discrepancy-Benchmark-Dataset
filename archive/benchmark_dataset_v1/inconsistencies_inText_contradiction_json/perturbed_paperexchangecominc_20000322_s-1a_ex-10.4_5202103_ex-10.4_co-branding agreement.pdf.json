Each party shall provide the other party with all\namounts due under this Agreement for the prior calendar quarter within 30 days\nafter the end of each calendar quarter during the Term. Each payment shall be\naccompanied by a statement detailing the amount of applicable gross revenue\nreceived, the calculation of the amount due to the other party and the amount of\nthe payment accompanying such statement. All payments due to either party\nhereunder shall be made in immediately available U.S. funds, without set-off or\ncounterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for or grossed up for, as\napplicable), any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or\nconditions of any nature imposed or levied by any governmental taxing or other\nauthority.",

Each party shall provide the other party with all\namounts due under this Agreement for the prior calendar quarter within 60 days\nafter the end of each calendar quarter during the Term.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the payment deadline from 30 days to 60 days after the end of each calendar quarter. This directly conflicts with any other clauses relying on the initial 30-day payment term, causing uncertainty and potential disputes regarding payment deadlines.",

                "explanation": "This introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the interest rate on late payments, changing it to the higher of 3% or the maximum legal rate. This contradicts the original clause specifying the lower of 1% or the maximum legal rate, creating uncertainty about the applicable interest rate and potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the termination clause by swapping the cure periods for payment obligation breaches (originally 30 days) and other breaches (originally 45 days), making them 60 days and 30 days, respectively. The additional cure period is also reduced from 180 to 90 days. This creates significant ambiguity regarding termination rights and deadlines, especially concerning payment defaults, leading to potential legal disputes.",

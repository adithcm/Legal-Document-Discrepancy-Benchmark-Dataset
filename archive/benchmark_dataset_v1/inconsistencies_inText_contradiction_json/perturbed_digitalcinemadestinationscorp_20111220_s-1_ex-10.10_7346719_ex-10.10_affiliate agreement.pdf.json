Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all amounts due by one Party to the other under this Agreement, less any permitted deductions, shall be paid in full within sixty (60) days after the fiscal month in which such amounts were received by the paying Party, or the receipt by the paying Party of an invoice therefore, as applicable.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by changing the payment deadline from 60 days to 30 days. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as one section mandates payment within 60 days, while the other requires it within 30 days. This could lead to disputes over late fees or breach of contract claims.",

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, and upon reasonable prior notice to Network Affiliate, NCM shall be entitled to enter the Theatres upon reasonable prior written notice, and any other premises of Network Affiliate where any NCM Property may be located, and recover any and all NCM Property, unless Network Affiliate chooses to purchase such Property based on a straight line five year depreciated value. In addition, each Party shall promptly deliver to the other or, at the other Party’s option, permit the other Party to enter its premises and recover any Equipment in the first Party’s possession, custody or control which may be owned by the other Party pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof. Each Party shall fully cooperate in this effort. NCM shall be obligated to restore all premises from which it removes NCM Property or Equipment to its previous condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. In addition, any and all licenses granted by either party to the other under this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and NCM shall be entitled to immediately discontinue the Service. Notwithstanding termination of this Agreement, each party shall pay to the other, within five (5) days after the effective date of such termination, any and all fees (including costs and expenses) owed hereunder as of such termination.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting payment terms upon termination. The original text stated that payment should be made within five (5) days after termination, but the modified text gives a ninety (90) day window. This creates confusion and potential disputes regarding the acceptable timeframe for settling outstanding payments after the contract ends.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by modifying the terms of the license granted to Network Affiliate to use NCM Marks. Initially, the license was non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, and required written approval from NCM for both the use of NCM Marks in connection with the Service and in marketing materials. The modified text makes the license transferable, sublicenseable, and removes the requirement for NCM's approval. The added language which mentions that any goodwill arising out of the use of the NCM Marks or any of them by Network Affiliate shall inure to the sole benefit of Network Affiliate for all purposes hereof is an additional conflict, as it was meant to inure to the sole benefit of NCM for all purposes hereof. This contradiction introduces uncertainty as to the extent of Network Affiliate's rights and NCM's control over the use of its trademarks, potentially leading to disputes over brand control and licensing agreements.",

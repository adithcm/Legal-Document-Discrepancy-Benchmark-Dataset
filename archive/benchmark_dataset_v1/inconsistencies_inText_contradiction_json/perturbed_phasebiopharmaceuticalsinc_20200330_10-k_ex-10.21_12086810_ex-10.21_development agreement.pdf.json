                "explanation": "This change creates an inconsistency by extending the payment deadline for the Initial Development Cost Payment from 45 days to 90 days after the specified conditions are met. This contradicts the original clause, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces an in-text contradiction by adding a 30-day grace period to the late payment clause. Previously, interest accrued immediately from the due date. Now, there is a period where it does not, causing a contradiction about when late payment interest begins to accrue and creating uncertainty.",

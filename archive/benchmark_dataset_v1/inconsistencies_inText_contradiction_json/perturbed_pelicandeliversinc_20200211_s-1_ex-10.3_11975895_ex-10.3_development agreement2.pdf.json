Any Change\nRequest shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence\nof a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",

Any Change\nRequest shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence\nof a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the timeframe for submitting a Change Request from ten (10) days to five (5) days. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it's unclear whether the client has 5 or 10 days to identify issues with a Milestone Deliverable, potentially leading to disputes over whether a deliverable was properly accepted.",

If the completed Subject Program does not satisfy the Client's\nAcceptance Tests and Client provides Developer a Change Request concerning the same, Developer will have fifteen (15) calendar days from the\nreceipt of such Change Request to correct the deficiencies errors, corrections, modifications, bug-fixes or changes. Client shall then have ten (10)\nadditional days to inspect, test and reevaluate the completed and modified Subject Program or Final Deliverable. If the Subject Program or Final\nDeliverable still does not satisfy the Client's acceptance criteria and/or the Acceptance Tests, Client shall have the option of either: (a) repeating the\nprocedure set forth above; or (b) terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement . If the Client does not notify the Developer\nof any further failures, objections, changes, or other defects, or bugs of or in the Subject Program via a Change Request, Client will be deemed to\nhave accepted the Subject Program.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces three conflicting deadlines: Client's initial testing period is reduced to 10 days, Developer's correction period is extended to 20 days, and Client's re-evaluation period is reduced to 5 days. The original timeframe was 15, 15 and 10 days respectively. These changes contradict the original, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over acceptance timelines and the termination rights triggered by unmet deadlines.",

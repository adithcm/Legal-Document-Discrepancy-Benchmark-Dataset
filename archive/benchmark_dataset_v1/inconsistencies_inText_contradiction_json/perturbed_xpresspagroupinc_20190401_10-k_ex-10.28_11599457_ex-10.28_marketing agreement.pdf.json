XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such commission be greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",

XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such commission be greater than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by increasing the maximum allowable commission from 15% to 25%, conflicting with potential later clauses that might rely on the original 15% limit. This introduces uncertainty in the correct commission amount, potentially leading to disputes over payments.",

                "original_text": "8.06. With respect to Products sold in Stores in the Territory, XSPA shall deliver to Calm within twenty (20) days after each calendar month, a statement (“Monthly Statement”) identifying (i) the total sales of each Product during said calendar month and (ii) the total commission paid to XSPA employees or contractors under Section ​8.02, which shall include a breakdown by each individual Product and Store. Each Monthly Statement shall be fully completed and signed and certified as accurate by one of XSPA’s senior officers.",

With respect to Products sold in Stores in the Territory, XSPA shall deliver to Calm within thirty (30) days after each calendar month, a statement (“Monthly Statement”) identifying (i) the total sales of each Product during said calendar month and (ii) the total commission paid to XSPA employees or contractors under Section ​8.02, which shall include a breakdown by each individual Product and Store. Each Monthly Statement shall be fully completed and signed and certified as accurate by one of XSPA’s senior officers.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the deadline for delivering the Monthly Statement from 20 days to 30 days. This contradicts the original 20-day deadline. This discrepancy could lead to disputes regarding late submissions and enforcement of deadlines, especially if other clauses rely on the original 20-day period.",

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Calm (at its sole expense) may engage a third party to audit XSPA’s inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store and XSPA shall promptly return or dispose of such inventory as instructed by Calm at Calm’s sole expense. In addition, if Calm does not provide XSPA with instructions within twenty (20) days of the termination or expiration of this Agreement, XSPA shall be permitted to dispose of any inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store. The Parties agree to promptly settle all accounting associated with such inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store upon termination or expiration of this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth herein, all of the rights granted hereunder shall automatically terminate and XSPA shall immediately cease the distribution, marketing and sale of Products and the Parties shall discontinue all use of the other Party’s Marks.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces two contradictions: First, it changes the timeframe for Calm to provide disposal instructions from 20 to 30 days. Second, it stipulates a 10-day timeframe to settle all accounting issues associated with the collateral. The first changes modifies Calm's deadline to provide disposal instructions and the second creates a new contradictory payment term by mandating that payments should be settled in 10 days.",

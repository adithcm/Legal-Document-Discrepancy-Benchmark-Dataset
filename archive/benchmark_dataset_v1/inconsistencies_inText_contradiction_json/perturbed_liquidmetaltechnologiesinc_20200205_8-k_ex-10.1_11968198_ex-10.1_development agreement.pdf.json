Eutectix may issue an invoice for Liquidmetal Products any time after the shipment thereof to Liquidmetal.\nPayment terms are net 30 days after the date of the invoice, or the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice if the invoice is\nreceived more than 10 days after the date of the invoice. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise\nagreed in writing by the Parties, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "3.2\nPayment Terms. Eutectix may issue an invoice for Liquidmetal Products any time after the shipment thereof to Liquidmetal.\nPayment terms are net 60 days after the date of the invoice, or the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice if the invoice is\nreceived more than 10 days after the date of the invoice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for invoices exceeding $100,000, payment terms shall be net 90 days after the date of invoice. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise\nagreed in writing by the Parties, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment terms of net 30 days. The modified text changes the payment term to net 60 days and introduces a new condition for invoices over $100,000 to be net 90 days. This creates a contradiction as the original 30-day term is no longer consistently applicable. This inconsistency introduces uncertainty and potential disputes over payment deadlines.",

Acceptance of the Liquidmetal Product shall be based on characteristics that are measurable by a quality system\nand designed to demonstrate compliance with the Specifications. Unless Liquidmetal notifies Eutectix that the Liquidmetal\nProduct does not meet the Specifications within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Liquidmetal Product, then the\nLiquidmetal Product shall be deemed Accepted.",

Acceptance of the Liquidmetal Product shall be based on characteristics that are measurable by a quality system\nand designed to demonstrate compliance with the Specifications. Unless Liquidmetal notifies Eutectix that the Liquidmetal\nProduct does not meet the Specifications within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the Liquidmetal Product, then the\nLiquidmetal Product shall be deemed Accepted. However, for complex components as defined by Liquidmetal, the acceptance period is extended to forty-five (45) calendar days.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a 30-day acceptance period. The modified text changes this to 15 days but then introduces an exception for 'complex components' where the acceptance period is 45 days. This contradiction creates ambiguity because there's no clear, objective definition of what constitutes a 'complex component', potentially leading to disputes over the applicable acceptance deadline.",

Either Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason upon providing 90 days prior written\nnotice to the other Party prior to the expiration of the then-current term or unless sooner terminated in accordance with the\nterms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Liquidmetal may terminate this agreement with 30 days written notice if Eutectix experiences a Material Adverse Effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 180-day notice period for termination for convenience. The modified text changes this to 90 days while also introducing an exception where Liquidmetal can terminate with only 30 days' notice if Eutectix experiences a Material Adverse Effect. This is a contradiction because the initial 180-day notice is not universally applicable, and 'Material Adverse Effect' is vaguely defined, leading to potential disputes about which termination clause applies.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction. The original text says the Servicer *may* deposit collections on the second business day before each Payment Date. The modified text says the Servicer *must* deposit collections within five business days of receipt. This creates an inconsistency as one is permissive and the other is mandatory and on a different timeline. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement.",

If in a legal proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce its rights or remedies with respect to a Receivable on the grounds that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce rights or remedies with respect to the Receivable, the Issuer will, at the Servicer’s expense and direction, assign the Receivable to the Servicer solely for that purpose or take steps to enforce its rights and remedies with respect to the Receivable, including bringing suit in the names of the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders and the Issuer.",

If in a legal proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce its rights or remedies with respect to a Receivable on the grounds that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce rights or remedies with respect to the Receivable, the Issuer will never assign the receivable to the servicer but must enforce its rights and remedies with respect to the Receivable, including bringing suit in the names of the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders and the Issuer.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation creates an in-text contradiction regarding the process of legal enforcement. The original text states that, under certain conditions, the Issuer *will* assign the Receivable to the Servicer or enforce its rights. The revised text states that the Issuer will *never* assign the Receivable but always enforce its rights. This contradictory instruction introduces legal uncertainty. This is inconsistent with the enforcement obligations.",

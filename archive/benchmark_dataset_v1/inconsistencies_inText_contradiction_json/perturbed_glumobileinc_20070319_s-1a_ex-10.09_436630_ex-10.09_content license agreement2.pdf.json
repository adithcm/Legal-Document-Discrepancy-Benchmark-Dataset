                "explanation": "This change makes the payment of the 'ICE AGE 2 Guarantee' less certain. The original text states 'Licensee shall pay,' creating a firm obligation. The modified text introduces 'Licensee shall endeavor to pay' and ties the payment to 'cash flow availability,' creating ambiguity and a potential contradiction if later sections assume a guaranteed payment date.",

                "explanation": "The modified text adds uncertainty to both the remittance from Fox to Licensee and the subsequent royalty payment from Licensee to Fox. By changing 'shall remit' to 'may remit at its discretion' and 'shall pay' to 'might pay, subject to mutual agreement,' the clause now contradicts the original intent of a clear, defined payment process. This ambiguity could lead to disputes.",

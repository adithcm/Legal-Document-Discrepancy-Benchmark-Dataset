                "changed_text": "9.3\nTo remunerate HGF on the basis of thirty percent (30%) of net Company income basis on an annual basis commencing immediately after the Effective Date. HGF will receive an advance payment of $10,000 USD per month, deducted from the annual thirty percent (30%) of net Company income.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that HGF will be remunerated commencing immediately after the Effective Date, while the original text states that remuneration will begin 12 months after the first full 12-month revenue period. There is also an advance payment that affects the payment terms.",

NVOS has the right to delay or withhold distribution payments if cash flow conditions dictate.",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by altering the distribution percentages (70/30 to 60/40), changing the distribution review from audited to unaudited, extending the payment deadline, and giving NVOS the right to delay payments.",

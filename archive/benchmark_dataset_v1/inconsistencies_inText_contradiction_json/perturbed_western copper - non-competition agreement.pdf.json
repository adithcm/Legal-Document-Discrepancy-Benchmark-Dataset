                "changed_text": "Affiliate means, in respect of a party hereto, any entity in which a party holds any ownership stake, regardless of the percentage, or any entity with which the party has a business relationship.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies control through subsidiary relationships or common control. The revised definition broadens this to include any entity with any ownership stake, regardless of percentage, or even just a business relationship. This contradicts the intent of 1.3, which likely assumes a more significant level of control for extending obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Western Copper may, at its option, terminate this Agreement by providing 30 days written notice to \nGlamis. However, this right of termination is waived if Glamis ceases conducting \nbusiness in the normal course, becomes insolvent, make a general assignment for the benefit of \ncreditors, suffer or permit the appointment of a receiver for its business or assets or avail itself \nof, or become subject to, any proceedings under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) or \nany other statute of any province or state relating to insolvency or the protection of rights of \ncreditors; in such cases, the agreement is automatically terminated without notice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows immediate termination by Western Copper under specific circumstances. The changed text introduces a 30-day notice period for normal termination, but then states that the right to terminate with notice is waived should any of those specific circumstances occur as it will be automatically terminated, resulting in an immediate, no-notice termination. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the required notice period.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires good faith negotiation, implying a genuine attempt to reach an agreement. The changed clause explicitly states that Glamis is not obligated to negotiate and can refuse any offer. This directly contradicts the requirement for good faith negotiation and the intent to reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",

                "explanation": "By explicitly restricting the Honeywell Shared IP license in Section 3.01(a) to only Patents, while the original definition encompassed Patents, Trade Secrets, copyrighted content, proprietary know-how, and other Intellectual Property Rights, creates a direct conflict with other sections of the contract that rely on the broader definition of Honeywell Shared IP. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as it's unclear whether SpinCo is entitled to use the other forms of IP originally included within the definition.",

                "explanation": "By removing the five-year limitation on Honeywell's restrictions concerning SpinCo's IP in Section 3.02(a), while retaining it elsewhere (like Section 3.02(b) where SpinCo is supposed to notify Honeywell of infringement for only 5 years), an in-text contradiction is created. It introduces uncertainty, because in one clause, Honeywell is perpetually bound to these restrictions, while elsewhere, the notification duty related to infringement is limited to five years, and in Section 3.01 (c), additional licenses are for a period of five years as well.",

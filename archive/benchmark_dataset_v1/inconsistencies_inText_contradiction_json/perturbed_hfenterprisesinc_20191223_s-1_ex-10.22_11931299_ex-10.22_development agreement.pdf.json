As payment for Developer’s satisfactory performance of the services set forth in Schedule 1 hereto\n(the “Technology Development Services”), DSS shall pay Developer the sum of US $23,000 per month, for the duration of the Term hereof, with\npayments to commence on March 1, 2018.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. Development Fees. As payment for Developer’s satisfactory performance of the services set forth in Schedule 1 hereto\n(the “Technology Development Services”), DSS shall pay Developer the sum of US $23,000 per month, for the first six months of the Term hereof, with\npayments to commence on March 1, 2018. For the remaining period of the Term, the monthly payment will be US $11,500.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the payment terms. Initially, the contract states a fixed monthly payment for the entire duration of the term. The modification introduces a reduced payment amount after the initial six months, conflicting with the original fixed-payment agreement. This can cause uncertainty about the payment amount for months 7-12 and beyond.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of\ntwelve (12) months (the “Initial Term”). The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30-\ndays advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof.

The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30-\ndays advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, DSS retains the right to discontinue automatic renewal at its sole discretion. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any\nextension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the “Term”.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict regarding the automatic renewal of the agreement. The original text specifies automatic renewal unless a 30-day termination notice is given. The modification gives DSS the unilateral right to discontinue automatic renewal, contradicting the original 'automatic renewal' clause. This creates uncertainty about the contract's continuation beyond the Initial Term.",

Developer's total liability for damages under this agreement will not exceed the total amount paid to the developer.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the Developer is fully liable, without limitation, for damages. The modified clause introduces a limitation on the Developer's liability, capping it at the total amount paid. This directly contradicts the 'without limitation' aspect of the original clause, creating ambiguity about the extent of the Developer's financial responsibility.",

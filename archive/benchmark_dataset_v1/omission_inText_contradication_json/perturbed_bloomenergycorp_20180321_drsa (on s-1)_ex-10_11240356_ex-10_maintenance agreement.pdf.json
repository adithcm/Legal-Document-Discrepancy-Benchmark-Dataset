                "original_text": "Operator shall ensure that all operations and maintenance functions contemplated by this Section are performed by technically competent and qualified personnel (the “Service Technicians”). Operator shall ensure that all Service Technicians: (i) participate in a maintenance training program and receive confirmation of having achieved the requisite level of proficiency for the tasks they are assigned to perform, and (ii) attend periodic “refresher” training programs. The Operator shall at all times retain an operations manager who shall be dedicated to the overall supervision and management of performance of its obligations under this Agreement.",

The Operator shall at all times retain an operations manager who shall be dedicated to the overall supervision and management of performance of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirements regarding 'technically competent and qualified personnel' and the explicit need for Service Technicians to participate in maintenance and refresher training programs, an ambiguity is introduced. The contract does not guarantee competence. This contradicts the expectation set in other sections (e.g., Section 2.4) that the system will be serviced to meet Warranty Specifications, which implicitly requires trained and competent personnel.",

If such Power Performance Warranty calculation indicates that the Actual kWh of the Bloom Systems was less than the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period, then Operator shall so notify Owner in writing of the basis of its determination and Owner may make a claim under Section 2.5. An example of a Power Performance Warranty calculation for purposes of a Section 2.5 claim is attached as Appendix D.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the One-Year Power Performance Warranty Period, the contract creates an inconsistency. While Section 2.6 refers to both One-Month and One-Year periods for Power Performance Warranty, only the One-Month period is defined in the calculation. This makes the enforcement of the One-Year Power Performance Warranty ambiguous and unenforceable, as there's no clear process or period defined for it.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and that limitations of liability set forth in each such agreement are to be calculated on an aggregate basis taking into account all claims for indemnification, warranty or otherwise (if any) made under this Agreement and the MESPA.', the contract introduces ambiguity regarding how the limitations of liability are applied across both agreements. Other clauses specify the limitations of liability, but removing the explicit aggregation clause implies that the limitations might be applied separately for each agreement, potentially allowing for higher total claim amounts, thus creating a contradiction.",

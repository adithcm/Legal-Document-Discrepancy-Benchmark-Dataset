                "changed_text": "License Term\nCommencing: November 15, 2012",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific term (Perpetual or 2 years), and leaving only the commencement date, there is no clear license term defined. However, section 4 still refers to 'The License Term (which is identified in the Deal Terms)'. This creates an in-text contradiction because the Deal Terms no longer clearly define the License Term. This will lead to uncertainty about how long ConvergTV has rights to the Program.",

The Producer shall have thirty (30) days from the payment date to dispute the amount of any revenue share payout or any such claim or dispute is hereby waived by the Producer.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'The revenue share for the Program is stated in Exhibit B', the consideration is left undefined. However, later clauses still discuss revenue share payouts. This creates an internal contradiction as revenue share is referenced but no methodology or agreement is defined, potentially voiding this section of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'it shall comply with the Producer Performance Standards set forth in Exhibit C', and replacing it with a vague statement ('it shall strive for high quality productions'), the specific performance standards become undefined. However, this section refers to it as a warranty and states the Producer must follow it. However, the specifics are not defined, creating an uncertainty and contradiction regarding the warranted performance.",

                "changed_text": "1\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Agreement, the terms set forth in this clause, whether used in singular or plural form, shall mean, unless otherwise expressly\nprovided for in this Agreement or the context otherwise requires, the following:\n1.1\n“Affiliate” of a Party shall mean any entity the party deems as such.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of “Affiliate” provided a specific control-based definition. By changing it to “any entity the party deems as such,” it introduces ambiguity and potential for abuse. This undermines the intended legal precision of the term, specifically for matters involving financial liability and responsibility.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit references to European Commission Directive 2003/94/EC and the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, the definition loses its concrete grounding in established regulatory standards. Subsequent sections of the contract referring to cGMP compliance become ambiguous, as there's no clearly defined benchmark to measure against. This can affect the enforceability of quality standards.",

This section would be unforceable because it can't be checked if the modifications align with the original pricing.",

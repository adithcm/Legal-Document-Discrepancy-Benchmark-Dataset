Franchisor and Franchisee shall agree upon and decide the locations at which the Smaaash Centres shall be set up\nwithin the Territory.

                "explanation": "By removing the section where 'Franchisor and Franchisee shall agree upon and decide the locations at which the Smaaash Centres shall be set up within the Territory' creates a contradiction because this clause establishes a mutual agreement between both parties on the location. By omitting this, it gives the franchisor unilateral power. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes in future enforcements.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'the details of which are set out in Exhibit A to this Agreement', the contract still refers to trademarks and their use, but no specific trademarks are defined within the text itself. This lack of specificity creates an internal contradiction as the contract references trademarks without properly listing them, which can lead to disputes over what constitutes a licensed trademark. This impacts the enforcement of trademark rights.",

                "explanation": "By removing '(as provided in the operating manuals which shall be shared by Franchisor with Franchisee)' the reference to operating manuals is removed. The franchisee's compliance with franchisor standards is still mentioned, but without a clear reference to the operating manuals which the franchisor is supposed to share, it becomes unclear how standards are prescribed. This creates an internal contradiction, potentially making it difficult to enforce compliance due to lack of clarity.",

                "explanation": "By removing the Royalty Schedule, the contract becomes ambiguous about how the Royalty is calculated. Section 5.3(a) still references calculating royalties based on Subscriber information, however there is no Royalty Schedule to actually calculate royalty. This inconsistency makes the royalty clause unenforceable without further clarification.",

Because the definition of Affiliate has been removed, Licensee can argue the contract is unclear about who is considered an affiliate and thereby circumvent the intention of that Section. This will create ambiguity in enforcement, as it is not defined who is classified as an affiliate.",

                "explanation": "By changing the definition, Section 4.1(c) states 'Licensee shall present each Content Item solely in its entirety (without any addition, modification or deletion).' Because the definition of Licensed Content has been reduced to digital media, Licensor can argue there is no clause stating Licensee has to also present the images, code and content that were included. Thus, there is a contradiction that can cause issues in enforcement, because images, code and content are not specifically mentioned in the altered change to Licensed Content.",

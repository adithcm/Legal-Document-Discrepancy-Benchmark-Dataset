                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" relies on an undefined [***]. Replacing it with a general definition, while seemingly helpful, introduces ambiguity. Other clauses might reference the original definition expecting a specific interpretation tied to that missing term, creating a contradiction between intent and defined term.",

                "original_text": "1.151 “Valid Claim” means (a) a claim of any [***] Patent whose validity, enforceability, or patentability has not been rendered invalid by any of the following: (i) irretrievable lapse, abandonment, revocation, dedication to the public, or disclaimer; or (ii) a holding, finding, or decision of invalidity, unenforceability, or non-patentability by a court, governmental agency, national or regional patent office, or other appropriate body that has competent jurisdiction, such holding, finding, or decision being final and unappealable or unappealed within the time allowed for appeal, or (b) a claim in a Patent application that is filed and prosecuted in good faith and no more than [***] have lapsed from its earliest priority date. For clarity, (A) any claim in a Patent application, for which more than [***] have lapsed from its earliest priority date, shall not be considered a Valid Claim unless and until such claim is granted and meets the requirement of subclause (a) and (B) a holding, finding, or decision being final and unappealable or not appealed within the time allowed for appeal means a holding, finding, or decision from which no appeal (other than a petition to the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari or a similar appeal that is subject to discretionary review) can be or has been taken.",

                "explanation": "The original definition includes both granted patents and patent applications under certain conditions, with time limits tied to [***]. The modified definition removes all references to Patent applications and that time element and only includes granted patents that meet a strict criteria of never being challenged. Later sections on royalty payments or exclusivity might depend on the broader original definition of Valid Claim, making it now impossible to enforce the royalty rates or exclusivity as that is applicable to that broader definition, creating a contradiction.",

Notwithstanding the forgoing, if any adverse event safety data is received or otherwise generated by Harpoon following the License Option Exercise Closing Date and prior to the execution of such agreement, Harpoon shall, within [***] of receiving or otherwise generating such data, provide such data to AbbVie by email to: [***].",

The modified version removes those specifics, only broadly stating 'cooperation' and omitting AbbVie's defined responsibility to cover the costs of both. If other sections still reference the data-sharing agreement or cost allocation, an inconsistency would arise.",

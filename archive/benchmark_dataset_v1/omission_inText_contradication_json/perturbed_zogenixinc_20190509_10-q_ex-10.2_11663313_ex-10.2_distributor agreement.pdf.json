Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires that the applicable Party: (i) [***], (ii) [***], and (iii) [***].",
                "changed_text": "1.10 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means, with respect to a Party’s specific obligations under this Agreement, that level of efforts and resources deemed appropriate by the Party making the effort. ",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirements for 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts,' the definition becomes subjective. This creates uncertainty because the contract relies on this term for key obligations. If, for example, Zogenix fails to meet supply obligations, they could argue their efforts were 'commercially reasonable' under their own interpretation, even if objectively insufficient. This weakens the distributor's ability to enforce supply commitments.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the components that make up the Fully-Burdened Manufacturing Cost, this change will introduce ambiguities into calculating the transfer price and could cause disputes. With such ambiguity, Zogenix could inflate the costs, affecting distributor profits.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific deductions and accounting standard (Japan GAAP or IFRS) from the definition of Net Sales, this change introduces ambiguity. The contract references Net Sales for milestone payments and royalty calculations. 'Reasonable deductions' is subjective and opens the door for disputes over what can be deducted, creating uncertainty in enforcement and potentially reducing payments to Zogenix.",

                "explanation": "By removing the word “Minimum”, it implies that all investments and activities in the Commercialization plan are mandatory. This contrasts with other clauses that allow for flexibility and commercially reasonable efforts, potentially creating disputes over enforcement and compliance.",

                "explanation": "By removing key phrases in sections (a) and (b), this definition becomes ambiguous. Removing 'good faith efforts' from (a) introduces uncertainty about the required effort level. In section (b), removing consideration of the 'patent position' and 'anticipated profitability' undermines the concept of Commercialy Reasonable Efforts if profitability is not taken into account.",

                "explanation": "By removing “Minimum” and removing  'such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed', allows CytoDyn to refuse consent without providing any justification. This creates conflict with clauses that impose commercially reasonable efforts and good faith, which usually require justification for refusal, creating an enforcement contradiction.",

When paying by credit card, the Marketing Affiliate agrees to pay for all items that are revoked or disputed by the credit card company or the card holder along with any charges or fees charged by the credit card company including fees associated with processing the credit card transaction and that the Marketing Affiliate will be billed for those items in accordance with Equidata standard practices. Marketing Affiliate and the undersigned principal, partner or owner further agree that this Agreement will serve as a personal guaranty by the undersigned principal, partner or owner of the company, and the undersigned principal, partner or owner will become responsible for any unpaid balance past due on any invoice. The Marketing Affiliate agrees to pay a late charge of 1 l/2% per month on the unpaid, past-due amount as well as a returned check fee of not less than $35.00 per returned item. In addition, the Marketing Affiliate agrees to pay 25% attorney’s fees plus court cost in the event that the Marketing Affiliate’s account is referred to an attorney for collection.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause specifying late charges, returned check fees, and attorney's fees, there's no explicit definition of penalties for late payments, even though the initial statement indicates a commitment to pay promptly. This creates uncertainty because while prompt payment is expected, the consequences of not paying promptly are not defined. The absence of specified penalties creates ambiguity, weakening enforcement and potentially leading to disputes. Also, in section 9 of the agreement, there is a description of how attorney's fees will be handled, but the amount description here is removed.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the sentence, 'Equidata reserves the right to site inspect Marketing Affiliate’s physical location of business at any time.', it creates an omission of the scope of audits. The section still allows for audits, but there is no longer a definition of its scope. The contract maintains that Equidata can audit, but eliminates its inspection abilities. Since the scope is undefined, it weakens the power of the audits.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence, 'Further guidelines and requirements are provided in Exhibit B and C', we remove the explicit reference to Exhibits B and C, where compliance expectations and industry standards might be outlined. The Compliance (5) section mentions compliance, but removes the access to requirements, thus omitting a key component of what the standards are. This could create uncertainty about what the Marketing Affiliate must adhere to. This makes enforcing compliance harder, because it is unclear what the requirements are.",

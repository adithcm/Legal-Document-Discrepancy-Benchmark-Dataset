                "original_text": "The Blockchain Administrator agrees to maintain and keep all books, accounts and other records of the Fund that relate to activities performed by the Blockchain Administrator hereunder and will maintain and keep such books, accounts and records in accordance with the Investment Company Act. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the Investment Company Act, the Blockchain Administrator agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund shall at all times remain the property of the Fund, shall be readily accessible during normal business hours, and shall be promptly surrendered upon the termination of the Agreement or otherwise on written request. The Blockchain Administrator further agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act will be preserved for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act unless any such records are earlier surrendered as provided above. Records shall be surrendered in usable machine-readable form. The Blockchain Administrator shall have the right to retain copies of such records subject to observance of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.",

The Blockchain Administrator shall have the right to retain copies of such records subject to observance of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the stipulations about maintaining records in accordance with the Investment Company Act and specific rules (31a-1, 31a-2, 31a-3), while still requiring the Blockchain Administrator to maintain records, the contract creates ambiguity. There is no longer a clear standard for how the records should be maintained or how long they should be preserved, contradicting the original intent to comply with the Investment Company Act. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement related to record-keeping obligations.",

Such fee shall be accrued daily and paid monthly in arrears.",
                "changed_text": "(a) In full consideration of the provision of the services of the Blockchain Administrator set forth herein, the Fund shall pay the Blockchain Administrator a fee. Such fee shall be accrued daily and paid monthly.",
                "explanation": "By removing the rate of 0.20% and 'in arrears', the fee structure becomes ambiguous. While the contract still states a fee will be paid, there is no longer a specified calculation or payment schedule, leading to a contradiction in intent. Further contract sections depending on this annual rate are no longer applicable. There is now uncertainty regarding the actual amount to be paid and when the payments are due. This contradicts the expectation of a pre-agreed fee.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be amended by either party.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'pursuant to a written instrument by mutual consent of the parties' and replacing it with 'by either party' the contract introduces a contradiction. The original text clearly implies that amendments require a written agreement and the consent of both parties involved in the agreement. Changing the text to 'by either party' allows for unilateral amendments without needing mutual agreement or requiring that amendments be in writing. This creates uncertainty as to whether amendments are binding and enforceable if one party disagrees, contradicting the implied need for mutual consent.",

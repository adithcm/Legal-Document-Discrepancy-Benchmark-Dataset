                "original_text": "TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the “Term”); provided, however, that with respect to each Property, including Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and Ice Age II, all right and licenses granted herein will continue in full force and effect until March 31, 2008.",
                "changed_text": "TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire as defined in a subsequent addendum. With respect to some Properties, all rights and licenses granted herein will continue in full force and effect until a date determined by mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text defined a specific expiration date (March 31, 2008). The modified text introduces ambiguity by referring to a 'subsequent addendum' and 'mutual agreement' without specifying where or how these are determined. This creates uncertainty about the actual term length, especially concerning enforcement, and contradicts the ratified agreement.",

                "changed_text": "NOTICE PROVISION: The notice information for Licensee in Section 17(a) of the Agreement shall be amended such that “Paul Zuzelo” is deleted and replaced with “Legal Department”, without specifying an email or specific contact.",
                "explanation": "By changing the contact to 'Legal Department' and removing a specific email, the clarity of how to send official notices is significantly diminished. While the original section 17(a) might outline the responsibilities, the amendment creates an omission by failing to supply a viable communication endpoint, potentially causing delivery failures and impeding the contract's operational requirements.",

                "changed_text": "Except as herein expressly amended, the Agreement in all other respects is hereby generally ratified and shall continue in effect, contingent upon adherence to updated operational guidelines.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaced 'necessary implication modified' with a simple statement, removing an element of clarity. Critically, the phrasing \"contingent upon adherence to updated operational guidelines\" is too vague, creating ambiguity. Without referencing where these \"updated guidelines\" are, it introduces uncertainty about which version of the agreement has priority. This contradiction is significant because it muddles the responsibilities of the contracting parties.",

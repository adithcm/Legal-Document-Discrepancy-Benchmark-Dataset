                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(a) “Additional Title” shall have the meaning specified in Section 5.",
                "changed_text": "(a) “Additional Title” shall have the meaning defined by Licensee.",
                "explanation": "The original definition links to Section 5, providing a specific context. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by giving the Licensee unilateral control over the meaning of the term, potentially conflicting with other sections that might rely on a standard understanding of 'Additional Title'.",

The Reports and all information contained in the Reports shall be considered Confidential Information of Licensee, and all right, title and interest in and to such Reports and information shall be owned by Licensee.",
                "changed_text": "Reports will be delivered in a format determined solely by Licensee. The Reports and all information contained in the Reports shall be considered Confidential Information of Licensee, and all right, title and interest in and to such Reports and information shall be owned by Licensee.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for mutual agreement on the report format, the licensee now has unilateral control, which could contradict an implicit or explicit expectation of licensor input or access to specific data. This creates uncertainty about what data the licensor will receive, impacting their ability to monitor contract compliance.",
                "location": "Section 8(b)"

                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party breaches this Agreement. The definition of what constitutes a breach is determined by the terminating party.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'materially breaches' clause and the cure period, and giving the terminating party the unilateral right to define 'breach', the agreement introduces significant instability. This contradicts the intent of a fair contract, and the lack of a cure period disproportionately favors the terminating party, enabling termination for even minor infractions, undermining the overall agreement.",

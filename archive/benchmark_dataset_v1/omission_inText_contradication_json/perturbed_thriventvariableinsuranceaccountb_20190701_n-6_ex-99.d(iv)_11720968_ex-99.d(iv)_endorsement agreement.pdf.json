If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member’s fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'It will be based on each member’s fair share of the deficiency' the method of calculating the 'extra payment' is omitted, creating ambiguity. The contract still states an extra payment may be required, but the basis for calculation is removed, leading to uncertainty about how the 'fair share' would be determined. While the rest of the maintenance of solvency clause remains, the removal of this specific part undermines the clarity and enforceability of the entire clause, especially since the Board now determines if the payment is needed without a specific calculation method.",

                "explanation": "By removing '3) The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Society and all amendments to them. Benefits will not be reduced or eliminated by any future amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws,' from the definition of the 'Entire Contract', the contract now seemingly omits this critical document. This creates a contradiction because other sections of the document, such as the one about ASSIGNMENT, still refer to the bylaws. The contract asserts that benefits cannot be altered via future amendments to these documents, this is also removed, increasing uncertainty about contract stability.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'in accordance with our bylaws' the condition for assignment is removed from this sentence. As the bylaws define the specifics for transferring ownership, and the previous excerpt removed the bylaws from the definition of the 'entire contract', this creates uncertainty about how assignment can be executed. The contract mentions that assignment can occur, but there is no way to verify how this can occur, as the specific requirements are missing. It still references 'Society membership rights', but these right are defined in the bylaws, creating an issue.",

                "original_text": "Net Sales means the total of the gross invoice prices of Licensed Products sold or leased by the Licensee, an Affiliate, a Distributor, or any combination thereof, less the sum of the following actual and customary deductions where applicable and separately listed: cash, trade, or quantity discounts; sales, use, tariff, import/export duties or other excise taxes imposed on particular sales (in particular value-added tax); transportation charges; or credits to customers because of rejections or returns. For purposes of calculating Net Sales, transfers to an Affiliate or to a Distributor of Licensed Product under this Agreement for (i) end use (but not resale) by the Affiliate shall be treated as sales by Licensee at the list price of the Licensee in an arm-length transaction, or (ii) resale by an Affiliate shall be treated as sales at the list price of the Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "Net Sales means the total of the gross invoice prices of Licensed Products sold or leased by the Licensee, an Affiliate, a Distributor, or any combination thereof. For purposes of calculating Net Sales, transfers to an Affiliate or to a Distributor of Licensed Product under this Agreement shall be treated as sales by Licensee.",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed list of deductions from gross invoice prices, the definition of 'Net Sales' becomes vague and open to interpretation. This creates a contradiction with the later clauses (like 3.3 Royalties) which rely on a precise calculation of Net Sales for determining royalty payments. It is now unclear which deductions are permissible, potentially leading to disputes over royalty amounts.",

                "changed_text": "Appendix A - [Template for Licensee Reports]",
                "explanation": "By removing '– to be provided by NLS to Eurofarma within 60 days following the effective date of signature of the Agreement', it becomes uncertain when and if Appendix A will be provided. This contradicts Article 3.4 (Reports) which refers to Appendix A as the form for submitting reports. If Appendix A is not provided, the licensee lacks the template, creating uncertainty.",

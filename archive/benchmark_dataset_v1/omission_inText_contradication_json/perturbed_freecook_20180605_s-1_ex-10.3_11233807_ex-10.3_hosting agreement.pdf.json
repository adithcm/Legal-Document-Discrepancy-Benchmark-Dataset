Client agrees to pay to Company the sum of $5,000 (the “Contract Price”) to design and develop a website for Client (the “Client Website”) in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.\n(a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a “Change Order”. The costs of any such changes shall be added to the Contract Price. Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",

Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement must be submitted to and accepted by Company. Additional Work shall be defined as revisions of pages or features.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit attachment of Exhibit A (Scope of Work), but still referencing the 'Scope of Work' in sections 1 and 1(a), we create an internal contradiction. The contract states the website will be developed according to the 'Scope of Work,' but there is no clearly defined scope of work readily accessible within the document, and the requirements for approval are not as detailed. This omission makes the basis of the agreement unclear and unenforceable, especially regarding how changes are agreed upon and costed.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'on completion of the Scope of Work' we introduce ambiguity. While the initial total payment remains the same, the trigger for the final payment is now undefined. This contradicts the initial agreement where payment was tied to work completion. The client could argue there is no obligation to pay the final payment.",

Any email or telephone correspondence received after normal business hours will be processed the following business day. Client shall pay an additional surcharge for any services requiring work to be performed outside of normal business hours by reason of a rush deadline requested by Client or as a result of Client’s failure to meet scheduled times for delivery and/or review and approval of information, content and materials. The surcharge for rush work shall be the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%).",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specific amount of the surcharge (standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent), the contract still stipulates that the client must pay a surcharge for rush work, but fails to state how that surcharge is calculated. This creates ambiguity and makes this requirement difficult to enforce.",

STAAR may from time to time modify or change the Products on Exhibit A-1 in its sole discretion, and if so, will notify Distributor promptly thereof. In the event that STAAR discontinues a Product, it will provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Distributor.

The Minimum Purchase Quantities for the Contract Year are as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto. Within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of each Contract Year, the parties will discuss in good faith and agree on the Minimum Product Quantities for the successive Contract Year; provided, however, that, if the parties fail to reach agreement on or otherwise specify the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the successive Contract Year, the Minimum Product Quantities for such successive Contract Year shall be __________ percent (___%) of the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the existing Contract Year. “Contract Year” means for the first Contract Year of the Agreement, the period commencing on the Effective Date hereof and ending one year thereafter and for subsequent Contract Years, the successive twelve (12) month period thereafter. Failure of Distributor to purchase the Minimum Purchase Quantities for any Contract Year, shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The removal of \"The Minimum Purchase Quantities for the Contract Year are as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto.\" creates a contradiction because the contract mentions Minimum Product Quantities but removes the reference to Exhibit B, which specifies them. Without Exhibit B, the Minimum Product Quantities are undefined, making enforcement of this clause uncertain.",

On a separate endorsement, Distributor shall name STAAR as an additional named insured. Such separate endorsement shall indicate that Distributor’s insurance is primary and that STAAR’s coverage as an additional named insured is not contributory. Each such insurance policy and endorsement shall provide that the insurance will not be canceled or reduces without at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to STAAR. On request, Distributor shall provide STAAR with copies or certificates of all such insurance policies.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific minimum coverage amounts (US$2 million per occurrence, US$5 million in the aggregate) and the requirements for naming STAAR as an additional insured, this section becomes vague. While the distributor is still obligated to maintain coverage, the lack of specific limits creates uncertainty and makes it difficult to determine if the distributor is in compliance. This contradicts the original intent of providing STAAR with financial protection through specific coverage requirements.",

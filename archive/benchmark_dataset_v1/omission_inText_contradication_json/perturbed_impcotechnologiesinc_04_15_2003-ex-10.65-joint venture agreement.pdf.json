                "original_text": "“Affiliate(s)” shall mean with respect to any Party to this Agreement any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Party. An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it controls, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.",
                "changed_text": "“Affiliate(s)” shall mean with respect to any Party to this Agreement any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Party. An entity controls another entity when it influences decisions.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a clear threshold for control (51% ownership or control of the board). The modified definition replaces this with the ambiguous term 'influences decisions,' which lacks a clear metric and could lead to disputes over what constitutes control, especially in later clauses dealing with share transfers or non-compete agreements that hinge on affiliate status.",

                "changed_text": "3.3   Unless otherwise agreed, between the Parties, the Board of Directors of the JVC shall consist of not less than five (5) and not more than twelve (12) Directors, including the Managing Director (MD). Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the representation of MIL/MINDA and IMPCO on the Board of the JVC shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific ratio of director nomination (3:2 in favor of IMPCO) and the statement about IMPCO always maintaining a majority, this change creates uncertainty. Later clauses may rely on IMPCO having a guaranteed majority, and this omission makes that assumption invalid. It also contradicts the agreement about the first four directors being nominated by IMPCO because there are no rules for the future representation to maintain the ratio.",

                "changed_text": "16.4   If the JVC's performance is unsatisfactory, both the Parties will mutually discuss whether to continue or terminate the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a concrete metric for evaluating the JVC's performance (sales of $1,000,000 within 18 months). Removing this metric and replacing it with 'unsatisfactory' makes the clause highly subjective. This creates an in-text contradiction if other sections of the agreement reference this clause as a trigger for termination, but the actual definition of 'unsatisfactory' is missing.",

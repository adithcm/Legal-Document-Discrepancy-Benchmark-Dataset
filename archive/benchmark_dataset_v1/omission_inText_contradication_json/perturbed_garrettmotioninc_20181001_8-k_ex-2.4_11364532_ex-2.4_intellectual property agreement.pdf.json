                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Trade Secrets' provides a detailed description, including the requirement that the owner takes 'reasonable measures to keep such information secret' and that the information derives 'independent economic value'. The modified definition replaces this with a vague term 'proprietary business information'. This omission creates uncertainty because it's unclear what constitutes 'proprietary business information' or how 'secret' it needs to be and if the secrets are required to provide any economic value. This ambiguity affects the enforceability of clauses that reference 'Trade Secrets'.",

The Parties acknowledge that through the course of a history of integrated operations SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group have each obtained knowledge of and access to, or otherwise used, certain Honeywell IP, including Patents, Trade Secrets, copyrighted content, proprietary know-how, and other Intellectual Property Rights that are not otherwise governed expressly by the Separation Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or identified expressly in the schedules thereto (collectively, “Honeywell Shared IP”). With regard to the Honeywell Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that SpinCo has the freedom to use such Honeywell Shared IP in the future. Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for “have-made” purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof,' the modification creates ambiguity regarding the scope of the license granted to SpinCo. The original clause limited the usage to the existing scope of SpinCo's business before the distribution date. Without this limitation, it's unclear if SpinCo can use the licensed IP for completely new ventures unrelated to its original business. This affects the enforcement because it allows for different interpretation of the license, particularly if SpinCo expands its business significantly after distribution.",

In the event that either Party, acting reasonably, forms the view that another Party has caused a material breach of the terms of this Agreement, then the Party that forms such a view shall serve written notice of the alleged breach on the other Parties and the Parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any such alleged breach within thirty (30) days of such notice (a “Dispute”). If any such alleged breach is not so resolved, then a senior executive of each Party shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such alleged breach within the following thirty (30) days of the referral of the matter to the senior executives. If no resolution is reached with respect to any such alleged breach in accordance with the procedures contained in this Section 11.02, then the Parties may seek to resolve such matter in accordance with Section 11.03, Section 11.04 and Section 11.06",

                "explanation": "The removal of \"acting reasonably\" and \"in good faith\" significantly alters the intent of the dispute resolution process. By omitting \"acting reasonably\" it opens the door for frivolous or malicious claims, since a party need not have a sound basis for alleging a breach. Similarly, removing \"in good faith\" from both sentences allows parties to engage in purely strategic or obstructive behavior during resolution attempts, undermining the process's goal of amicable settlement. This change introduces uncertainty in enforcement because it's unclear what standard of conduct is expected from each party, making it difficult to determine if they've properly followed the dispute resolution procedure before escalating the issue.",

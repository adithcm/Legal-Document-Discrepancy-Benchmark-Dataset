Later sections referring to the specifications in Schedule “1” will create confusion as the specifications are no longer explicitly tied to the definition of the core product.",

Ehave shall also provide CHT written notice and detail of any deficiencies that Ehave’s auditors (whether internal or external) found through the conduct of such audits and the remediation efforts that Ehave shall undergo to rectify such deficiencies. Ehave shall promptly rectify any deficiencies identified that may materially and adversely impact the Ehave Companion Solution or End User Data, and shall provide CHT with such information as CHT may reasonably request from time to time with respect to its security controls including any remediation efforts undertaken to rectify any deficiencies.",

                "explanation": "By removing specific details about the audit type (SSAE No. 18, SOC 2) and the materiality threshold for rectifying deficiencies, the obligation becomes ambiguous. The change affects 'promptly rectify any deficiencies identified that may materially and adversely impact'. This omission can contradict later sections that might assume a specific audit standard and a clear materiality definition, leading to disputes about compliance and enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'standard About header, footer, tabs, navigational elements, copyright notice and other attributes set forth in EXHIBIT A', and not removing it from sections 3.2 and 4.1, the definition of ABOUT WRAPPER becomes vague. If sections 3.2 and 4.1 reference EXHIBIT A, yet the definition above does not, an internal contradiction is created. This leads to uncertainty on what constitutes the \"About Wrapper\" and its components.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'contained in an About Wrapper' from section 3.2, it now contradicts the definition of \"Insurance Center\" in section 1, as well as the altered definition of “About Wrapper”. The definition of the “Insurance Center” still states that (i) the About Marks and About Wrapper appear. Now, the removal from this section removes this requirement, creating internal inconsistency.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'in the form and manner set forth on EXHIBIT G', but continuing to mention the 'Impressions', creates ambiguity. Without EXHIBIT G, the form and manner of these advertising impressions are undefined, which creates contradictions with other clauses that may refer to specific attributes described in the exhibit. For example, if another section discusses the size or placement of these impressions based on EXHIBIT G, the lack of it will cause conflicts.",

                "original_text": "Individual agrees that, during the Term hereof, she will not render similar services for, or permit the use of her name, nickname, likeness, voice, live or recorded performance, photograph, signature or facsimile thereof, and biographical materials in advertising or publicizing in any medium for any other Kefir product, yogurt product, cheese, frozen desserts and other products that compete with products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies other than those products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and parent companies.",
                "changed_text": "Individual agrees that, during the Term hereof, she will not render similar services for, or permit the use of her name in advertising or publicizing in any medium for any other Kefir product.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the specific prohibition against working with competitors for yogurt products, cheese, frozen desserts, and other competing products beyond Kefir. This creates an ambiguity because Section 6 still refers to 'products that compete with products manufactured or distributed by Lifeway', however the definition is significantly narrowed here, making enforcement unclear.",

                "original_text": "In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway agrees\nto pay Individual a royalty (the \"Royalty\") equal to $0.02 for each Lifeway product or\nindividual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing\nIndividual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics;\nprovided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000\nin any month. All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or\nto the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after\nthe end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific royalty rate ($0.02 per item) and the monthly cap ($50,000), the contract now states that a royalty will be paid but provides no method of calculating the amount. This makes the clause unenforceable as the actual compensation is undefined, leading to uncertainty even though 'Royalty' is still defined and referenced.",

                "explanation": "By omitting clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 10, the agreement now lacks specific guidance on how confidential information can be used or reproduced. While there's still a general confidentiality obligation, the removal creates uncertainty as to whether the recipient is permitted to use confidential information at all, even to perform obligations under the agreement, or reproduce it. This contradicts the implicit understanding that the agreement requires the use of some information.",

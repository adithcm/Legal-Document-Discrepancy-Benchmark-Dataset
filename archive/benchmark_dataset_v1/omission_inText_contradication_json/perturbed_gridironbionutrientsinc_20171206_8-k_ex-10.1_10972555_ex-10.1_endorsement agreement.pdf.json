                "explanation": "The phrase \"unless terminated sooner\" has been removed from the definition of 'Contract Period'. Later sections of the contract, such as Section 9 (DEFAULT) and Section 10 (USE OF THE NFLA/NFLA-NC’s IDENTIFICATION AFTER TERMINATION), still refer to termination of the contract. However, by removing 'unless terminated sooner', the definition of 'Contract Period' implies that the contract will last for three years regardless of any default or termination events. This creates an internal contradiction, as the contract both allows for termination and defines a contract period that seems inflexible, leading to uncertainty in enforcement of termination clauses.",

                "explanation": "The phrase \"for the term of this Agreement. Where the following per Unit conversion shall apply for the term of this Agreement:\" has been removed from this section. Section 4(C) describes a donation of $0.05 per unit sold of Licensed Products. The subsequent sections (a-f) define what constitutes 'one unit' for each product. By removing the phrase referring to per unit conversion, the contract now specifies a donation per unit, but lacks clarity on how to calculate the 'unit' for each product throughout the agreement term. This creates confusion and an internal contradiction, making the remuneration clause difficult to enforce precisely and consistently.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"good faith effort\" from this section, the change could inadvertently require the NFLA-NC to provide services whether or not they can or want to do so, and would be contradictory to the nature of 'good faith'. Without the 'good faith' qualifier, the clause is open to interpretation on the exact level of effort needed and will create uncertainty, and can potentially be used to hold the NFLA-NC in dereliction of the contract if the company is not satisfied.",

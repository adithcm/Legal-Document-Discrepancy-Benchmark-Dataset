                "changed_text": "“KIB Product IP” means any idea associated with the KIB Product. The specifics of Intellectual Property rights related to the KIB Product are detailed in Appendix B.",
                "explanation": "The original text defined KIB Product IP with explicit exclusions. The modified text simplifies the definition, making it vague and replaces the specific exclusions with a reference to 'Appendix B'. If 'Appendix B' doesn't exist or doesn't clearly define the IP rights, it will creates uncertainty and contradiction, especially if other sections still refer to the original definition's exclusions.",

Stryker shall pay to Conformis the following milestone payments for the development\nwork to be conducted hereunder if and when the following milestones are met, as follows:\n(a) Milestone #1 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which Stryker receives the first prototype of the Patient-\nSpecific Instrumentation delivered to it by Conformis in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a\ntotal of two million U.S. dollars ($2,000,000); and\n(b) Milestone #2 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which there is a design freeze of the Patient-Specific\nInstrumentation for the KIB Product in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a total of three\nmillion U.S dollars ($3,000,000).",

Stryker shall pay to Conformis milestone payments for the development work to be conducted hereunder if and when the milestones are met, as follows:\n(a) Milestone #1 - Upon delivery of the first prototype, Stryker shall pay Conformis a certain amount; and\n(b) Milestone #2 - Upon design freeze, Stryker shall pay Conformis another amount.",
                "explanation": "By removing the payment amounts and the specific timeframe of 'Within thirty (30) days', the modified text creates uncertainty. The original text clearly defined the payment terms, while the change makes it ambiguous, especially if the total payment amount is mentioned elsewhere in the agreement without being defined in this crucial section. This contradiction would make enforcement difficult.",

                "explanation": "The original text had a detailed clause defining 'Insolvency Event' and outlining exceptions related to Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The modified text simplifies it to 'significant financial difficulty,' a vague term. This creates a contradiction because other sections might still refer to the specific criteria of the original 'Insolvency Event' definition, while the termination clause now operates on a subjective assessment of 'significant financial difficulty.' This makes the termination clause open to interpretation and disputes.",

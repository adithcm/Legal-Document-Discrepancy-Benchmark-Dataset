            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A.  Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A.  Guarantors shall ensure payments are made. Specific payment schedules are subject to change with written notice from the Franchisor.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that the guarantors will pay all monies according to the Master Franchise Agreement's schedule. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the schedule can change with notice, potentially contradicting the guarantor's understanding of their fixed obligations as per the original agreement. This creates ambiguity and an internal contradiction, as the rest of the agreement still refers to a definitive payment obligation.",
                "location": "Section A"

            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "B. Guarantors shall unconditionally guarantee full performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of all the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement at the times and in the manner therein provided.",
                "changed_text": "B. Guarantors shall guarantee reasonable efforts towards performance by Master Franchisee of obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause sets an 'unconditional guarantee' for full performance. The modified text changes this to a guarantee of 'reasonable efforts,' significantly weakening the obligation. This is a contradiction because other clauses in the document still assume an unconditional guarantee, leading to uncertainty about the guarantor's actual responsibilities.",
                "location": "Section B"
            },
            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated. In the event of any conflict of law, the laws of such state shall prevail, without regard to the application of such state’s conflict of law rules. If, however, any provision of this Guarantee would not be enforceable under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and if the Master Franchisee’s franchised business is located outside of such state and such provision would be enforceable under the laws of the state in which the Master Franchisee’s franchised business is located, then such provision shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of that state. Any action brought to enforce or interpret this Guarantee in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the county and state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and Guarantors hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
                "changed_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted under principles of fairness and equity. The parties agree to mediate any disputes before resorting to litigation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a specific and detailed choice of law and venue. The modified clause replaces this with a vague reference to 'fairness and equity' and mandates mediation. This directly contradicts the original clause, creating uncertainty about which legal standards and procedures will govern the agreement's interpretation and enforcement. The waiver of jurisdiction is also removed, introducing further ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "“Advertising Revenue Share” has the meaning assigned to it in Section 7.1.\n \n“Advertising Services” means the advertising and promotional services (including the Digital Content Service, the Digital Carousel, the\nTraditional Content Program, Lobby Promotions and Event Sponsorships) as described in Part A of Exhibit A.",
                "changed_text": "“Advertising Revenue Share” means a percentage of advertising revenue, as determined by NCM.\n \n“Advertising Services” means various promotional activities, including on-screen advertising and lobby promotions. Further details regarding specific Advertising Services may be provided separately.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly links 'Advertising Revenue Share' to Section 7.1, which provides a specific formula. The modified text removes this clear link and replaces it with a vague description, making the calculation of Advertising Revenue Share arbitrary and at the discretion of NCM. Furthermore, 'Advertising Services' has been modified so it does not reference Exhibit A and the definition is much more vague.",

On or before sixty (60) days after the end of each month during the Term, NCM shall pay to \nNetwork Affiliate $30.00 per digitized screen (i.e., a screen connected to the Digital Content Network), provided Network Affiliate provides the \nrequired attendance and screen count information as such information time frames are established by NCM on a monthly basis.",
                "changed_text": "Section 7.1 Access Fee \n \n(a) Digital Screen Usage Fee. NCM shall pay Network Affiliate a fee per digitized screen (i.e., a screen connected to the Digital Content Network), as NCM deems appropriate. This fee will be determined based on metrics that NCM deems relevant.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a payment of '$30.00 per digitized screen'. The modified text removes the specific amount and introduces ambiguity ('as NCM deems appropriate', 'based on metrics that NCM deems relevant'). This creates an omission of a critical payment term. This directly contradicts the earlier definition and weakens the Affiliate's revenue rights.",

                "original_text": "Any disputes between the Parties relating to the calculation of amounts owed\nshall be referred to a mutually satisfactory independent public accounting firm that has not been employed by either party for the two (2) year\nperiod immediately preceding the date of such referral. The determination of such firm shall be conclusive and binding on each party, and\njudgment upon any such determination can be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the matter. Each Party shall bear one-half of the fees of\nsuch firm. If the Parties cannot select such accounting firm, then the selection of such accounting firm shall be made by the American Arbitration\nAssociation located in Denver, Colorado. In addition to the foregoing audit rights of the parties, during the Term, NCM and its authorized agents\nshall have the right, upon reasonable advance notice, to inspect any Network Affiliate premises or facilities involved in the performance of this\nAgreement to confirm the performance and satisfaction of Network Affiliate’s obligations hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "Any disputes between the Parties relating to the calculation of amounts owed shall be subject to the sole discretion of NCM management. In addition to the foregoing audit rights of the parties, during the Term, NCM and its authorized agents shall have the right, upon reasonable advance notice, to inspect any Network Affiliate premises or facilities involved in the performance of this Agreement to confirm the performance and satisfaction of Network Affiliate’s obligations hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a structured dispute resolution mechanism involving an independent accounting firm and the American Arbitration Association. The modified clause eliminates this entire mechanism and replaces it with 'sole discretion of NCM management'. This creates an internal contradiction because earlier sections outline obligations and potential payments, implying a fair and transparent process, but this clause subverts that by giving NCM unilateral control over dispute resolution.",

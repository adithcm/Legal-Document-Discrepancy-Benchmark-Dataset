During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2017, and for the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] Units (the twelve-month periods and the six month period are each a “Contract Period”).",

                "explanation": "By stating there will be no minimum for the last six months but not removing the definition of 'Contract Period' including the last six months, there is confusion as to whether that six-month period is still considered a 'Contract Period' and what the MAOV implications are for the agreement as a whole. This contradicts the general intention of an annual minimum order.",

However, Heritage and Jasper are required to follow laws and regulations applicable, including those set by the FDA and PHS, creating a contradiction where the extent to which these third party regulations and Premier standards/expectations must be adhered to is ambiguous.",

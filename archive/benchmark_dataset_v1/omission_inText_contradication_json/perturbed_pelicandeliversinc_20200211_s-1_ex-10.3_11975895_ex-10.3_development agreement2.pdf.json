Any Change\nRequest shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence\nof a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",

In the absence\nof a specific notification from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit definition of 'Change Request,' the modified text creates ambiguity. While the contract still mentions the need for the client to communicate issues, it doesn't define how a formal 'Change Request' should look. This weakens the enforcement since the developer can argue that a vague email, for example, doesn't constitute a formal rejection and therefore the deliverable is accepted. This creates a contradiction as later sections assume a formal Change Request process, which is not clearly defined here.",

                "explanation": "By removing the Developer's bank account details, Section 5.4 becomes unenforceable. While the section states that the client will pay via wire, the lack of specific banking information makes the process impossible to complete. This omission creates a contradiction as the contract dictates a mode of payment without providing the necessary instructions for said payment, which would result in breach of contract as Section 5.2 suggests any failure to pay due amounts will be a material breach.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit definition of 'disparage,' the clause becomes open to interpretation. The section initially clarified what constituted disparagement (any negative statement about specific entities). Without this definition, the clause is weakened. The contract still relies on that definition in its entirety for determining if there's been any violations of the non-disparagement clause. This presents a conflict because of its absence, and any interpretation of disparagement might become highly subjective, creating uncertainty in enforcing this provision.",

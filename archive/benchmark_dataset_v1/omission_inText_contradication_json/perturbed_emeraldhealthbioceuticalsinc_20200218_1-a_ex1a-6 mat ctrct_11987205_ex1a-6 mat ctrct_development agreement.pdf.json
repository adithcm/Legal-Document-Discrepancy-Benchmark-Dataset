                "explanation": "By removing the royalty rate table, the contract still states that Dr. Murray is to receive royalty payments, but the exact amount is no longer specified.

                "explanation": "Removing the explicit listing of which sections survive termination (e.g., Sections 2.1, 3.1, etc.) creates an internal contradiction. Other sections of the contract may rely on the continued existence of those rights and obligations. The phrases 'certain rights and obligations' and 'certain sections' are ambiguous.",

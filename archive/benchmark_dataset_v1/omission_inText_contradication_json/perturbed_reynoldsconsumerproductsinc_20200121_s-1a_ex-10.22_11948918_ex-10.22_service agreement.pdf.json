                "original_text": "Section 3.1 Quality of Services.\n(a) Provider shall perform the Services (i) at a level of quality substantially similar in all material respects to that at which such Services were\nperformed or enjoyed during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof and (ii) in accordance with applicable Law (collectively, (i) and\n(ii), the “Service Standard”). Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard shall\nremain materially the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and their Affiliates are\nnot professional service providers of the Services.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3.1 Quality of Services.\n(a) Provider shall perform the Services at a reasonable level of quality. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and their Affiliates are not professional service providers of the Services.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Service Standard', which is defined as 'level of quality substantially similar to that at which such Services were performed during the twelve month period prior to the date hereof and in accordance with applicable Law', and replacing it with 'reasonable level of quality,' the contract now lacks a clear benchmark for evaluating service performance. This creates a contradiction because other sections, such as Section 3.1(c), still reference the 'Service Standard,' but that standard is no longer precisely defined, making enforcement ambiguous.",

Recipient shall pay Provider (i) the fee for each Service set forth on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, (ii) Providers’ and their Affiliates’ reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the Services, including the third-party fees and expenses that are charged to Recipient or their Affiliates in connection with provision of the Services (including any fees and expenses charged by subcontractors permitted to provide the Services under Section 2.2) but excluding payments made to employees of Provider or any of their Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.2, and (iii) any other fees as agreed to by the Parties in writing (collectively, the “Fees”).",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly references exhibits A and B for fee schedules. By deleting this, and only stating the recipient will pay the fees, and that it is up to the provider to deem appropriate, the contract now contradicts the existence of Exhibits A and B and lacks a clear method to calulcate the costs. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement.",

Upon termination of any Service pursuant to this Section 6.2, the Terminating Party’s obligation",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly references the exhibit G1, section A, and its conditions for termination of services, and its mention of a migration plan. By deleting this exception, the contract now has internal ambiguity in enforcement and conditions for the termination of the service. This creates a contradiction because Section G1 is still referenced in other sections of this file.",

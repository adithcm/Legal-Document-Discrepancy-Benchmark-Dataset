                "explanation": "By removing \"and future products, including without limitation those listed on Exhibit D, including any improvements thereto,\" the definition now excludes future products and improvements. This could contradict other sections referring to development of future products or Sekisui's rights related to them.",

Sekisui shall submit to Qualigen by the fifth day of each calendar month a rolling twelve (12) month (month-by-month) forecast of the quantity of each Product that Sekisui anticipates selling during the following twelve (12) months (the “Forecast”). As to Reagent Kits each respective Forecast shall represent reasonable estimates to be used for planning and inventory stocking purposes as indicated in Exhibit D, and shall not be binding on Sekisui; provided, however, that as to Instruments the quantities for each of the first three months of each respective Forecast shall be deemed to constitute and shall constitute firm, binding orders for such quantities of Instruments in such respective months (but in no event for a lesser quantity for a month than the quantity for such month which, pursuant to an earlier Forecast, had already become a firm, binding order).",

                "explanation": "By removing the stipulation that the first three months’ forecast for Instruments are binding orders, it creates a contradiction with any potential sections that assume committed orders based on initial forecasts.",

In addition to the payments for the purchase of Products set forth in Section 4.1 above, in connection with this Agreement and in furtherance of the Development Plan, Sekisui shall provide to Qualigen up to $6,200,000 of financing in accordance with the timing and other provisions of the Development Plan and the achievement of the applicable milestones set forth therein (the “Financing Payments”). All such Financing Payments shall be used in accordance with the Development Plan and shall be non-refundable once paid, other than as set off in connection with a Sale Transaction as further described below. Time is of the essence for the payment by Sekisui of the resulting Financing Payments upon confirmation of achievement by Qualigen of the respective Development Plan milestones as set forth in Section 6.2 and the Development Plan.",

In addition to the payments for the purchase of Products set forth in Section 4.1 above, in connection with this Agreement and in furtherance of the Development Plan, Sekisui may provide financing to Qualigen. All such Financing Payments shall be used in accordance with the Development Plan and shall be non-refundable once paid, other than as set off in connection with a Sale Transaction as further described below.",
                "explanation": "By removing the mandatory $6,200,000 financing obligation and associated clauses, the modification makes the financing discretionary. However, other sections may still rely on the assumption that Sekisui is obligated to provide the full $6,200,000, creating ambiguity and potential breach of contract.",

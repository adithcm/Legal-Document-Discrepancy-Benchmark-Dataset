Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), non-assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world only in the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in the form set forth on Schedule 6.1.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), non-assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for use in the Company Field throughout the world. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity of the brand.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the 'Arizona Trademark License Term' and 'form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in the form set forth on Schedule 6.1', the duration and usage guidelines for the trademark license become ambiguous. Although the license is granted for use in the Company Field, the absence of a specific term and specific direction introduces uncertainty in enforcement and contradicts the original intent of limiting the license duration. The 'Arizona Trademark License Term' is not defined in the changed text, and Schedule 6.1 details specific design requirements to the logo, therefore, omitting it leads to a contradiction. This could lead to disputes over the permissible duration and form of trademark usage.",

Schedule 1.1(b) originally contains a specific list of domain names, and that the domain names should be used exclusively in the Company Field, but by removing the schedule and the restriction, the scope now becomes unclear, creating a conflict with the original scope. It can be misinterpreted to include domain names not intended to be assigned, potentially leading to disputes over ownership and usage rights.",

                "explanation": "The clause on `Presentation of Arizona Licensed Trademarks` provides details on how and when trademarks can be used. Removing the paragraph on Armstrong Logo Usage creates an inconsistency with the text referencing the license of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks. If the company is expected to maintain standards with Arizona Licensed Trademarks, but there are no instructions on what those standards are, there is an in-text contradiction.",

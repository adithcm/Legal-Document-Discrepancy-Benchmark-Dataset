                "explanation": "The original text mandates the collection of 'National Advertising Fund Contribution', removing phrases such as 'to be contributed to our National Advertising Fund pursuant to the terms of the individual Unit Franchise Agreements.' as well as 'spent by you in accordance with the agreement on behalf of the franchisor and Franchisees.' This removes the obligation, and the section referencing what this contribution is for. This creates ambiguity and internal contradiction with other sections that might still reference mandatory advertising contributions.",

                "original_text": "5.5\tInsurance\n\nDuring the term of this Agreement, you shall maintain in force under policies of insurance issued by licensed insurers approved by us insurance coverage as we from time to time require. You must maintain insurance related to your operation of the Franchised Business. Such insurance coverage will include:\n\n5.5.1\tAs it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: broad form comprehensive general liability coverage against claims for employment practices coverage, bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the conduct of business by you pursuant to this Agreement and broad form contractual liability coverage, including errors and omissions coverage, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage prescribed by us from time to time, but in no event in an amount less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) aggregate. Such insurance shall not have a deductible or self-insured retention in excess of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000);\n\n5.5.2\tAs it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: automobile liability insurance coverage, including owned and non-owned vehicles, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence;\n\n5.5.3\tAs it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: worker’s compensation and employer’s liability insurance in statutory amounts, unemployment insurance and state disability insurance as required by governing law for your employees;\n\n5.5.4\tAs it relates to the Unit Franchisees’ operation in the Master Territory, and if you elect to obtain such coverage: general liability insurance, which insurance is in addition to any general liability insurance the Unit Franchisees are required to maintain under their Unit Franchise Agreements.\n\nYou shall also maintain such additional insurance as is necessary to comply with all legal requirements concerning insurance. We may periodically increase the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance at any time including excess liability insurance to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in law or standards of liability, higher damage awards, or other relevant changes in circumstances.\n\nThe insurance policies required herein shall: (a) name us as an additional named insured and contain a waiver of all subrogation rights against us, our affiliates, and our and their successors and assigns; (b) provide for thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to us of any material modification, cancellation, or expiration of such policy; (c) provide that the coverage applies separately to each insured against whom a claim is brought as though a separate policy had been issued to each insured; (d) contain no provision which in any way limits or reduces coverage for you in the event of a claim by any one or more of the parties indemnified under this Agreement; (e) be primary to and without right of contribution from any other insurance purchased by the parties indemnified under this Agreement; and (f) extend to and provide indemnity for all obligations assumed by you hereunder and all other items for which you are required to indemnify us under this Agreement.\n\nYou shall provide us with evidence of the insurance required hereunder not later than ten (10) days before you begin operating as a Master Franchisee, and with a complete copy of each insurance policy no more than thirty (30) days after delivery of the original proof of insurance. Thereafter, prior to the expiration of the term of each insurance policy, you shall furnish us with a copy of each renewal or replacement insurance policy to be maintained by you for the immediately following term and evidence of the payment of the premium therefor. Should you, for any reason, fail to procure or maintain the insurance required by this Agreement, as such requirements may be revised from time to time by us in writing, we shall have the right and authority (without, however, any obligation to do so) immediately to procure such insurance and to charge same to you, which charges shall be payable by you immediately upon notice together with a ten percent (10%) administrative fee. The foregoing remedies shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity.\n\nThe maintenance of sufficient insurance coverage shall be your responsibility. Your obligations to maintain insurance coverage as herein described shall not be affected in any manner by reason of any separate insurance maintained by us nor shall the maintenance of such insurance relieve you of any indemnification obligations under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By omitting detailed requirements for insurance coverage, including the specific types of coverage, minimum liability amounts, and policy provisions, the modified text creates ambiguity and potential conflicts. Removing key clauses such as those mandating additional insured status for the franchisor and waivers of subrogation rights makes the clause unenforceable. The phrase 'may include' does not guarantee coverage of all the key items of the original sections.",

To facilitate such resolution, Franchisor and Franchisee agree that each party shall submit the dispute between them for non-binding mediation at a mutually agreeable location before commencing litigation proceedings If Franchisor and Franchisee cannot agree on a location, the mediation will be conducted in Staten Island, New York. The mediation will be conducted by one (1) mediator who is appointed under the American Arbitration Association’s Commercial Mediation Rules and who shall conduct the mediation in accordance with such rules. Franchisor and Franchisee agree that statements made by Franchisor, Franchisee or any other party in any such mediation proceeding will not be admissible in any other legal proceeding. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses of conducting the mediation and share equally the costs of any third parties who are required to participate in the mediation .\n\n17.2.2\tIf any dispute between the parties cannot be resolved through mediation within forty-five (45) days following the appointment of the mediator, the parties agree to resolve such dispute pursuant to litigation in the County of New York, State of New York",

                "explanation": "By removing the specifics of what happens after mediation or the rules and processes of it, Section 17.3 which indicates the venue of any legal action, is now voided. Therefore, this clause no longer flows into what happens next. It removes what a mediation would consist of, the timeline, and most importantly that after a 45 day period disputes shall be pursuant to litigation within New York County. The agreement doesn't account for if it doesn't happen after all and there is no mediation period. ",

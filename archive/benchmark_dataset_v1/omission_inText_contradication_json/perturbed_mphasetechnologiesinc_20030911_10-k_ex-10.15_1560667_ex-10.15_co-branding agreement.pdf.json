                "original_text": "mPhase agrees to abide by the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of this Agreement specifying the dimensions, requirements and specifications, and the review process related to use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo. mPhase understands that these guidelines may be updated from time to time and agrees to abide by those updates as well as the guidelines provided herein.",
                "changed_text": "mPhase agrees to generally consider the guidelines related to the use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo. mPhase may receive updates from time to time and will attempt to incorporate them.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirement to 'abide by' the guidelines in Schedule B, the modified text introduces ambiguity. Schedule B outlines 'Control Specifications,' which become unenforceable as mPhase only needs to 'generally consider' them. The obligation to abide by updates is weakened to attempting to incorporate them, creating uncertainty about whether updates are mandatory.",

                "original_text": "If Lucent determines that mPhase's Goods are no longer maintained at the current level of quality, Lucent shall so notify mPhase, in writing, and Lucent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "If Lucent has concerns regarding mPhase's Goods quality, Lucent may notify mPhase. Lucent reserves its rights.",
                "explanation": "The original clause gives Lucent the right to terminate the agreement if the quality of mPhase's goods falls below a certain level. By changing this to 'Lucent reserves its rights' without specifying what those rights are in this context, it creates uncertainty. Without the explicit termination clause, it's unclear what recourse Lucent has if quality declines. This contradicts the original intention and weakens Lucent's position. There is no clear path to enforcement or resolution, whereas, previously, termination was explicit.",

                "original_text": "mPhase agrees to allow Lucent to inspect the Approved Uses bearing the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, to ensure that those uses reviewed and approved pursuant to the procedure set forth in Schedule B continue to be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "mPhase will consider allowing Lucent to view the Approved Uses bearing the Lucent Co-Branding Logo.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees to allow' to 'will consider allowing,' the clause removes the mandatory obligation for mPhase to permit inspections. This contradicts the purpose of ensuring compliance with the agreement and Schedule B. Without mandatory inspections, Lucent's ability to enforce the co-branding guidelines is significantly weakened, creating uncertainty about oversight and enforcement of quality control and brand standards.",

                "original_text": "1.5 “Development Fee” means 50% of the Net Sales for any Development Products in the Development Territory.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 “Development Fee” means a mutually agreed upon percentage of Net Sales for any Development Products in the Development Territory.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly defines the Development Fee as 50% of Net Sales. The modified text replaces this with a requirement for a 'mutually agreed upon percentage,' creating uncertainty and contradicting any clauses that might implicitly assume a fixed 50% fee. This creates ambiguity in enforcement, as there's no specified default if the parties cannot agree on a percentage.",

                "original_text": "2.3 The first Development Fees payment shall be due forty-five days after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which the first Sale of a Development Product took place. Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than forty-five days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",
                "changed_text": "2.3 The first Development Fees payment shall be due when both parties deem appropriate after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which the first Sale of a Development Product took place. Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees on a schedule to be determined by mutual agreement, and shall furnish CNS with a written statement outlining sales data.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the specific 45-day deadline for Development Fees payments and replaces it with vague language of 'when both parties deem appropriate' and 'a schedule to be determined by mutual agreement.' It also removes the requirement for a detailed accounting of the Development Fees calculation, only requiring a written statement outlining sales data. This omission contradicts the original intent of having a fixed deadline and a verifiable calculation method, introducing significant uncertainty about when and how payments are to be made and verified.",

                "changed_text": "4.1 If MBI exercises its right to terminate the Sublicense Agreement, WPD agrees that CNS shall receive a portion of the Buyback Consideration. The exact amount and terms of this portion will be subject to further negotiation at the time of termination.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states how the Buyback Consideration will be split. The modified version removes the explicit calculation, replacing it with a vague promise of a 'portion' and a future negotiation. This creates a contradiction because it suggests CNS is entitled to something, but doesn't define what that something is or how it is determined. This ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce CNS's rights to the Buyback Consideration.",

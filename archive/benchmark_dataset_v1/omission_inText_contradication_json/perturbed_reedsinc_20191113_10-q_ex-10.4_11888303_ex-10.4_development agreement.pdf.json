                "explanation": "The original text explicitly excludes the 'Neutral Alcohol Beverage Base' from the definition of 'Recipe,' yet it clarifies that the *amount* and *process* of combining it are included. By removing the part about the Neutral Alcohol Beverage Base, the definition becomes less precise, and arguably, the amount of Neutral Alcohol Beverage Base should be considered part of the recipe, leading to an contradiction with other sections on Intellectual property. Changed from Recipe to formulation to bring clarity.",

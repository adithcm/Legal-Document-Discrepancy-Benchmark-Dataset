                "original_text": "“Network’s Advertising Revenue” means the gross dollar amount of collections received by or credited to Network from the sale by Network of commercial advertising time included in the Service, less actual agency representative fees and sales commissions. For clarification, Network’s Advertising Revenue shall not include accounts receivable or Network’s Transactional Revenue.",
                "changed_text": "“Network’s Advertising Revenue” means the gross dollar amount of collections received by or credited to Network from the sale by Network of commercial advertising time included in the Service, less reasonable expenses.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific deductions (agency representative fees and sales commissions) and replacing them with 'reasonable expenses,' the definition becomes vague. Other sections relying on a precise calculation of 'Network's Advertising Revenue' (like Exhibit D on Revenue Share) become difficult to enforce due to the ambiguity in what constitutes 'reasonable expenses'.",

                "original_text": "(b) Exhibit C sets forth the specific equipment necessary for each Station to receive the signal of the Service (the “Receiving Equipment”). At Affiliate’s option, Network shall furnish and install, at its expense, or reimburse Affiliate for its cost of furnishing and installing, the Receiving Equipment to each Station that transmits the Service, provided that the Receiving Equipment for all of the Stations initially listed on Exhibit A shall not exceed, in the aggregate, one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000.00) (the “Equipment Reimbursement Cap”). At Affiliate’s option, Network also shall furnish and install, or reimburse Affiliate for its cost of furnishing and installing, Receiving Equipment for any Acquired Station not transmitting the Service at the time of acquisition by Affiliate, at a cost not to exceed three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500.00).",
                "changed_text": "(b) At Affiliate’s option, Network shall furnish, Receiving Equipment to each Station that transmits the Service, provided that the Receiving Equipment for all of the Stations initially listed on Exhibit A shall be subjected to a reimbursement cap. At Affiliate’s option, Network also shall furnish, Receiving Equipment for any Acquired Station not transmitting the Service at the time of acquisition by Affiliate, at an undefined cost.",
                "explanation": "Removing Exhibit C which lists the 'Specific Equipment' introduces ambiguity. Later references to 'Receiving Equipment' in Section 5(b) now lack a concrete definition, creating a contradiction. Also by removing the  “Equipment Reimbursement Cap” the overall cost becomes undefined, also it is undefined at the Acquired Station.",

                "original_text": "(a) Affiliate shall actively promote the Service consistent with its business judgment, including the broadcast by each Station transmitting the Service of an average of at least ten (10) thirty (30)-second promotional announcements per week for the Service (“Promotional Spots”) on the Station’s Primary Feed, including the Station’s analog signal for so long as the Station broadcasts an analog signal, on a run-of- station basis, commencing no later than the first air date of the Service on the applicable Station.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Affiliate shall promote the Service at its discretion. Affiliate will submit program listings for the Service to local print and on-screen guides. Additionally, Affiliate will provide a link to Network’s website (i.e., URL www.thetubetv.com or any replacement or supplemental URL) on the websites of each of the Stations.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirement of 'ten (10) thirty (30)-second promotional announcements per week' but retaining the general obligation to 'promote the Service,' creates a contradiction. The original text details a specific promotional commitment which is removed but still requires promotion of the service. This makes enforcement subjective and dependent on the Affiliate's interpretation of 'promote'.",

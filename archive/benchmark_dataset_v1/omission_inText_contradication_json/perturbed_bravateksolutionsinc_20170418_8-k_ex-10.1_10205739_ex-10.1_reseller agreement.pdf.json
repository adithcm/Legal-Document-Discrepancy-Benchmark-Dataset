                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "e. “Net Revenue” shall mean gross receipts collected by Company or Reseller from the distribution of Company Products, [less third party commissions, equipment sales, delivery costs, taxes, refunds, and credits.",
                "changed_text": "e. “Net Revenue” shall mean gross receipts collected by Company or Reseller from the distribution of Company Products.",
                "explanation": "By removing the deductions from gross receipts, the definition of 'Net Revenue' becomes vague. Later sections, particularly Exhibit B regarding Reseller Compensation, rely on a clear calculation of 'Net Revenue'. This omission creates ambiguity in determining the actual commission amount owed to the reseller, creating a contradiction between the intent of compensation and the means of calculating it. The enforcement of compensation becomes uncertain.",

                "changed_text": "Company shall provide Reseller with reasonable support.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific reference to 'Exhibit B,' which details the nature of company support obligations (Product Training, Marketing Materials, Personnel Resources), introduces ambiguity. While the Company is still obligated to provide 'reasonable support', the definition and scope are undefined. This creates a contradiction as the contract implies support is defined elsewhere (Exhibit B) but the reference is removed, potentially leading to disputes over what constitutes reasonable support.",

                "explanation": "By removing the references to Exhibit A (Lead Form) and Exhibit B (Reseller Compensation), the clause becomes internally contradictory. It stipulates a Referral Fee is payable but removes the mechanism for submitting a referral (Exhibit A), and, more importantly, how the fee is calculated (Exhibit B). This leaves the Reseller with a right to a fee but no clear way to claim it or for the Company to accurately calculate it, creating significant enforcement uncertainty and contradiction.",

Prior to any initial Exploitation of a PFHOF Work, the Village Media Company, at its own expense, must furnish to the Advisory Board and PFHOF a written notice (“Notice”) which Notice will set forth the Village Media Company’s proposal for Exploitation of a PFHOF Work (whether by itself or as incorporated into a HOFV Work), which proposal shall at a minimum specify the applicable PFHOF Work(s) to be Exploited by the Village Media Company, the nature and location of the proposed Exploitation and a pro forma specifying the economics and approximate time period related to such Exploitation. The Advisory Board shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the Notice, make a recommendation to PFHOF to either approve or reject such proposal as set forth in the Notice. PFHOF shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice. If PFHOF does not approve the proposal as set forth in the Notice within fourteen (14) days of PFHOF’s receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, such proposal shall be deemed rejected by PFHOF. In the event that a proposal is rejected (or deemed rejected) by PFHOF, PFHOF shall, upon request from the Village Media Company, provide a written explanation (with reasonable detail) outlining its reason for rejecting such proposal. Upon PFHOF’s approval with respect to any such proposal, the Village Media Company (and its Affiliates and permitted licensees) may Exploit the applicable PFHOF Work(s) so long as such Exploitation is in conformance with the proposal as approved by PFHOF (including any proposed sublicenses in accordance with Section 2.4).",

Prior to any initial Exploitation of a PFHOF Work, the Village Media Company, at its own expense, must furnish to PFHOF a written notice (“Notice”) which Notice will set forth the Village Media Company’s proposal for Exploitation of a PFHOF Work. The Village Media Company (and its Affiliates and permitted licensees) may Exploit the applicable PFHOF Work(s).",
                "explanation": "Removing the Advisory Board and the approval process by PFHOF eliminates the mechanism that ensures a balanced decision-making process. By changing from 'approve' to 'provide feedback' the enforceability of PFHOF's control is reduced. This weakens the checks and balances intended to protect the PFHOF Works, potentially leading to conflicts regarding the use of those works.",

The Parties acknowledge and agree that two hundred twenty five thousand dollars ($225,000) (the “Youth Sports License Fee”) shall be credited against the Annual Guarantee on the Closing Date and each anniversary of the Closing Date during the Term for the license granted by PFHOF to Youth Sports Management, LLC (“Youth Sports”) pursuant to that certain branding license agreement to be entered into on the Effective Date between PFHOF and Youth Sports for so long as such agreement remains in effect; provided that after the first five (5) years of the Term, the Youth Sports License Fee shall increase by three percent (3%) on a year-over year basis and thereafter, the aggregate amount of the Youth Sports License Fee, after giving effect to such increase each year, shall be the amount credited against the Annual Guarantee.",

Affiliate is only eligible to\nearn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term\nof this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain\npayable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned.\n(2) Insofar as the referred end user accepts cookies when clicking on\nAffiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do\narise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or\npossibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher\nvia integrated link.\n(3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of\nsaid Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate.\n(4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost\nCompensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes,\nshipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user.\nThe percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be\nstipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the\neffective gross sales price of the software.\n(5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as\nit is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or\nwill meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to\nthe end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit\ncard charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software\nproduct occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid\nby element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own\ndiscretion.\n(6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly\ninsofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not\nthe case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100\nEUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the\nAffiliate's participation in the Program.\n(7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or\ncheck, as chosen by the Affiliate.\n(8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object\nin writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specifics on VAT invoicing, cookie lifespan, frequency for computing, compensation percentage and minimum payment amounts, the contract creates inconsistencies.

There is now no method to determine the advertising cost compensation. The reference to Direct Deposit (US Only) is also removed.",

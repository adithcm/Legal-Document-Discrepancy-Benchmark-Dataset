                "explanation": "The original text clearly outlines a payment schedule with specific amounts and milestones. The modified text removes the set amounts for milestones 1-4, introducing ambiguity and contradiction. While a total fee is mentioned, the lack of a concrete schedule creates uncertainty in enforcement and relies heavily on future mutual agreement, potentially conflicting with the initial fee agreement.",

                "explanation": "The change removes the specific payment gateway (Evergreen Gateway) and changes 'will' to 'may' regarding account information storage. This creates uncertainty. The original text implies a mandatory payment method and storage, while the modified text makes both optional, potentially contradicting the original intention and leading to disputes about acceptable payment methods or data storage practices.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Trulioo API', the contract no longer specifies how ID verification will be conducted. This creates ambiguity as the exact method for verification becomes unclear. The change creates an internal contradiction because the rest of the application has been built using Trulioo API, removing the specification that was built upon opens the possibility of the contract being unenforceable.",

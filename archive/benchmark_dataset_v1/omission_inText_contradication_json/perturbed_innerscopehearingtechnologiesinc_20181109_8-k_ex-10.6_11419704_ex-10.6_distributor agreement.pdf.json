                "original_text": "Distributor shall use its best efforts to market, promote and sell the Products to the authorized customers in the Filed of Use and in the Territory during the term of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall use reasonable efforts to market, promote, and sell the Products in the Territory during the term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'Field of Use' clause, the distributor's obligations become ambiguous. Later sections define the 'Field of Use' as treatment of hearing disorders, but now the distributor is only bound to market in the 'Territory'. This creates uncertainty as to whether the distributor can market the products for other uses within the Territory.",

Such purchase orders shall set forth the quantity of each product ordered, the required delivery date, and the point of delivery. The price for the Products shall be as designated in Schedule A. Erchonia may revise its prices from time to time and deliver a written 90 day notice of the reasonable price revision to Distributor; provided that Erchonia agrees that the prices listed in Exhibit A shall not be increased during the first 90 days of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Erchonia agrees to provide Products to Distributor pursuant to orders placed by Distributor. The price for the Products shall be determined by Erchonia. Erchonia may revise its prices from time to time with notice to Distributor.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specificity regarding purchase orders, required delivery dates, and the pricing being designated in Schedule A, creates an internal contradiction. While the modified text states Erchonia sets the price, Schedule A still exists and references prices. The original clause limits price increases during the first 90 days, but the modified text removes that restriction, creating uncertainty about the applicable pricing structure.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Erchonia grants Distributor a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Trademarks for advertising and promotion of Products. Distributor shall use the Trademarks according to quality standards defined by Erchonia which shall be reasonable and shall be no greater than the standards used by Erchonia for its own advertising and promotion. Upon Erchonia’s request, the Distributor shall at its expense deliver to Erchonia representative samples of labels, advertisements, catalogs, spec sheets, and the like, containing the Trademarks, and to inspect all of Distributors websites, social media accounts and any online information posted by Distributor, to ensure that such Trademarks are used only in a manner complaint with the quality standards. Should such material fail to meet the standards set by Erchonia, as determined by Erchonia in its sole discretion, Distributor shall not use and shall withdraw and retract any promotion or advertising that Erchonia finds unsuitable and will at its expense destroy such materials or make them compliant.",

Distributor shall use the Trademarks according to the general guidelines provided by Erchonia. Distributor will ensure that such Trademarks are used only in a manner compliant with the quality standards.",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed process for quality control (samples, inspections, Erchonia's 'sole discretion'), the modified text introduces ambiguity. The original provides a procedure where Erchonia actively monitors and approves materials. The modification only requires adhering to 'general guidelines', but doesn't specify enforcement, leaving it unclear how compliance will be ensured and creating a contradiction with Erchonia's continued rights to the Trademarks.",

Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and VOTOCAST'S sole and exclusive liability for any loss or interruption of Services shall be as follows. For loss or interruption of Services which is not due to scheduled maintenance, and is caused by VOTOCAST, and such loss or interruption of Services exceeds a continual period of one (I) hour per Exhibit C, Licensee shall receive a credit against future Services equal to one-thirtieth (1/30) of the monthly fees for the Services for each cumulative hour, up to a maximum total of the fees charged for Services for the applicable month of the affected Services.",

Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and VOTOCAST'S sole and exclusive liability for any loss or interruption of Services shall be determined at VOTOCAST's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific details of how credit is calculated based on Exhibit C, while still referencing 'Credit for Interruption of Services', the changed text introduces ambiguity and contradiction. The original clause clearly outlines a formula, while the modified text makes credit assignment arbitrary, thus creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

Prior to the payment of the License and Hosting Fees defined in Exhibit A, Licensee shall have the right to conduct acceptance testing (\"Acceptance Testing\") to verify that the Services satisfy the acceptance criteria set forth in Exhibit B (\"Acceptance Criteria\"). Acceptance Testing shall commence within five (5) business days from the date on which VOTOCAST notifies Licensee, in writing by U.S. mail or electronic mail that all implementation work has been completed and is ready for Acceptance Testing by Licensee. In the event that the Services do not conform to the Acceptance Criteria, Licensee shall give VOTOCAST written notice thereof. VOTOCAST shall make commercially reasonable efforts to correct any deficiencies that prevent the Services from conforming to the Acceptance Criteria. When the Services have successfully conformed to or satisfied the Acceptance Criteria, Licensee shall give VOTOCAST written notice by U.S. mail or electronic mail of acceptance (\"Acceptance\"). Acceptance by Licensee shall be automatically deemed to have occurred: (a) fifteen (15) business days after Licensee's receipt, if Licensee does not communicate to VOTOCAST any defects in the Services, or (b) if Licensee uses the Services in the normal and usual operation of Licensee's business prior to written Acceptance. Licensee shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if, in its sole discretion, the Services have not conformed to the Acceptance Criteria within thirty (30) days from the date of Acceptance Testing; provided however, VOTOCAST shall continue to be entitled to receive, and Licensee shall be obligated to pay to VOTOCAST, any and all amounts owing for Implementation Fees up to the date of termination.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibit B (Acceptance Criteria), and instead using \"deemed unsatisfactory\" the original section loses its clear and objective criteria for acceptance testing. The clause now lacks a defined benchmark and relies on subjective evaluation by the Licensee, potentially leading to disputes about whether the services are truly \"unsatisfactory\" and whether VOTOCAST's efforts are sufficiently \"commercially reasonable.\" This change generates ambiguity in enforcement and undermines the clause's original intent of ensuring services meet specific pre-defined standards.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibit C (Service Levels), while still mentioning support escalation, the clause creates an omission. The original section refers to Exhibit C, where the specific service levels and response times are detailed. Without this reference, the support clause becomes vague and unenforceable, as there is no defined standard for response times or service quality. This introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult for the Licensee to hold VOTOCAST accountable for providing adequate support, undermining the clause's original purpose of guaranteeing a certain level of service.",

During the Term and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, Wade agrees to provide Naked with the following services (collectively, the “Wade Services”):\nA. During the first Contract Year, Wade will be available for (i) one production day for the purpose of creating marketing assets for Naked Products for unlimited use in advertisements and the media and (ii) one production day for creating marketing assets for Wade Products and Naked Products for unlimited use in advertisements and the media, each as permitted herein. Wade shall be available to render services at such production day for a maximum of three (3) consecutive hours, not including scheduled breaks, during each such production day period; provided that, in the event an additional production day is reasonably required for the creation of marketing assets related to the Wade Product packaging, Athlete will be available to render services for up to an additional three (3) hours in either the first Contract Year or the second Contract Year but not both. The scheduling and content of said production days shall be mutually determined by Wade and Naked, subject to Wade’s professional availability;\nB. Beginning in the second Contract Year, Wade will be available for a maximum of one (1) production day for creating marketing assets for Wade Products and Naked Products for unlimited use in advertisements and the media, for a maximum of three (3) consecutive hours, not including scheduled breaks, during such production day period. The scheduling and content of said production days shall be mutually determined by Wade and Naked, subject to Wade’s professional availability;\nC. During each Contract Year, Wade will be available for two (2) personal appearances (each, a “Personal Appearance”) on behalf of Naked and the Naked Products and Wade Products in the media, including publicity shoots, interviews, print, television, radio and social media channels, each appearance for a maximum of sixty (60) consecutive minutes to be scheduled at a time mutually agreeable to Naked and Wade;",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific quantities of production days, hours of service, and duration of personal appearances, introduces ambiguity. While retaining 'Wade Services', removing detail on the extent of these services makes enforcement uncertain. This conflicts with the stated intention to clearly outline Wade's service commitment. Later sections of the contract refer to Wade Services, creating a direct contradiction to the expected level of service.",

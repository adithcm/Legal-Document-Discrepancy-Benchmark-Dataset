                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "PAYMENT TERMS\nAll Parties agreed the payment listed below are fair and just for the services being provided. Payment\nto the following individual below within 7 days upon completion and handover on the Project to VAL.\nNo.\nName\nFunction\nAmount\n1.\nMs. Chen Weijie\nCoordinator/Lead Developer\nUSD100,000.00\n2.\nMr. Zheng Qing\nDeveloper\nUSD50,000.00\n3.\nMr. Gu Xianwin\nDeveloper\nUSD50,000.00",
                "changed_text": "PAYMENT TERMS\nAll Parties agreed that payments will be made for services provided. Specific payment amounts will be determined based on project progress.",
                "explanation": "By removing the itemized payment schedule, the modified text creates uncertainty about the compensation structure. While it acknowledges payments, it lacks specifics, contradicting the initial agreement on fixed amounts for each developer. This makes enforcement unclear as there's no longer a pre-agreed payment breakdown. This absence contradicts the original intent of a fixed price agreement.",

                "changed_text": "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP\nIntellectual Property rights will be determined at a later stage.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clear statement that all IP is owned by VAL, and replacing it with a vague statement about future determination, the revised text introduces a contradiction. Other sections may rely on VAL's ownership for project execution, but this modification creates ambiguity and undermines the certainty of IP control initially intended. This uncertainty could lead to disputes.",
                "location": "Clause 11"

If\nthe customer terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of\ntermination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis. Developer may also terminate this Agreement by\ngiving two (2) weeks’ notice in writing to VAL. It is applicable only when the project is not completed.\nIn case Developer terminates the agreement, it shall handover the entire project related IPR, work\ndone till date to VAL.",
                "changed_text": "TERMINATION\nVAL may terminate this agreement with written notice. Developer may also terminate this agreement with written notice. Specific obligations upon termination will be subject to further negotiation.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specifics regarding the conditions for termination (developer breach, project not completed), the pro-rata compensation clause, and the IPR handover requirement, the modified text makes the termination process vague. The phrase 'specific obligations upon termination will be subject to further negotiation' directly contradicts the initial agreement on clear termination procedures and responsibilities, creating uncertainty about the consequences of ending the agreement. This directly contrasts the original intent of clearly defined processes of termination and IPR transference",

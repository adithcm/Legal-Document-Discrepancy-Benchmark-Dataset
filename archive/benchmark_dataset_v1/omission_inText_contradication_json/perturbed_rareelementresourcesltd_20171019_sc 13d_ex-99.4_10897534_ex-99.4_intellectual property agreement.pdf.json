                "original_text": "2.10 \"Improvement\" or \"Improvements\" means any modification of a process or other technology described in a Patent, and any modification to Technical Information.",
                "changed_text": "2.10 \"Improvement\" or \"Improvements\" means any tangible modification to equipment.",
                "explanation": "By narrowing the definition of 'Improvement' to only tangible equipment modifications, the contract creates an internal contradiction with sections (like 5.00, 5.01 and 5.02) that discuss Improvements related to processes or Technical Information. This omission introduces uncertainty regarding the scope of rights and obligations related to process improvements.",

The non-exclusive rights granted to Investor under this Article 3.02 do not include the right to grant sublicenses to Third Parties. The amount and parameters of the annual licensing fee shall be commercially reasonable, as determined by an independent expert who is mutually agreeable to the Parties and whose determination shall be final and bindingÍ¾ provided, however, that if the Parties cannot agree on the independent expert, each Party shall designate an expert of their choice and the two experts designated by the Parties shall work together in good faith to identify and designate a third, independent expert whose determination shall be binding.",
                "changed_text": "3.02 If the Option is not exercised prior to the expiration of the Option Period, then Company agrees to extend the license grants set forth in Articles 3.00 and 3.01 beyond the expiration of the Option Period, subject to an annual licensing fee paid by Investor to Company. The non-exclusive rights granted to Investor under this Article 3.02 do not include the right to grant sublicenses to Third Parties. The amount of the annual licensing fee will be determined at Company's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing how the license fee is determined from a commercially reasonable amount determined by an independent expert to one determined by the company at its sole discretion, this creates a contradiction with the idea of 'fair and reasonable licensing' that is often assumed for IP rights. Also, it impacts the Investor's benefit of the bargain.",

In addition, for as long as there continues to exist Technical Information of use by Investor in its business, any rights or licenses Investor has in Technical Information under this Agreement shall survive termination of this IP Agreement under Article 16.00 but not termination under Articles 16.01 or 16.02 for material breach.",

                "explanation": "By removing Article V from the survival clause, it implies that rights related to Improvements do not survive termination, contradicting the implicit protections of 'Improvements' ownership granted in the Investment Agreement, where intellectual property rights are presumably assigned value during investment assessment. This introduces an enforcement issue regarding improvements made but not fully exploited before termination.",

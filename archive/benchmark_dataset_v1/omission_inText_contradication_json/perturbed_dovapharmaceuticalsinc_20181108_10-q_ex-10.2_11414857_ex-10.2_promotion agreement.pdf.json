                "explanation": "By removing the 'Specialty Fraction' and 'Gross to Net Fraction' components from the definition of 'Non-Retail Net Sales,' we create an ambiguity in financial reporting. Later sections, such as 6.3.1, continue to reference and depend on these fractions for calculating the promotion fee. The omission leads to uncertainty in how the Non-Retail Net Sales are accurately determined, impacting the final amount paid to Valeant and potentially leading to financial disputes.",

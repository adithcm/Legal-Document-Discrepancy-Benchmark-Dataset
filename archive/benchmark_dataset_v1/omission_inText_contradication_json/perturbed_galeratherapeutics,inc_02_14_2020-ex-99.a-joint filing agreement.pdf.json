                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the “Exchange Act”) the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to 'Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the “Exchange Act”' and 'under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto)', the modified text creates ambiguity. Later sections rely on the implied understanding that filings comply with these regulations, but this is no longer explicitly stated. This omission could lead to disputes about whether the filing obligations are indeed governed by the Securities Exchange Act.",

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each party is responsible for ensuring the filings are accurate. No party is responsible for the information provided by other parties.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein' to 'Each party is responsible for ensuring the filings are accurate' removes the explicit mention of 'timely filing'. While accuracy is still mentioned, the removal of 'timely filing' can create inconsistencies if other clauses or regulations rely on timely submissions. In addition, the omission of  'unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate' removes an important exception, making the disclaimer of responsibility absolute, and potentially contradicting implied duties of due diligence.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the ability of a single party to revoke the agreement ('revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party'), the modified text now requires mutual agreement for termination. If other parts of the agreement still allude to the possibility of a single party withdrawing (e.g., clauses about individual liability after withdrawal), this creates a contradiction. This directly affects the ability of individual parties to exit the agreement, creating enforcement uncertainty.",

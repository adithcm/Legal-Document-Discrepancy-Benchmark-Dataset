Except as specified in this section, each party\nmay freely use and disclose any information (both individual and aggregated)\nabout Users (\"User Data\").  Neither party shall disclose any User Data in any\nmanner that permits the User Data to be associated with the other party or\npermits the targeting of Users on the basis of their status as Users (in\ntheglobe's case) or theglobe users (in Boxlot's case), nor shall a party use the\nUser Data to target Users on the basis of their status as Users (in theglobe's\ncase) or theglobe users (in Boxlot's case).  However, either party may disclose\nUser Data if it is aggregated (in a non-associatable way) with data from\nmultiple online properties.  Each party shall use and disclose User Data only in\naccordance with the privacy policy under which it was collected.",
                "changed_text": "5.  USER DATA.\n     5.1  Rights/Restrictions.  Except as specified in this section, each party may freely use and disclose any information (both individual and aggregated) about Users (“User Data”). Each party shall use and disclose User Data in its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the restrictions on using User Data, the modified text directly contradicts the original limitations on associating User Data with the other party or targeting Users based on their status. The later sentence now gives each party sole discretion on using the data, potentially nullifying the privacy requirements mentioned earlier, leading to enforcement uncertainty.",

The parties shall make the payments described in Exhibit A.\nOverdue payments shall accrue interest, at the lesser of 1 1/2% per month or the\nmaximum allowable interest under applicable law, from due date until paid, and\nthe owing party shall pay the owed party's costs of collection (including\nreasonable attorneys' fees).",

                "explanation": "By removing the detail on how interest is calculated, particularly the 1 1/2% cap or maximum allowable interest under law, and 'reasonable attorneys' fees', it creates an ambiguity. The contract still mandates interest on overdue payments, but the absence of a specific rate makes it difficult to enforce, especially if interpretations differ on what constitutes 'allowable interest' or reasonable attorney fees.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific list of sections that survive termination, including sections like 'Ownership', 'Audit Rights', and 'Governing Law,' it creates uncertainty about which clauses remain enforceable after the agreement ends. The contract still states licenses terminate, but the removal of clarity on surviving clauses generates ambiguity and potential disputes regarding post-termination obligations, particularly legal jurisdiction and intellectual property.",

                "original_text": "(c) Party B shall ensure the vehicles are in good conditions, the compartments are properly sealed without leakage and the vehicles are\nequipped with fire-fighting equipment. In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the\nstandard rate of RMB200 per parcel, and indemnify the actual price for high-end insured parcel (or indemnify by the value of the\nparcel provided by arbitration department determined by Party A).",

In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall provide some compensation.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific compensation amount of RMB200 per parcel and the method for high-end insured parcels, the modified text creates uncertainty regarding the extent of Party B's liability. The remaining phrase 'provide some compensation' is vague and unenforceable. Other clauses may rely on a fixed indemnity, creating an internal contradiction if they reference a standard compensation rate which no longer exists in the modified section.",

In the\nspecial event of changes to route and time and severe weather (or other force majeure events), Party B shall be in touch with\nParty A in time and record such special event on the parcel transfer documents with Party A’s approval.",

                "explanation": "By replacing the specific liquidated damages amounts (RMB500, RMB1,000, RMB2,000) with 'some penalty,' the modified text removes the established financial consequences of delays. This creates ambiguity and renders the enforcement of delay penalties uncertain. Other sections referencing 'liquidated damages' based on the old calculation now contradict this section which only mandates 'some penalty' without quantification.",

Within the contract period, Party B shall not charge the\nfreight difference if Party A rents same-level vehicles. Party B shall also compensate Party A’s other losses.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces the defined 'one-month freight as liquidated damages' with 'may face some penalty,' removing the concrete financial obligation for early termination without consent. This creates significant ambiguity and makes the enforcement of penalties for early termination difficult. If the contract refers to liquidated damages in a specific financial amount, this now contradicts it.",

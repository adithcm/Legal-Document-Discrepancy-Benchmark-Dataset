                "original_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",
                "changed_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, however, certain provisions of the Original Agreement, as outlined in Appendix A, shall remain in effect.",
                "explanation": "By stating that certain provisions of the Original Agreement 'shall remain in effect' while simultaneously claiming the agreement 'shall terminate and be of no further force or effect', an internal contradiction is created. This makes enforcement uncertain, as the scope of the termination is now unclear.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Termination Agreement represents the general understanding between the parties but is subject to further amendments as needed.",
                "explanation": "The original clause asserts that the Termination Agreement is the 'complete, integrated, and entire agreement', precluding modifications except in writing. The changed text directly contradicts this by stating it represents only a 'general understanding' and is 'subject to further amendments', creating an internal contradiction about the finality and modifiability of the agreement. It doesn't require modification in writing.",

                "changed_text": "3. This Termination Agreement shall be governed by the laws as mutually agreed upon, considering relevant international jurisdictions.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that the Termination Agreement is governed by the 'laws of the PRC'. The modified clause contradicts this by stating that it shall be governed by laws 'as mutually agreed upon' and taking into account 'international jurisdictions'. This creates uncertainty about which legal framework applies and implies the application of laws beyond the PRC. It is contradicting the primary law to be used to govern the agreement.",

                "original_text": "This amendment to Section 2 (titled \"Term\"), Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement is made effective December 9, 1996 by and between PC Quote, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW and all of their subsidiaries and related companies.",
                "changed_text": "This amendment to Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement is made effective December 9, 1996 by and between PC Quote, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW and all of their subsidiaries and related companies.",
                "explanation": "By removing \"Section 2 (titled 'Term')\", the modified text creates ambiguity. If other sections of the original Co-Branding Agreement refer specifically to 'Section 2' regarding the Term, this amendment now lacks a clear connection to that section. This introduces an inconsistency as it's unclear if the amendment alters the 'Term' section or some other unspecified aspect of Part B. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement relating to the duration of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the date fields in the agreement creates uncertainty. Later sections might refer to the 'effective date' of the agreement as defined in this section. Because the exact execution dates are now removed, any clauses related to these dates are now subject to dispute and interpretation. It generates ambiguity around timelines associated to performance obligations.",

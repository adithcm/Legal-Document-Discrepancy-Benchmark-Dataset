                "original_text": "1.21 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective (e.g., Development Activities and Commercialization hereunder), the level of efforts consistent with the efforts and resources [***] of similar market potential, at a similar stage in development or product lifecycle, taking into account the stage of development or product lifecycle of other of [***] product candidates, safety and efficacy, product profile, cost of goods, the competitiveness of the marketplace, such company’s patent position with respect to such product (including such company’s ability to obtain or enforce, or have obtained or enforced, such patent rights), the Third Party patent landscape relevant to the product, the regulatory structure involved, the likelihood of regulatory approval, the likelihood and extent of anticipated or actual profitability of the applicable product, and other technical, legal, scientific and medical considerations. Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific metrics that determine 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts,' the modified text creates uncertainty. Enforcement becomes difficult as there are no clear benchmarks to measure the effort exerted by a Party. The removed text considers product lifecycle, safety, product profile, cost of goods, market competitiveness, patent position, regulatory structure, likelihood of regulatory approval, anticipated profitability and other considerations. This leaves the term open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'Notwithstanding subsections (i) and (ii) above, the Royalty Term for a Product in a country shall not [***].', a potential contradiction may arise. Other clauses may assume that there are royalty terms, but now the contract omits if the royalty terms can indeed, be canceled, causing uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'effective [***] ([***]) days after receipt of written notice thereof by Aimmune', the contract removes the required timeframe in which Xencor is required to wait before being allowed to terminate the agreement. While the section maintains Xencor's right to terminate the agreement, the absence of the timeframe is problematic. Because the contract maintains the termination clause but omits the timeframe, this can introduce contradictions because clauses or assumptions may assume that there is a waiting period before the agreemnet terminates.",

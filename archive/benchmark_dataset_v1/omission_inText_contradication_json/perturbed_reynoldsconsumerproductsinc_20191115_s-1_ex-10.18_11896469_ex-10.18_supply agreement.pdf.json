The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will survive the expiration or earlier\ntermination of this Agreement with respect to any (i) products purchased and sold under this Agreement during the Term and products sold after the\nTerm for orders accepted during the Term; (ii) Confidential Information (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement) disclosed or received by a Party\nduring the Term; (iii) breach of this Agreement by a Party; (iv) any other statement, decision, act or omission of a Party concerning or related to this\nAgreement; (v) any Dispute (as defined in Section 11 of this Agreement) between the Parties concerning or related to this Agreement; (vi) products and\nother materials manufactured or maintained by Seller in inventory for sale to Buyer that Buyer is obligated to purchase under a Purchase Schedule; and\n(vii) any provision that expressly states that it will survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies clear conditions for the Term's end. The modified version stating 'continue indefinitely' directly contradicts the earlier conditions (a) and (b) and creates an inconsistency as 'continue indefinitely' and 'subject to termination' oppose each other.",

If a Disclosing Party neglects to\nlabel or deliver timely written notice to the Receiving Party identifying the disclosed information as confidential in nature, the\ndisclosed information will only be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement if the Disclosing Party is able to\ndemonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Receiving Party knew that the disclosed information was a trade secret\nor other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure.\n\nThe criteria in Clause (2) and Clause (3) will not apply to Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party observed or heard by a Receiving\nParty in a plant, warehouse, facility or system of the Disclosing Party.

                "explanation": "The removal of 'for the Authorized Purpose' and 'or describes the disclosed information in reasonable detail in a written notice to the Receiving Party delivered, either at the time of disclosure or within five (5) days of disclosure.' changes the scope. It makes confidentiality based primarily on labeling, potentially conflicting with later sections that might refer to the necessity of fulfilling all criteria mentioned initially. This change creates ambiguity regarding what constitutes confidential information and how it should be treated.",

                "explanation": "By explicitly stating that amendments can be made through various documents (purchase order, invoice, bill of lading, letter, email, etc.), the modified text creates a contradiction because, while a signed agreement by CEOs is still required, the process is now initiated and potentially altered outside of that formal structure. The 'unless made in writing' provision conflicts with the implied possibility of informal amendments, creating potential confusion in enforcement.",

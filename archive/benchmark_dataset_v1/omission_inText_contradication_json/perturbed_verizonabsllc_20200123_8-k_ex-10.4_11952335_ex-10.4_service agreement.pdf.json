On each Payment Date, the Issuer will pay the Servicing Fee to the Servicer according to Section 8.2 of the Indenture. In addition, the Servicer may retain any Supplemental Servicing Fees. The Servicer will also receive the Temporarily Excluded Receivables Servicing Fee on each Payment Date, which will be payable solely from Collections on the Temporarily Excluded Receivables, as set forth in Section 3.5(b).",

On each Payment Date, the Issuer will pay certain fees to the Servicer. In addition, the Servicer may retain any Supplemental Servicing Fees.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific mention of the `Servicing Fee` and `Temporarily Excluded Receivables Servicing Fee`, while other sections like 8.2 of the Indenture still references them, an in-text contradiction is created. Enforcement becomes uncertain as the primary compensation method is undefined, but still referenced.",

Cellco, as Sponsor, agrees that (i) each of the Sponsor, the Master Trust, each Originator and the nominee of the Originators is under the common control of Verizon and therefore, the nominee of the Originators (which nominee is also the sole equityholder of the Master Trust) is a “majority-owned affiliate” of the Sponsor as defined in the U.S. Credit Risk Retention Rules, (ii) the Sponsor will cause the nominee of the Originators to, and the nominee of the Originators will, retain the Residual Interest on the Closing Date and (iii) the Sponsor will not, and will not permit the Master Trust, the Originators or the nominee of the Originators to, sell, transfer, finance or hedge the Residual Interest except as permitted by the U.S. Credit Risk Retention Rules.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific definition of 'majority-owned affiliate' and the obligation of the nominee of the Originators to retain the Residual Interest, while still mentioning compliance with risk retention, creates ambiguity. This section vaguely refers to risk retention but removes the key details, contradicting the intent of compliance referenced.",

The parties may amend this Agreement (including Appendix A) to clarify an ambiguity, correct an error or correct or supplement any term of this Agreement that may be defective or inconsistent with the other terms of this Agreement, or to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, in each case, without the consent of the Noteholders, the Certificateholders or any other Person. The parties may amend any term or provision of this Agreement (including Appendix A) from time to time for the purpose of conforming the terms of this Agreement (including Appendix A) to the description thereof in the Prospectus, without the consent of Noteholders, the Certificateholders or any other Person. The Administrator may amend any term or provision of this Agreement (including Appendix A) from time to time for the purpose of making Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, without the consent of Noteholders, the Certificateholders, any party to this Agreement or any other Person. Notice of the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, the determination of a Benchmark Replacement and the making of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will be delivered in writing by the Administrator to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, a Responsible Person of the Indenture Trustee, the Parent Support Provider, the Sponsor, the Depositor and the Servicer and included in the Monthly Investor Report. Notwithstanding anything in the Transaction Documents to the contrary, upon the delivery of notice to a Responsible Person of the Indenture Trustee and the inclusion of such information in the Monthly Investor Report, the relevant Transaction Documents will be deemed to have been amended to reflect the new Unadjusted",

                "explanation": "By removing the 'Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes' clause while leaving (b) and (c), which might reference amendment procedures with noteholder consent, there's a potential contradiction: Clause (a) says parties can amend to correct errors without consent, but other sections imply consent might be needed, creating uncertainty.",

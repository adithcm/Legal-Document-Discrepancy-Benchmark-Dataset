The\nformula for arriving at the per Transaction\nInquiry amount may be revised from time to\ntime during the term of this Agreement to\nreflect present market conditions (\"the\nAdjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual\nconsent of the parties after good faith discussions.\nThe Adjusted Rate shall be added as an\naddendum to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific formula for calculating the advertising fees based on Transaction Inquiries, the contract now vaguely states that the advertising fee will be based on a 'per Transaction Inquiry amount' but provides no initial calculation. This creates an ambiguity and potential for disputes because the initial basis for the fee calculation is undefined. Later sections that mention payment are now referencing something not clearly defined.",

While it can be inferred from context, the omission introduces ambiguity. Later sections referencing the 'Domain Name' for purposes of trademark restrictions and enforcement actions are now less clear because its primary definition is missing.",

Where ExxonMobil intends to invoke these statutory provisions, FCE, upon request, will cooperate and coordinate its activities with ExxonMobil with respect to any submissions, filings or other activities in support thereof.",

                "explanation": "By removing 8.02 (b)(1)(ii), 8.02(b)(1)(iii) from the original license, FCE has fewer royalty-free licenses compared to the initial contract in the event of termination, since the original text provides the right of first refusal. This creates a contradiction between the license section and this termination section. This creates enforcement ambiguity, as it is unclear whether FCE will be compensated for it's work.",

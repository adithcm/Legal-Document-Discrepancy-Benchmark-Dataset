The modified text replaces this with a vague 'industry best practices,' creating uncertainty and potential contradiction if other sections assume or require ISO13488 compliance.

                "explanation": "The original text outlines a strict obligation for Contractor to maintain FGI within specific quantities and customer is liable to purchase any FGI held for more than 3 months. By removing the minimum/maximum levels, the obligation to hold FGI is not clear and the purchasing agreement is also removed. This creates an internal contradiction as Customer has to purchase FGI as specified in other sections but without these specifics, this agreement is not clear.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 12 month warranty period. The modified text removes this period, and the term that they will comply with IPC610.B, creating uncertainty about the warranty's duration and standards. Additionally, the clear \"repair or replace\" obligation and RMA are removed. The term \"address the Customer's claim fairly\" does not create a clear obligation about what Contractor is expected to do. This is contradictory in that the warranty now exists, but the specific terms surrounding it are unclear.",

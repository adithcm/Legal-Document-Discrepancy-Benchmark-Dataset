                "explanation": "The automatic renewal clause and the definition of \"Term\" were removed. Later paragraphs refer to the 'Term' of the agreement, implying a defined renewal process, but the clause providing for automatic annual renewal is now absent, creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration beyond the initial year.",

Cash Payments:\n(1) ESSI will provide monthly payment of Ten Thousand and NO/100 Dollars ($10,000) made payable to Talent for Talent's social\ncommunications with its followers on popular social media venues, including, but not limited to, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snap Chat where\nTalent may communicate about the ESSI product suite (\"Social Communication\"). The monthly Social Communication schedule will be mutually\nagreed upon by Talent and ESSI one month in advance of the actual month of communications. Once the monthly Social Communication schedule\nis set, the volume of Posts, Tweets and Snaps will determine the total amount of monthly compensation available to Talent. ESSI's Social Media\nManager will keep track of Talent's activity pursuant to ESSI's Company quarter to determine the amount of Cash Payment due for the quarter.\n(a) Payments shall be made to Talent in the following manner, and to the following address:",

                "explanation": "The Cash Payments section (5.B) has been removed. This omission creates a contradiction because the agreement still refers to 'consideration' for Talent's services in other clauses, implying there's more than just equity, but the details of those cash payments are no longer defined. This creates ambiguity in determining the full compensation package, especially in the event of early termination.",

Paragraph 9 still discusses review and approval of Commercial Placements and/or Press Releases, but without 9.1, there's no explicit prohibition against Talent initiating press releases, nor are there clear repercussions for unauthorized releases. The inconsistency arises because the approval process is still referenced, but the associated restriction and penalty are gone.",

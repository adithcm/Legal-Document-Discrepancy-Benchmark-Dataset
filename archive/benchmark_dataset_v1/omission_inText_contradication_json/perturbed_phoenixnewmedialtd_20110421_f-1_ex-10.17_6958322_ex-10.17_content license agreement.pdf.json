                "changed_text": "1.1 Unless otherwise referenced herein, each of the terms used herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it below:\n\n(i) “Affiliate”, with respect to any Party hereto, shall mean any entity related to a Party. The specific definition of affiliate will be provided on a project by project basis and added to Exhibit 2.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' included specific criteria for determining control. The modified text removes this specificity, stating that the detailed definition will be on project basis and added to exhibit 2, creating uncertainty. The amended clause, by introducing project-specific definitions, creates a contradiction with the general definition, potentially leading to disputes over which definition applies in a given situation. This also create an ambiguity as it is not stated if exhibit 2 exists, and where it could be found.",

(“Phoenix Online”).\n\n4.2 The Parties may enter into a separate agreement and establish specific fee rates in respect of services beyond this Agreement in accordance with the principles set forth herein.",

The terms of payment will be net 30 days upon receipt of invoice.\n\n4.2 The Parties may enter into a separate agreement and establish specific fee rates in respect of services beyond this Agreement in accordance with the principles set forth herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text tied the service fee to 'Attachment 1' of another agreement. The modified text states that the service fee will be at a 'fair market rate.' This creates a contradiction because the 'fair market rate' is undefined. The absence of a clear definition or calculation method for the fair market rate introduces ambiguity and potential disputes regarding the fee amount, especially if the 'Attachment 1' is no longer accessible or applicable. By establishing that the terms of payment will be net 30 days, contradicts any other agreements that could have different payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The original clause stated that each party is responsible for its own taxes. By modifying the tax responsibility to follow 'policies of Party A' introduces a contradiction. If Party A's policies shift the tax burden to Party B without Party B's explicit consent, it contradicts the implied understanding of separate financial responsibility. This change affects the financial obligations of the parties and opens the door to disputes.",

Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any\nindividual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under\ncommon control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\nthe direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of a party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such\nparty.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific definition for 'control,' requiring at least 50% ownership or the right to control policy decisions. By removing this definition, the agreement lacks clarity, especially in later sections regarding non-competition clauses that involve affiliates. This omission introduces uncertainty in enforcing non-competition clauses if the meaning of 'control' is disputed.",

During the 18-month period following the payment by one party\nof any amount due under this Agreement to the other party, the party receiving\npayment (the \"Auditing Party\") shall have the right to have an independent third\nparty (the \"Auditor\") audit the financial records of the other party (the\n\"Audited Party\") relating to such payment to verify the accuracy of the Audited\nParty's financial records in order to verify the amount of the payments owed\nand/or paid. The Auditing Party may cause the Auditor to perform such an audit\nnot more than once in any 12-month period, unless a prior audit within the past\ntwo years revealed that the amount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing\nParty was underpaid in excess of 5% of the amount owed, in which case an audit\nmay be performed no more frequently than once in any three month period. If the\namount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was underpaid, the\nAudited Party shall pay the additional amount owed and all accrued interest\nthereon to the Auditing Party within 15 days of notice of such underpayment to\nthe Audited Party. If the amount owed by' the Audited Party to the Auditing\nParty was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit\nshall also be paid to the Auditing Party within 15 days of notice of such to the\nAudited Party. If the amount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was\noverpaid, the Auditing Party shall return the excess amount paid to the Auditing\nParty within 15 days of notice of such underpayment to the Auditing Party. The\nAuditing Party shall give reasonable advance written notice to the Audited\nParty, and each audit shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a\nmanner that does not cause unreasonable disruption to the conduct of business by\nthe Audited Party.",

                "explanation": "The original audit clause specified conditions for frequency (once in a 12-month period, unless underpayment exceeded 5%) and consequences for under/overpayment including interest and fee obligations. The changed text omits all these specifics, and only specifies that an audit can occur. This would be an internal contradiction if the contract mentioned the consequences somewhere else.",

By removing these specifics, a general 'material breach' clause is left. This creates ambiguity.

                "explanation": "By removing the references to APPENDIX 2 for defining 'Content' and 'Territory', the contract becomes ambiguous. Later sections still rely on these definitions, creating an internal contradiction as their meaning is no longer clearly established within the main body of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to APPENDIX 2 for defining the 'REVENUES' share leaves the actual percentage unspecified. While the obligation to pay a share remains, the lack of a defined percentage creates uncertainty in enforcement and contradicts the implied understanding that the specific revenue share is documented.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to APPENDIX 2, the duration and conditions of the 'sell-off period' are no longer defined. This omission creates a contradiction because the contract still mentions a sell-off period, implying specific terms, but the terms are no longer provided, leading to ambiguity and potential disputes.",

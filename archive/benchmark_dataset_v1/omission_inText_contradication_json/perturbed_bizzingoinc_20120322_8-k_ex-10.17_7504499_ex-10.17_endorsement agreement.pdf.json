                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "“Property” as stated herein shall mean Theismann’s name (including “Joe Theismann”, “Theismann” “J. Theismann”), nicknames, initials, autograph, facsimile signature, photograph, image, likeness, voice, video portrayals, biographical data, character, symbols, and/or other endorsement, and any variations or deviations thereof.",
                "changed_text": "“Property” as stated herein shall mean Theismann’s likeness and voice.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Property' included a comprehensive list of elements associated with Theismann. The modified definition narrows this down to only 'likeness and voice'. This creates a contradiction because other clauses in the contract still assume a broader definition of 'Property', such as use of the autograph or photograph, which are no longer explicitly covered, creating uncertainty about the scope of Bizzingo's rights.",

                "original_text": "The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty Period during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users, respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The form of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A-l and shall be referred to as the “Royalty Warrant.\"",
                "changed_text": "The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be determined by Bizzingo's board of directors.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the royalty payments are determined by the number of Activated Users. The modified text states that royalty payments are determined by Bizzingo's board of directors. This creates an in-text contradiction by omitting the clear indicator for how royalties are calculated in the original text. This means that when looking back at the Royalty payments due in Section 3, the method of calculation of Scheduled A conflicts with the discretion given to the Bizzingo board of directors.",

                "original_text": "Following the execution of this Agreement, Theismann will provide Bizzingo with an availability schedule indicating black out and/or available dates and from time to time will endeavor to update such schedule. In this regard, Bizzingo agrees to provide Joseph Theismann with at least thirty (30) days' written notice of any photographic sessions or public appearances to permit Theismann to properly schedule the session or appearance. Bizzingo will pay all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by Theismann in connection with such session or appearance which expenses shall not exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per day unless Theismann receives prior written approval from Bizzingo. For any travel incurred by Theismann as part of his appearances, Bizzingo will provide first class air travel and hotel accommodations.",

Bizzingo will pay all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by Theismann in connection with such session or appearance.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides specific details about notice periods, expense limits, and travel accommodations for promotional appearances. The modified version removes the thirty-day notice requirement, the $1,000 expense limit, and the details of first-class travel accommodations. While Section 4 still references 'Promotional Appearances' the omitted details leave open how much notice Theismann should be given, whether there is a limit to expenses, and travel accommodations.",

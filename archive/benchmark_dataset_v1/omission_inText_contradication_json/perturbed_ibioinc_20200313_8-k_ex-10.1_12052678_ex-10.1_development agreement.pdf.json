Each Product will be set forth in a separate Statement of Work in the form set forth in Appendix A, which will be signed by representatives of each Party with signing authority. Each phase of the project(s) will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement unless otherwise provided for or in a Statement of Work (“SOW”), including but not limited to project purpose, project phases, and a project budget.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'Each Product will be set forth in a separate Statement of Work in the form set forth in Appendix A, which will be signed by representatives of each Party with signing authority' an in-text contradiction is created. Later sections will reference a Statement of Work and Appendix A, but there's no longer a contractual obligation to create them for *each product*. This leads to ambiguity in determining the scope of licensed activities for each specific product, creating uncertainty for enforcement.",

Due upon presentation of deliverables to be negotiated.\n3.1.3 Final payment, amount to be determined, due upon final project deliverables.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific payment amounts and detailed deliverables tied to each payment introduces ambiguity and contradiction. While the section still mandates payments, the lack of defined sums and deliverables makes it impossible to enforce the original payment structure. Later sections might reference the payments related to deliverables but those deliverables are changed to 'deliverables to be negotiated', creating a contradiction and uncertainty in financial obligations.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'for five (5) years from the date of disclosure' and modifying 'same care and discretion to avoid disclosure, publication or dissemination outside of those employees and contractors as the receiving Party does with similar information of its own which it does not desire to publish, disclose or disseminate' to 'reasonable care to avoid disclosure, publication or dissemination outside of those employees' creates a contradiction about the duration of confidentiality. Section 7.7 indicates 'The parties agree that limitations on disclosure of Confidential information under section 7.3 shall last 5 years from signing date' but that is no longer present in section 7.3. This introduces uncertainty about the scope and enforcement of the confidentiality terms.",

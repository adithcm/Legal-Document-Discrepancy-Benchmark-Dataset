                "changed_text": "Licensor shall provide Rogers with Licensed Programs. The provision of closed captioning is subject to separate negotiation.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for 'commercial reasonable efforts' to provide closed captioning, and stating it's subject to 'separate negotiation,' an inconsistency is created. Section 11 requires complete information regarding closed captioning to be provided to Rogers' GUI/EPG provider, creating a contradiction because Licensor is no longer explicitly obligated to provide content with closed captioning, yet still must provide information about its existence.",

                "changed_text": "In consideration for certain services, Licensor will compensate Rogers as agreed upon in subsequent addenda. Specifics regarding payment schedule are to be determined.",
                "explanation": "The original text in Section 12 explicitly states a 10% marketing allowance calculated on a rolling basis. The modification removes the specific percentage and payment terms, referring to 'subsequent addenda' and 'to be determined.' This creates a contradiction because Section 6(b)(ii)(A) still refers to the 'marketing allowance pursuant to Section 12,' despite Section 12 no longer defining this allowance clearly. This makes enforcement ambiguous because the amount and calculation of the marketing allowance are undefined.",

                "changed_text": "Licensor will support Rogers with copyright royalty payments as mutually determined. The specifics will follow standard industry practices.",
                "explanation": "By changing from 'reimburse Rogers for 50%' to 'support Rogers with copyright royalty payments as mutually determined,' the specific financial obligation is removed. Section 6(b)(ii)(C) refers to 'copyright royalty payments pursuant to Section 17.' Now Section 17 no longer contains a clear calculation method creating an ambiguity and contradiction.",

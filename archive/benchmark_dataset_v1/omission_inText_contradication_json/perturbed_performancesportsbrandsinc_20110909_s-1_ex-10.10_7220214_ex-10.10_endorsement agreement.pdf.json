                "explanation": "By removing wedges and putters from the definition of \"Endorsed Product(s)\", there is a contradiction in section 6a, where it requires North to use F2 branded wedges. This omission creates confusion as wedges are no longer strictly under the agreement of \"Endorsed Product(s)\".",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific percentage for the late charge, section 7.f now contradicts other sections which may reference timely payments and remedies for non-payment based on a defined late charge. It creates ambiguity on how much the late charge is.",

Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Amendment will have the meaning set forth for that term in the Non-Competition Agreement or the Master Framework Agreement, dated September 30, 2016, by and between the Parties (the “Master Framework Agreement”).",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the Non-Competition Agreement and Master Framework Agreement for definitions, the amendment creates ambiguity. Later sections might still rely on terms defined in those original agreements, leading to conflicting interpretations. For example, if 'Confidential Information' was previously rigorously defined, this change introduces uncertainty and potential disputes.",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales\nTerm” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar\nDeveloper, LLC (the “Term”).”",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the “Sales Term” as defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement, the amendment introduces ambiguity about the duration of the non-solicitation agreement. The original text links it to a specific, potentially longer, term in another agreement. This could create an internal contradiction if the Sales Dealer Agreement extends beyond one year, yet this agreement is set for only one year, and provisions like 5 reference the same agreement.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment is governed by general principles of contract law.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to the Master Framework Agreement's Sections 4 and 6, the amendment creates uncertainty about whether those specific clauses (Confidentiality, Miscellaneous) still apply. If other sections of this amendment rely on the specifics detailed in those sections of the master agreement, they may now be unenforceable due to the lack of explicit incorporation, because the other sections rely on the Master Framework Agreement for guidance.",

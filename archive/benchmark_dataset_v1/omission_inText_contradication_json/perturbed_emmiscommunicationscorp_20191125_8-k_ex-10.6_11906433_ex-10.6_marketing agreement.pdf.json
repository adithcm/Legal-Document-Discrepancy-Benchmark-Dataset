                "original_text": "1. Agreement Term. The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) will begin on the date hereof (the “Commencement Date”), and will continue until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2022, (ii) the termination or expiration of the Studio Lease (defined below), (iii) election to terminate and notice thereof given by Programmer to Licensee, and (iv) mutual written consent of Licensee and Programmer (the “Term”), unless extended or earlier terminated pursuant to Section 11 hereof. The term “Studio Lease” means that certain Lease dated as of February 23, 1996 of certain real estate located on the 7th Floor of an office building located at 395 Hudson St., New York, New York.",
                "changed_text": "1. Agreement Term. The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) will begin on the date hereof (the “Commencement Date”), and will continue indefinitely, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 11 hereof. The term “Studio Lease” means that certain Lease dated as of February 23, 1996 of certain real estate located on the 7th Floor of an office building located at 395 Hudson St., New York, New York.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a definitive end date for the agreement, along with other termination conditions. The modified text removes the specific end date (December 31, 2022) and other termination clauses based on the 'Studio Lease', making the agreement indefinite unless terminated under Section 11. This creates a contradiction, as the agreement now implies potentially perpetual continuation, yet it still retains a clause about 'termination' via Section 11, implying the agreement isn't actually perpetual. This change creates uncertainty about the intended duration of the agreement and what occurs upon expiration of the studio lease.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement Licensee will have full authority, power and control over the operation of the Station, including the HD2 Channel, and over all persons working at the Station’s facilities during the Term. Licensee will bear the responsibility for the Station’s compliance with all applicable provisions of the rules and policies of the FCC. Nothing contained herein shall prevent Licensee from (a) rejecting or refusing programs which Licensee believes to be contrary to the public interest, or (b) substituting programs which Licensee believes to be of greater local or national importance or which are designed to address the problems, needs and interests of the local communities. Licensee reserves the right to refuse to broadcast any WLIB Program containing matter which violates any right of any third party or which constitutes a personal attack. Licensee also reserves the right to refuse to broadcast any WLIB Program which does not meet the requirements of the rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC or the regulations and restrictions set forth in Section 8. Licensee further reserves the right to preempt any WLIB Program in the event of a local, state, or national emergency. Licensee agrees that its right of preemption shall not be exercised in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, or for commercial advantage. Licensee reserves the right to delete any commercial announcements that do not comply with the requirements of the FCC’s sponsorship identification policy. Programmer will immediately serve Licensee with notice and a copy of any letters of complaint it receives concerning any WLIB Program for Licensee review. Licensee’s rights under this Section 6 and its decisions regarding whether to exercise such rights in any particular circumstance shall not in any way affect Programmer’s obligations under Section 12 hereunder. Pursuant to Note 2 to Section 73.3555 of the FCC’s rules, Licensee certifies that it maintains ultimate control over WQHT(FM)’s finances, personnel and programming, and Programmer certifies that this Agreement complies with Section 73.3555(b) of the FCC’s rules.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides detailed criteria for Licensee to reject WLIB Programs (public interest, third-party rights, FCC compliance, emergencies). The modified text removes these specific criteria, replacing them with a vague 'inappropriate' standard. This creates a contradiction because while the Licensee still has the 'right' to reject broadcast, the specific basis for doing so has been significantly altered. This impacts Licensee's liabilities and programmers ability to know whether what they provide conforms with the new standard.",

Licensee shall oversee and take ultimate responsibility with respect to the provision of equal opportunities, lowest unit charge, and reasonable access to political candidates, and compliance with the political broadcast rules of the FCC. During the Term, Programmer shall cooperate with Licensee as Licensee complies with its political broadcast responsibilities, and shall supply such information promptly to Licensee as may be necessary to comply with the political advertising time record keeping, reasonable access, and lowest unit charge requirements of federal law.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with FCC rules and regulations, creating a legally enforceable standard. The modified text replaces this with a subjective standard ('entertaining'), eliminating the concrete requirement to follow FCC regulations. However, the paragraph on Political Time still references FCC rules. This creates a contradiction: the general programming is no longer explicitly bound by FCC rules, but political broadcasts still are. The omission of 'compliance to FCC rules' in 8.1 causes 8.2 to contradict this by referencing those same regulations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit list of products constituting 'Licensed Products', the contract becomes vague. Section Four still references specific products (BlackMP Living Water, etc.) and their 'Unit' values for donation calculations, but the definition of 'Licensed Products' no longer includes them specifically. This creates an internal contradiction about which products are subject to the donation agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of units in section four, the term 'per Unit' becomes ambiguous and unenforceable.

                "explanation": "By removing the term 'Licensed Products' from this sentence, there is no indication of which sales will be reported. This omission undermines the NFLA-NC's ability to verify donations from the sales of the defined products. Furthermore, because 'Licensed Products' is referenced throughout the document in relation to donations, this lack of specificity makes it difficult to enforce any of the contractual obligations.",

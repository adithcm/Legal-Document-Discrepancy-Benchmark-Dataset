                "explanation": "The relocation of the governing law clause buries a critical legal provision within a section primarily concerned with disclaimers of warranty. This makes it more difficult for a party to quickly ascertain which jurisdiction's laws govern the contract, thus reducing its clarity and potentially its enforceability, as it might be overlooked during a dispute.",

As soon as practicable, but no later than twenty (20) days after the Effective Date, the Parties\nshall form a joint steering committee (“JSC”) whose responsibilities during the Term shall be to oversee the activities set forth in\nSection 3.3. The JSC shall consist of three (3) representatives from each Party, each with suitable seniority and relevant experience\nand expertise to enable such person to address matters falling within the purview of the JSC. From time to time, each Party may\nchange any of its representatives on the JSC by giving written notice to the other Party. The meetings of the JSC will be chaired by\na representative from Dova or Valeant, on an alternating basis. The JSC shall determine a meeting schedule; provided, that, in any\nevent, meetings shall be conducted no less frequently than quarterly by teleconference or in person, or as otherwise agreed by the\nParties. In person meetings shall occur at such places as mutually agreed by the Parties. Employees or consultants of either Party\nthat are not representatives of the Parties on the JSC may attend meetings of the JSC; provided, that such attendees (i) shall not\nparticipate in the decision-making process of the JSC, and (ii) are bound by obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure\nequivalent to those set forth in ARTICLE 9.\n\n4.3 Compliance with Applicable Law.\n4.3.1 In conducting the Valeant Activities hereunder, Valeant shall, and shall require all Field Force Personnel to,\ncomply in all respects with Applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "Moving Valeant's responsibility to comply with laws to a section on the Joint Steering Committee subtly obscures its importance.  Compliance is a fundamental aspect of the contract and should be easily located, not buried within the operational details of a committee.",

Promptly following receipt by\nValeant of such list, but no later than [***] after receipt of the list of Target Professionals, Valeant may present to Dova a list of\nTarget Professionals that, acting in good faith, it reasonably believes have a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently\npractice in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology. For greater certainty, this list may include, but not\nbe limited to, Target Professionals with a primary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and\na secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, for which Valeant wishes to confirm the primary specialty.\n\n5.7 Certain Reporting Responsibilities.

                "explanation": "The movement of Section 5.7, which outlines responsibilities related to government pricing and payment transparency reporting under laws like the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, to Section 6.5 significantly impairs its visibility. This clause is directly related to compliance with transparency laws, and its relocation to a section focusing on the 'Determination of Specialty' (related to identifying target professionals) makes it less likely to be noticed by those responsible for ensuring compliance with reporting requirements, potentially resulting in oversights or non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "The phrase '(infringement shall include, but is not limited to, direct, contributory, or inducement to infringe)' is removed, creating ambiguity. It is now unclear if other forms of infringement beyond direct infringement are included, leading to uncertainty in enforcement regarding indirect infringement.",

These new terms are not defined in the DEFINITIONS (Section 2), so it is unclear if they have the same meaning as the original terms. The contract now uses similar but undefined words. It creates uncertainty in the payment calculations. For example, are royalties paid on all DELIVERABLES/TASKS, or only PRODUCT(S)/SERVICE(S)?",

                "explanation": "Here, 'LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and LICENSED SERVICE(S)' is replaced in some places with 'TECHNOLOGY'. While 'TECHNOLOGY' might be implied, it is never explicitly defined. Elsewhere in the same paragraph, the terms 'LICENSED PRODUCT(S)' and 'LICENSED SERVICE(S)' remain. This inconsistency creates confusion as to which actions trigger the indemnification obligation. Does the indemnification only apply if unlicensed technology is used, or if licensed PRODUCTS and SERVICES are used, or both? This creates an internal contradiction within the contract.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Transporter' to 'Carrier' and 'Shipper' to 'Customer' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear if Carrier and Transporter, or Customer and Shipper refer to the same entity, potentially affecting obligations and rights outlined in subsequent sections.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Shipper' has now been changed to 'Customer', and 'Transporter' to 'Provider' in this section, creating confusion as to which entities are being referred. This contradicts the initial definitions (or lack thereof after modification) and makes rate determination ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "In this clause, 'Shipper' is replaced with 'Customer' and 'Transporter' with 'Carrier', while the rest of the agreement might still use the old terms in other sections. Now, it's not clear whether the obligations of 'Shipper' and 'Transporter' mentioned elsewhere are also governed by this provision, creating ambiguity about post-termination liabilities and enforcement.",

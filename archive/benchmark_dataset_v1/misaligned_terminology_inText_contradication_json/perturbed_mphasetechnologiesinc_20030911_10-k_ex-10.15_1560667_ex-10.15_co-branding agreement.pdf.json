                "explanation": "By changing 'party' to 'organization' and 'other party' to 'other entity', we introduce ambiguity. Are 'organization' and 'entity' meant to be synonymous with the original definition of 'Party,' or do they introduce a new, undefined meaning? This affects the legal obligations for termination.",

The change to 'person' from 'party' creates doubt on whether this limitation of liability applies to Lucent and mPhase at all. The definition refers to organizations.",

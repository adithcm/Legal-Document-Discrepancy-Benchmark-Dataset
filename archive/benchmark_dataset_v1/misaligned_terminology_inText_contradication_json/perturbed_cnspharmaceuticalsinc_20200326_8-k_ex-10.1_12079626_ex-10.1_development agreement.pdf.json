                "explanation": "The contract uses 'Net Sales' in Section 1.8 and redefines 'Development Fee' based on 'Gross Revenue'. This is problematic because Net Sales is defined in reference to the Sublicense Agreement, creating an inconsistency.",

In exchange for the payment by WPD of the Development Fee to CNS, CNS hereby agrees to pay WPD the following payments: (i) within thirty Business Days from the date of this Agreement, CNS will make an upfront payment of $225,000 to WPD; and (ii) within thirty days of the verified achievement of the Phase II Milestone, (such verification shall be conducted by an independent third party mutually acceptable to the parties hereto), CNS will make a payment of $775,000 to WPD.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'Development Fee' to 'Remuneration Fee' in this context, without defining 'Remuneration Fee,' an ambiguity is introduced. It creates doubt as to whether 'Development Fee', as it is defined in Section 1.5, is separate and distinct or is being used synonymously with 'Remuneration Fee'.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'comply' with 'adhere' and 'governmental entities' with 'governmental bodies' introduces a subtle but significant change. 'Adhere' implies a weaker level of compliance compared to 'comply,' potentially creating ambiguity about the required rigor. Similarly, 'governmental bodies' is less precise than 'governmental entities'.",

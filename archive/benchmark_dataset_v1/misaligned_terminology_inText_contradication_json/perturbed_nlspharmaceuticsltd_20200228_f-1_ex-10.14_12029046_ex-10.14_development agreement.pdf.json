                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'agreed by Licensor' from the definition of 'Distributor', the contract introduces ambiguity. In other sections (e.g., 2.2), the need for Licensor agreement might still be implied, creating uncertainty about the Licensee’s autonomy in choosing distributors.",

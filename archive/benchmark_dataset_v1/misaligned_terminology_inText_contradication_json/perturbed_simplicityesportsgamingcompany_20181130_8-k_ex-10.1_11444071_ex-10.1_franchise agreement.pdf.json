                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Franchisor desires to appoint Franchisee, and Franchisee desires to be so appointed, to act as Franchisor’s exclusive Franchisee in the territories of North America and South America (“Territory”) in the manner set out in this Agreement, for setting up, managing and operating entertainment centres and gaming arcades involving virtual reality, sports simulation technology and proprietary gamification technologies to provide sport and recreational activities/services to the public (“Smaaash Centres”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter provided.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Franchisor desires to appoint Franchisee, and Franchisee desires to be so appointed, to act as Franchisor’s exclusive Licensee in the territories of North America and South America (“Territory”) in the manner set out in this Agreement, for setting up, managing and operating entertainment centres and gaming arcades involving virtual reality, sports simulation technology and proprietary gamification technologies to provide sport and recreational activities/services to the public (“Smaaash Centres”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter provided.",
                "explanation": "The agreement initially defines the relationship as Franchisor and Franchisee. By changing 'Franchisee' to 'Licensee' in this section, the nature of the relationship becomes unclear, leading to potential disputes over rights, obligations, and revenue sharing as these are typically different between a franchisee and a licensee.",

Franchisee shall perform its obligations hereunder without using subcontractors, sub-distributors, independent sales representatives, agents, Franchisee’s affiliates or other non-employees (“Third Parties”) to perform the obligations of Franchisee under this Agreement except to the contrary specifically stated in this Agreement or unless they have been approved, in writing, in advance, by Franchisor, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Franchisee' to 'Contractor' introduces confusion regarding who is bound by this obligation. Is it the Franchisee or an entirely different entity called the 'Contractor?' This ambiguity impacts enforcement of the 'no Third Parties' clause.",

The indemnification rights of the Franchisor shall be without prejudice to, and independent of any other rights and remedies that the Franchisor may have at law or in equity, including the right to seek specific performance, injunctive relief or restitution, none of which rights or remedies shall be affected or diminished thereby. The provisions of this Section 7.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensee shall indemnify and hold the Franchisor, its affiliates and their respective agents and employees harmless from all claims, actions, suits, damages, costs and expenses in relation to or arising out of the breach of any representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Franchisee as set out in this Agreement. The indemnification rights of the Franchisor shall be without prejudice to, and independent of any other rights and remedies that the Franchisor may have at law or in equity, including the right to seek specific performance, injunctive relief or restitution, none of which rights or remedies shall be affected or diminished thereby. The provisions of this Section 7.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Referring to the indemnifying party as 'Licensee' while stating the obligations are those of the 'Franchisee' creates a direct contradiction. It's unclear who is actually responsible for the indemnity, as obligations for the Franchisee are specified, but the 'Licensee' is now bearing those obligations. This weakens the indemnification clause due to the uncertainty.",

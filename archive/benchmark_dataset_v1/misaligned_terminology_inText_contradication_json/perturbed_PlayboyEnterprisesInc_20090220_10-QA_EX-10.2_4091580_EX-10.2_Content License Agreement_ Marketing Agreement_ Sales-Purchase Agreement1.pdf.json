                "explanation": "The original text uses 'Catalogs' and 'Websites' which are collectively referred to as the 'Playboy Commerce Business'. The modified version replaces these terms with 'Playboy Printed Media' and 'Digital Platforms', collectively 'Playboy Business Ventures'. This creates confusion as it is now unclear whether 'Playboy Business Ventures' includes the same elements as 'Playboy Commerce Business', especially regarding obligations tied to each term in later sections.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Websites' is changed to 'Digital Platforms', but then the agreement also mentions 'All Advertisements on the Websites'. Because the initial definitions in the file are contradictary, it makes it difficult to know the extent of both of the terms. Thus, it becomes unclear whether the obligation pertains specifically to the Digital Platforms and Websites or if the scope is actually different from the original intent.",

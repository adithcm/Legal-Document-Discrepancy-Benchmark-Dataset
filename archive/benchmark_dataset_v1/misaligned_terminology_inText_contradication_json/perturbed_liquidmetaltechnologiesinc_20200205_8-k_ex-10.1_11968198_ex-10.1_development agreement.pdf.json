                "explanation": "The contract inconsistently refers to Liquidmetal and Eutectix collectively as both 'Parties' and 'Vendors.' This creates confusion because 'Vendor' is not explicitly defined, and it becomes unclear whether the obligations and rights assigned to the 'Parties' also apply to them as 'Vendors.' This is in direct contradiction to the defined term.",

Payment terms are net 30 days after the date of the invoice, or the date of receipt by Liquidmetal of the invoice if the invoice is received more than 10 days after the date of the invoice. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",

Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Entities, payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Parties' to 'Entities' introduces confusion. While 'Parties' is defined, 'Entities' is not. This raises questions as to whether 'Entities' refers only to Liquidmetal and Eutectix, or if it encompasses other affiliated or unrelated entities. This leads to uncertainty about payment agreements.",

                "explanation": "Substituting 'Product' with 'Items' creates ambiguity regarding acceptance criteria. 'Liquidmetal Product' is reasonably well-defined, whereas 'Liquidmetal Items' is not defined at all. It's unclear whether 'Items' includes components, raw materials, or something else entirely. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether the acceptance clause applies to individual components or only the finished product.",

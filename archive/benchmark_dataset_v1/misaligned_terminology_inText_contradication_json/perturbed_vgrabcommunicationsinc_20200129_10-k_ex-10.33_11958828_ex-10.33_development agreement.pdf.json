(hereinafter called as the “VAL”), located at Room E, 6th Floor, Eastern Commercial Center, 397 Hennessy Road, Hong Kong.\nAND:\nMr. Zheng Qing, Mr. Gu Xianwin and Ms. Chen Weijie (hereinafter called as the \"Software Provider\"), a group\nof private software developers individuals’ lead and coordinated by Ms. Chen Weijie with its operations in\nP.R.China.\nAnd hereinafter, the parties hereto shall be referred to as “Party” or “Parties”.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Developer' is changed to 'Software Provider'. While seemingly synonymous, this introduces ambiguity as 'Developer' has specific implications related to code creation and maintenance as outlined in the agreement. Using 'Software Provider' opens the possibility that their role is broader and less defined, potentially impacting liability for bugs and ongoing support responsibilities as detailed later in the document.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Developer' to 'Service Provider' in this context significantly alters the responsibility. The original text explicitly states the 'Developer' is 'responsible and liable' for business compliance. The modified version states that the 'Software Provider' only 'advises' on business compliance. This creates a contradiction because the responsibilities are not the same and dilutes the 'Service Provider' responsibilities compared to those of the 'Developer'.",

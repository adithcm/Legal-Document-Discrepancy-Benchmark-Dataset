                "explanation": "The terms 'purchase' and 'procure' are used interchangeably, however, they have different meanings, which can cause confusion regarding ownership and liability. 'Purchase' implies a transfer of ownership and associated risks, whereas 'procure' can imply simply obtaining or acquiring something, which does not necessarily mean ownership. This can cause a contradiction of which party takes title.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'keep' and 'maintain' are used interchangeably. 'Keep' implies a state of preservation, whereas 'maintain' implies regular attention and upkeep, which could include updating and correcting.

                "explanation": "The terms 'right' and 'authority' are used interchangeably. While they can be similar, in legal contexts, 'right' often refers to a legal or moral entitlement, while 'authority' refers to a power or permission to act. Using them interchangeably creates a subtle difference, and possible contradiction in the scope of control over the Recall Action. One suggests a foundational claim and the other a derivative permission.",

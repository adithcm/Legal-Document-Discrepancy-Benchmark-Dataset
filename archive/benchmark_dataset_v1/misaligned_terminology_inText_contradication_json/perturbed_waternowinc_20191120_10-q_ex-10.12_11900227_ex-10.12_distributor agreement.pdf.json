                "original_text": "Hydraspin hereby appoints Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts appointment, as Hydraspin’s exclusive distributor of the Products in the Territory during the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks. The Territory may be amended with the mutual agreement of both Parties from time to time to add or delete geographic territories by amending Exhibit B attached hereto.",
                "changed_text": "Hydraspin hereby appoints Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts appointment, as Hydraspin’s exclusive sales representative of the Products in the Territory during the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmarks. The Territory may be amended with the mutual agreement of both Parties from time to time to add or delete geographic territories by amending Exhibit B attached hereto.",
                "explanation": "By using 'sales representative' instead of 'distributor,' it creates an ambiguity about the scope of the Distributor's authority and responsibilities. A distributor typically buys and resells products, assuming more risk and control, while a sales representative acts as an agent, earning commission without ownership. This change introduces uncertainty in the business relationship and enforcement, particularly around inventory ownership and pricing control.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by implying that the 'Customer' is a direct purchaser from Hydraspin, while the agreement is for exclusive distribution through the Distributor. It confuses the role of the Distributor by directly selling to Hydraspin customers.",

The requested delivery date shall be no less than 120 days from the date the Order is accepted by Hydraspin. Hydraspin will not unreasonably reject any Order for Products. Hydraspin will accept or reject each Order submitted by Distributor within ten (10) days after receipt of the Order.",

The requested delivery date shall be no less than 120 days from the date the Request is acknowledged by Hydraspin. Hydraspin may unreasonably reject any Request for Products. Hydraspin will acknowledge each Request submitted by Distributor within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Request.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear process for ordering Products, including the obligation for Hydraspin to not unreasonably reject orders. By changing 'order' to 'request', and allowing Hydraspin to 'unreasonably reject' the request, it makes fulfillment uncertain for the distributor.",

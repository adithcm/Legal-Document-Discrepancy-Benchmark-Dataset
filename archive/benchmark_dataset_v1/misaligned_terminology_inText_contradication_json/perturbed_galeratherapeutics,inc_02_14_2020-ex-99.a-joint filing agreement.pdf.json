Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the “Regulations”) the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A.

                "explanation": "Changing “Exchange Act” to “Regulations” and “filing” to “submission”, “party” to “entity”, “rule” to “code”, “amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit” to “adjustment, rewrite, annex, and/or display”, “securities” to “shares”, and “Agreement” to “Concordance” introduces ambiguity. The terms used are now inconsistent and undefined. It is unclear if 'Regulations' refers to the same legal framework as 'Exchange Act'.",

'Accountable' and 'prompt submission' further obscure the original obligations related to the legally defined 'filing'.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Agreement' with 'Concordance,' 'full force and effect' with 'absolute validity and operation,' 'revoked' with 'canceled,' 'party' with 'signatory,' 'signed writing' with 'noted communication,' and 'revoking party' with 'terminating signatory' obscures the legal meaning of the clause. It is now unclear if 'Concordance' has the same binding effect as the original 'Agreement,' making its enforceability ambiguous.",

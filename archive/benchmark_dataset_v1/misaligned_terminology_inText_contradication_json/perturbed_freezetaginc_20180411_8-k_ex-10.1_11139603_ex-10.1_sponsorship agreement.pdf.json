                "original_text": "This Agreement (\"Agreement\") is made effective March 22, 2018, by and between Freeze Tag Inc., a Delaware Corporation\n(\"Company\"), with its principal place of business located at 1720 Bray Central Drive, McKinney, TX 75069 and the American\nDiabetes Association, Inc. (\"Association\"), an Ohio not-for profit corporation, with its principal place of business located at 2451\nCrystal Drive, Suite 900, Arlington, VA 22202.

ADA and/or Company may be referred to as a “Party” or alternately as the “Individual.”",
                "explanation": "The change from \"Parties\" to \"Individual\" introduces ambiguity.  If 'Party' and 'Individual' are used interchangeably, it suggests that either ADA or Company can be referred to as 'Individual,' contradicting the plural form 'Parties' when referring to both together. This creates uncertainty about which provisions apply to a single entity versus both.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"services\" to \"deliverables\" creates confusion. Attachment A details services provided. Switching to 'deliverables' implies a tangible product, whereas the agreement outlines promotional activities and acknowledgements. This could lead to disputes regarding the scope of the company's obligation: are they providing a service or a product?",

                "explanation": "The change from \"samples\" to \"specimens\" alters the intent. 'Samples' suggests representative examples of production items. 'Specimens,' implies items that are for display or examination, not necessarily representative of the bulk or quality. This change could create uncertainty regarding whether Company only needs to provide display copies instead of actual market-ready products.",

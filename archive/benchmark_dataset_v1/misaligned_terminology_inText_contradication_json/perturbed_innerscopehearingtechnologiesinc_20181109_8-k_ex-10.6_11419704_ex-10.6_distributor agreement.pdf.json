(“Erchonia”) whose address\nis 650 Atlantis Rd., Melbourne, Florida, USA, 32904 and InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc, (“Distributor”)\nwhose address is 2151 Professional Drive, Second Floor, Roseville, California, USA, 95661 hereafter referred to\ncollectively as the (“Parties”).",

                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' is a key term that defines the role of InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc. Replacing it with 'Recipient' creates confusion about the actual role and responsibilities of InnerScope throughout the agreement. Is InnerScope a distributor or just a recipient of products?",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Distributor' is replaced with 'Marketer' in the first sentence of section 1a. This creates ambiguity in the agreement because InnerScope is later referred to as 'Distributor,' and both terms are now used. This inconsistency is problematic and introduces confusion by implying two separate roles.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Distributor' with 'InnerScope' in the first part of the sentence, while keeping 'Distributor' in the remainder of the sentence, leads to confusion. The sentence implies that Erchonia will protect InnerScope from liabilities of the Distributor. Given the agreement defines InnerScope as the Distributor, it could be unclear who is responsible for which actions. Also, it would be unclear who's liable for claims made.",

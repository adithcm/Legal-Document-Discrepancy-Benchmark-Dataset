                "explanation": "The term 'Parties' is changed to 'Contracting Parties' without a clear definition, making it ambiguous whether it encompasses only Business Affiliate and UDC or includes other entities later in the agreement. This creates confusion regarding who is bound by the agreement's terms.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Party' with 'Signatory' introduces a contradiction. While 'Party' is defined in the preamble (although perturbed in the previous entry), 'Signatory' is undefined. This raises uncertainty about whether obligations apply only to those who physically signed or extend to Business Affiliate's employees or subcontractors mentioned later.",

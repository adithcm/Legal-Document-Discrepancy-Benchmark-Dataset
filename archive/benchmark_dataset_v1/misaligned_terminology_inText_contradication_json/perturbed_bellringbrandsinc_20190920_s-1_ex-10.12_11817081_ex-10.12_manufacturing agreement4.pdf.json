                "original_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective as of July 3, 2019 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”). Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.”",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective as of July 3, 2019 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”). Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Signatories.”",
                "explanation": "The term 'Parties' is replaced with 'Signatories', introducing inconsistency. While generally similar, 'Parties' implies obligations and rights throughout the entire agreement, whereas 'Signatories' might be interpreted more narrowly, referring only to those who signed the agreement. This can lead to disputes about who is bound by the agreement's terms, especially if there are subsequent amendments or assignments.",

                "explanation": "The words 'terms, conditions, and covenants' are replaced by 'stipulations, conditions, and agreements.' While seemingly synonymous, 'covenants' has a specific legal meaning related to promises within a contract. Replacing it with 'agreements' potentially broadens the scope, but also introduces ambiguity as to whether informal agreements outside the original 'Agreement' are now included. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability and interpretation of different promises made by both parties.",

                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Heritage and Premier initiated the Understanding;",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Agreement' with 'Understanding' introduces ambiguity regarding the formal legal status of the arrangement between Heritage and Premier. 'Agreement' implies a binding contract, while 'Understanding' suggests a less formal or legally enforceable arrangement. This difference could affect the interpretation of the parties' obligations and rights under the document.",

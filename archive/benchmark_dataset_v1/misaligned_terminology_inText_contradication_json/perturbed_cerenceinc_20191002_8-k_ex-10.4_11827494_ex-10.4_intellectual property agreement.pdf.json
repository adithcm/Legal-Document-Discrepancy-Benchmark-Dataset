                "explanation": "Here, 'SpinCo Group' is changed to 'SpinCo Division' and 'Nuance Group' to 'Nuance Unit'. The term 'Group' has a specific meaning defined elsewhere in the document, referring to a collection of entities. Using 'Division' and 'Unit' creates ambiguity as it's unclear if those terms are subsets of the Group, or entirely different entities, leading to confusion about who the license extends to.",

                "explanation": "Here 'another party' is changed to 'another entity' and 'member of the Nuance Group' to 'subsidiary of the Nuance Group'. 'Party' is specifically defined to mean Nuance or SpinCo. Replacing it with 'entity' broadens the scope, and now its unclear if the restriction applies only to the specific Parties to the agreement or to any other entity. Furthermore, 'member' and 'subsidiary' have different legal meanings, and it isn't clearly defined that Nuance or SpinCo are subsidiaries or even members of a group. This creates confusion about who the protections extend to.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Party' is changed to 'Company', but Company is never specifically defined in the context of the sentence, which causes confusion. By changing the term like this, it creates uncertainty around which entity can grant the license. It's unclear whether a license granted by a division, unit or an affiliated organization outside of Nuance and SpinCo would fall within this purview.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'We, Our, Us' initially refers to 'Lutheran Brotherhood Variable Insurance Products Company' but is later updated to 'Thrivent Financial for Lutherans'. In the definition, lower case 'we, our, us' are used for Thrivent Financial, while later in the same section it uses uppercase. This inconsistency introduces uncertainty regarding which entity is responsible for specific obligations under the contract. Are both of them responsible or just Thrivent?",

                "explanation": "Here, the 'bylaws' are replaced with 'company policies,' creating confusion on what rules govern the transfer of ownership. More importantly, membership rights are first restricted and then potentially permitted to be transferred, creating an internal contradiction and enforcement uncertainty. This is due to an unclarified process for approval and eligibility for this exception.",

                "explanation": "The change swaps 'the Company' and 'the company' to 'the Society' and 'the Society' respectively, and 'A Stock Life Insurance Company' to 'A Fraternal Benefit Society.' This creates a contradiction because the contract initially implied the organization operated as a Stock Life Insurance Company, but now implies it is a Fraternal Benefit Society. This can impact regulatory compliance, taxation, and member rights under the contract.",

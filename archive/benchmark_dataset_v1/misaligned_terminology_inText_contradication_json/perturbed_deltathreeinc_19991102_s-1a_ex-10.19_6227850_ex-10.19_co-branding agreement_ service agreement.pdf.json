                "explanation": "The terms 'confidential proprietary information' and 'trade secrets' are used interchangeably. 'Trade secrets' have a very specific legal definition with requirements for maintaining that status. Using both terms creates ambiguity as to what information is actually protected, potentially weakening the confidentiality provision, because the specific term 'trade secrets' has more legal requirements.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the level of customer service shall be subject to the approval of DeltaThree.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'customer service' to 'client relations' introduces ambiguity. While related, these terms can imply different levels of service and relationship management. The text doesn't define if these terms are equivalent, creating confusion as to the exact scope of the outsourced services and reimbursement obligations. The last sentence retains 'customer service' to further compound the confusion.",

                "changed_text": "PrimeCall may transfer this Agreement to any subsidiary of PrimeCall or in connection with a merger or consolidation of PrimeCall or a sale of all or substantially all of PrimeCall's assets. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this Agreement may not be assigned by PrimeCall without the prior written consent of DeltaThree.",
                "explanation": "The original text refers to an 'assignment' of the agreement and an 'affiliate' of Primecall. The modified text refers to an 'assignment' of the agreement and a 'subsidiary' of Primecall and a 'transfer' of the agreement and 'assets'. 'Assignment' and 'transfer' can have different legal implications, and the difference between 'affiliate' and 'subsidiary' are also important. Ambiguity is added by stating it may be 'transfered' to a 'subsidiary', yet it can only be 'assigned' with prior written consent, which is only stated in the second sentence. Also, 'assets' implies something very different than 'business'.",

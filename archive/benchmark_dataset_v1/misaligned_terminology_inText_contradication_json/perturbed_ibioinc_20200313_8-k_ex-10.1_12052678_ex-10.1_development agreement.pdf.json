                "explanation": "The contract initially defines iBio Inc. and CC-Pharming Ltd. as \"Parties\". Changing this to \"Contractors\" introduces confusion, as \"Party\" is used consistently throughout the document, and \"Contractor\" is not defined or used elsewhere. This creates ambiguity regarding the rights and responsibilities of each entity, especially concerning clauses that refer specifically to 'Parties'.",

Any modifications to the overall scope of work of phase of the SOW must be reduced to writing as an amendment to the SOW and signed by authorized representatives of iBio and CC-Pharming.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to \"Agreement Administrators\" which are defined previously in section 2.2. By changing \"Agreement Administrators\" to \"Coordinators\" in this section, the contract introduces uncertainty as to who has the authority to make changes to the tasks, task responsibilities, and milestones. 'Coordinators' are mentioned in 2.1 as 'Project Technical Coordinators' which have different responsibilities. Thus, it is not clear if the Project Technical Coordinators have the ability to change the scope of work.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states 'iBio's Technology' in a context requiring confidentiality. By changing 'iBio's Technology' to 'iBio's Intellectual Property', the scope of confidential information is significantly broadened without a clear definition of what constitutes 'Intellectual Property' in this context. This creates ambiguity regarding what information CC-Pharming is obligated to protect, and if CC-Pharming fails to protect specific data because it does not consider it 'iBio's Technology' or 'Intellectual Property' a dispute may arise.",

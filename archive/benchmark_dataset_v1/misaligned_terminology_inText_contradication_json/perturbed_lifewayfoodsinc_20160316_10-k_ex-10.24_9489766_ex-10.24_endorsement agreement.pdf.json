Compensation\n(a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway may, at its sole discretion, provide remuneration (the \"Royalty\") equal to $0.02 for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics; provided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month. All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Lifeway 'agrees to pay' a royalty, making it an obligation. The modified text changes this to 'Lifeway may, at its sole discretion, provide remuneration', making the payment discretionary and using the term 'remuneration' which may or may not be equal to the explicitly defined royalty. Furthermore, the payment due date has been extended to 60 days introducing ambiguity to payment timelines.",

The modified version replaces these with 'postal mail or reputable courier', which broadens the acceptable methods but introduces ambiguity as 'reputable courier' is not defined. 'Notices' is changed to 'Official communications', 'change address' becomes 'update contact information,' and 'written notice' becomes 'reasonable notification,' without specifying what constitutes 'reasonable.' 'Approvals' is changed to 'consents' introducing a new term.",

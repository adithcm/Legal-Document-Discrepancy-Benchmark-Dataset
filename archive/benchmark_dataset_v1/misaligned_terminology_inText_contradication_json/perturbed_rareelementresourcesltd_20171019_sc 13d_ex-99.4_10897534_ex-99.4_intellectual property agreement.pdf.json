The modified text now allows Investor to disclose unpublished Technical Information to Third Parties without confidence, publicize the information via Investor channels and remove the condition that Investor must show that it developed or possessed the information prior to receiving it from the Company. This significantly changes the Investor's obligations and creates contradictions.",

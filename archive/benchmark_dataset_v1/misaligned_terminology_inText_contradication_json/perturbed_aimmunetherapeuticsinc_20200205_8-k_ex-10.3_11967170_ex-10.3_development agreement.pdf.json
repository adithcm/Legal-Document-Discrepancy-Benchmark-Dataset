                "explanation": "Here, the terms 'Aimmune Agreement Entities' and 'Selling Party' are altered to include 'distributors'. This contradicts the original definition that excludes them, creating uncertainty as to which entities are bound by the agreement and who the seller is. Therefore the parties could have conflicting understanding of which parties are ultimately bound by the agreement",

                "explanation": "The definitions of 'Regulatory Approval' and 'Regulatory Authority' are modified to remove any mention of pricing approvals. This creates a direct contradiction as it's unclear whether obtaining pricing approvals is necessary for commercializing a product, potentially causing disputes between the parties.",

                "explanation": "Here, the renaming of Xencor, Aimmune, and Joint Collaboration Patents to Xencor, Aimmune, and Joint Product Patents respectively introduces confusion. Since the original definitions are tied to the term 'Collaboration' versus 'Product' patents, using 'Product' when collaboration is required creates an ambiguity leading to enforcement challenges on the ownership of the patents.",

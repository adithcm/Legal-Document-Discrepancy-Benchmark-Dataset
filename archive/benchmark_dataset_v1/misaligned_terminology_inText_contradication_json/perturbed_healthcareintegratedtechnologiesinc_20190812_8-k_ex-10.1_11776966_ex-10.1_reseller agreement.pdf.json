                "explanation": "The definition of \"End User\" is changed to be much broader, removing the requirement to be related to a \"Customer\" or purchase anything. This creates a conflict, as the original definition limits the scope of end users, while the modified definition includes essentially anyone who uses the product.",

For such process, Supplier will allocate the additional cost on a pre-agreed per Product unit\nadditional price basis, which will be subject to an increase (subject to changes in taxes). Reseller agrees to reimburse\nSupplier for the reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by Supplier in connection with the shipment and\ndelivery of the Products, and of obtaining the foregoing registrations, licenses, permits, certificated and other\ndocumentation, provided that Supplier submits an invoice therefore in reasonable detail (and unless and solely to the\nextent such reimbursements is prohibited by Section 14.9 or prohibited under other applicable laws).

                "explanation": "The original text states that the supplier allocates costs on a per-unit price basis, implying the reseller ultimately pays. I changed it to mention that the distributor bears the costs directly. Then follows this with the original language stating that the reseller reimburses the supplier for related costs, introducing a contradiction. It is unclear who ultimately bears responsibility for the additional expenses and taxes.",

                "explanation": "The indemnification clause originally applies to interactions with Customers, End Users, or other third parties. By changing \"Customer and/or End User or other third party\" to just \"any individual\" without any further definition, the scope of indemnification becomes ambiguous, creating potential conflicts in enforcement. Now reseller is liable for interaction with anyone which isn't reasonable.",

                "changed_text": "1.2\n“CRO” means a clinical resource entity selected by ArTara to assist in the Project. University approval of the CRO is not required.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'CRO' is changed to 'clinical resource entity' and the requirement for University approval is removed, creating a contradiction with later sections that assume University approval is needed. This introduces uncertainty about the CRO's qualifications and oversight.",

During the term of the Project in accordance with the Project Plan, ArTara will provide thirty thousand dollars (US $30,000) per year in\nfunding for the Project, taking into consideration the time spent by University employees required for the Project.

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Funding' is altered to change the agreed payment from ArTara to a discretionary amount, effectively changing the funding obligation. This creates an in-text contradiction and can lead to disputes over funding.",

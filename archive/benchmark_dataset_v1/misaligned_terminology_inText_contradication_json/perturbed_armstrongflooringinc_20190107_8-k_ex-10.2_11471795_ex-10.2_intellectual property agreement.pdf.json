                "explanation": "Replacing \"Arizona Licensed IP\" with \"Arizona Licensed Assets\" introduces a contradiction, because \"Assets\" is not defined as a term and is not explicitly defined in Definitions and Interpretation Section 1.1 or 1.2. This ambiguity creates uncertainty about the scope of enforcement rights. The definition of Arizona Licensed IP includes Licensed Copyrights, Know-How, Patents and Trademarks but is not all encompassing, thus, the scope of what is in \"Assets\" is uncertain, which can create disputes.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'project sales lead finder' and 'sales representative' are used interchangeably without definition. 'Best efforts' is changed to 'reasonable efforts', creating ambiguity about the required level of diligence.",

                "explanation": "The term 'lead-finder fee' is replaced with 'commission', but the method and timing of payment are significantly altered. The original text defined a range (10-20%), making it a quantifiable range. The modified version removes the range and makes payment dependent on 'fund availability,' effectively nullifying the obligation of the party and removes the original condition of 'NET 30 days'.",

                "changed_text": "COMPANY shall reimburse Bravatek for direct losses suffered by Bravatek due to COMPANY's gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "The term 'indemnify' is replaced with 'reimburse for direct losses.' The original covers “any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs”. The modified section limits the compensation to 'direct losses' and only in the case of 'gross negligence,' a higher threshold than simple negligence or breach of contract, vastly reducing the scope of protection. This creates a direct contradiction in the scope of liability.",

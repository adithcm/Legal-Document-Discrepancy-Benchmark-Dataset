                "explanation": "Changing 'solely responsible' to 'primarily responsible' introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of ESSI's liability. Similarly, changing 'indemnify Talent' to 'fully indemnify Talent' suggests that ESSI might have some level of indemnification responsibility even in cases of Talent's negligence or misconduct, which is contradictory to the initial statement. The text now leads to uncertainy around the level and limit of liability.",

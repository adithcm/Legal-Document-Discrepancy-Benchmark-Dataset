                "explanation": "The term 'Investment Advisor' is changed to 'Advisor' in the second WHEREAS clause. Later in the document, both terms are used, creating ambiguity as to whether they refer to the same entity and introducing potential conflicts. This is because 'Investment Advisor' is a defined term, while 'Advisor' is not, thus generating confusion.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Investment Advisor' is replaced with 'Consultant'. This creates a conflict because the Investment Advisor is a defined term referring to Palmer Square BDC Advisor LLC, while Consultant is not defined. This raises questions about who is providing the investment services and whether the Licensee's obligations are affected by the introduction of an undefined party.",

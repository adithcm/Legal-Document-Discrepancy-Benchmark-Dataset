                "explanation": "By removing 'Limited' from Party A's name, we create ambiguity. Is 'Phoenix Satellite Television Company' the same legal entity as 'Phoenix Satellite Television Company Limited'? This could create disputes about which entity is bound by the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the words 'appropriate and necessary corporate action and other actions' and replacing it with 'all actions' this creates confusion. It is now ambiguous what actions are necessary to fulfill the requirements of the contract. Furthermore, by removing 'appropriate approvals and authorizations', and replacing it with 'all consents', this could lead to disputes as to whether the consents are sufficient to guarantee the terms.",

All of these changes alter the requirements in a material way and create uncertainty in enforcement. The key term is force majeure, and what is required to prove it and when and how.",

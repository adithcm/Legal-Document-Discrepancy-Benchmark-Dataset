                "explanation": "This Perturbation introduces “understandings” in place of “agreements” within the same clause and document. This can cause confusion, as 'agreements' typically carry a stronger legal weight than 'understandings,' especially given that this document is supposed to be an 'agreement'. The switch creates confusion about the enforceability of certain sections.",

                "explanation": "By altering 'Party' to 'Member' and 'Participant' and 'Claims' to 'Liabilities,' this edit adds an internal contradiction.  A 'claim' has a different legal standing than 'Liability'.

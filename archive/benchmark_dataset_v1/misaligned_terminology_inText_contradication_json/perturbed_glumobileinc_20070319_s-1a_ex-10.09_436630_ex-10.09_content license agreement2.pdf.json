                "original_text": "Consistent with Paragraph 15(c) of the Agreement, Licensee shall forfeit the Guarantee paid to date of ***** dollars",
                "changed_text": "Consistent with paragraph 15(c) of the Agreement, the Distributor may, at its discretion, relinquish any portion of the Guarantee previously remitted, up to a maximum value of ***** dollars",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Licensee 'shall forfeit' the guarantee, creating an obligation. The changed text uses 'Distributor' instead of Licensee and states that the Distributor 'may, at its discretion, relinquish any portion', making it optional and contradicting the initial obligatory statement.",

                "original_text": "Should Fox or its assigns choose to distribute the Wireless Products through Fox’s and its assigns’ direct-to-consumer distribution channels, Fox or its assigns shall deduct a percentage of Fox’s Gross Receipts (defined as monies received by or credited to Fox or its assigns from Fox’s or its assigns’ direct-to-consumer distribution channels, for the download of the Wireless Products by end users, or the sale or download of Wireless Products to end users) collected from the sale of such Wireless Products (“Distribution Fee”) in the amount of ***** percent (*****%) of Fox’s Gross Receipts. After Fox or its assigns deducts its Distribution Fee, it shall remit the remainder to Licensee and Licensee shall pay to Fox or its assigns or such other party as Fox or its assigns may designate in writing, Royalties in the amounts set forth in the Agreement or this Amendment.",
                "changed_text": "If the Licensor utilizes its direct-to-consumer distribution network for the Wireless Products, the Licensor may, as it deems appropriate, extract a service charge from the total revenue generated. This service charge, referred to as the “Marketing Cost,” will be determined by the Licensor based on market conditions. The remaining sum, after deducting the Marketing Cost, will be transferred to the Developer, who will then compensate the Licensor according to the Royalty stipulations detailed in the original contract.",
                "explanation": "This introduces several contradictions by using 'Licensor' for 'Fox,' 'Developer' for 'Licensee,' and 'Marketing Cost' for 'Distribution Fee.' The original text mandates a specific percentage deduction, while the modified text grants the Licensor discretion in determining the 'Marketing Cost' based on 'market conditions,' thus potentially conflicting with the originally agreed percentage.",

                "changed_text": "Excluding the Content Provider's stipulated financial responsibilities for all released Digital Media as of the Amendment date, and any supplemental duties outlined herein, all prior contractual commitments are voided, and any disputes emerging from this contract are indefinitely suspended.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces 'Content Provider' for 'Licensee', 'Digital Media' for 'Wireless Products'. The original text focuses on 'Royalties payment obligations', making it a clear financial responsibility whereas the modified one focuses on the 'stipulated financial responsibilities'. The change from 'mutually released' to 'indefinitely suspended' also introduces a contradiction concerning the finality of claims.",

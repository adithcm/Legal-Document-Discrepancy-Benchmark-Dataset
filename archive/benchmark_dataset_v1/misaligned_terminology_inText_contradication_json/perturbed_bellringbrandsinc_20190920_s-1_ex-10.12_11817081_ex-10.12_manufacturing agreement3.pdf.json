Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party,” sometimes referred to as a 'Supplier,' and collectively as the “Parties”.",
                "explanation": "The introduction of 'Supplier' as a possible alternative term for 'Party' without defining the precise circumstances in which they are interchangeable (or not) creates ambiguity. It's unclear if obligations assigned to a 'Party' also apply to a 'Supplier' if they are considered the same in certain contexts.",

[***], except that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, [***].",
                "explanation": "By adding 'Item' as another possible name for 'Unit', confusion is generated. If 'Item' is used later in the contract without explicit reference to 'Unit', it's ambiguous whether it refers to the same thing and if the specifications for 'Units' also apply to 'Items'.",

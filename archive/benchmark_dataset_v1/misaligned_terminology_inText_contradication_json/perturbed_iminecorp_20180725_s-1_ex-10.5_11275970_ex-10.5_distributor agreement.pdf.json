                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' is replaced with 'Vendor'. This creates a contradiction, as later sections refer to the original term Distributor, and it's not consistently changed, making it unclear if Distributor and Vendor are the same.",

While they might seem interchangeable, legal interpretations could differ, especially if 'goods' has a specific definition elsewhere or under applicable law, while other sections keep using the term Products. This creates uncertainty about the scope of the agreement.",

It's now unclear if 'Distributor' and 'Reseller' refer to the same entity, especially considering the warranty terms. The document does not state they're interchangeable, creating uncertainty about who the warranty applies to and whether the Distributor is also considered the Reseller for warranty purposes.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Unit Franchises' to 'Company Owned Stores' and 'Unit Franchisees' to 'Store Operators' introduces a contradiction regarding the franchise model. The agreement initially grants rights related to Unit Franchises, but later refers to Company Owned Stores, which implies a different operational structure. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as the obligations and rights associated with each model differ significantly.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'required' to 'appropriate' and 'notice' to 'notification' introduces ambiguity. 'Required' implies a defined standard set by the franchisor, whereas 'appropriate' is subjective. Similarly, 'notice' has legal weight, while 'notification' is less formal. This makes enforcement uncertain, as the franchisee could argue about what is deemed 'appropriate' or if a less formal notification was sufficient.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'ability' to 'aptitude', 'potential sales' to 'anticipated sales' and 'Franchised Business' to 'Outlets' introduces inconsistencies. 'Ability' suggests demonstrated skill, while 'aptitude' implies inherent talent. 'Potential' suggests a range of possibilities, whereas 'anticipated' sales implies a prediction, blurring the lines of risk. Further, the switch to “Outlets” as opposed to “Franchised Businesses” raises questions about the scope of the disclaimer, and whether it fully applies to franchisees.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Sponsorship Benefits' clearly states that it includes a fee. The modified definition uses the term 'considerations' and 'any potential payments' which implies that the fee is not guaranteed. This contradicts the initial agreement that includes the 'Sponsorship Fee' as a fixed commitment from Newegg to Allied.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that 'Sponsorship Rights' includes a bundle of rights, services and deliverables which Allied WILL provide, but the modified version uses terms 'collection of opportunities', 'possible deliverables' and 'may include', making the provision of Sponsorship Rights uncertain and discretionary. This contradicts Allied's defined obligations.",

Allied may refund a portion of previously paid Sponsorship Fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces that Newegg will be 'immediately discharged of all obligations to pay any further Sponsorship Fees', but the modified version changed this term into 'reduced commitments to pay', meaning the obligations are still present, but there are just less. Furthermore, the original stated 'the Sponsorship Fee shall be prorated...and Allied shall refund', which places a legal obligation on Allied to make the refund, but the modified text changes this language into 'Allied may refund', which removed the explicit legal requirement.",

                "original_text": "A. “Contract Period” shall mean that period of time of three (3) years commencing on November 1st, 2017 and concluding November 2nd, 2020, unless terminated sooner or extended as provided in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "A. “Contract Period” shall mean that period of time of three (3) years commencing on November 1st, 2017 and concluding November 2nd, 2020. Alternatively, the \"Agreement Term\" refers to a potentially shorter or longer duration, subject to the renewal clause outlined in Section Fifteen.",
                "explanation": "The introduction of “Agreement Term” as an alternative to “Contract Period”, while not explicitly defined, introduces ambiguity. This conflicts with the original definition of the “Contract Period” as a fixed three-year term, as it suggests the period may be subject to change or interpretation, causing confusion about the actual duration of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"license fee\" to \"service fee\" without a corresponding definition creates ambiguity. It is unclear if these terms are interchangeable or if they have different implications regarding the nature of the payment and any associated rights or obligations. This can create confusion and potentially impact the enforceability of the payment obligation.",

                "original_text": "1.11 “Delivery” shall mean the time when the Product is placed at the disposal of Kitov at Dexcel’s Facility based on an **** (Incoterms® 2010).",

                "explanation": "The introduction of 'Delivery Point' as a synonym for 'Delivery' creates confusion. The original definition of Delivery aligns with the standard Incoterms, implying a specific transfer of responsibility. The added definition introduces uncertainty about the exact location and responsibilities, potentially leading to disputes over loss or damage of the product during transport.",

Dexcel shall provide any and all reasonable assistance to Kitov in this respect during the Term.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'suppliers' with 'vendors' within the same clause, it introduces ambiguity. While often used interchangeably, in a manufacturing context, 'suppliers' usually refers to those providing raw materials, while 'vendors' can be a broader term including service providers. This could create confusion on who bears the cost when dealing with different types of providers.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'Delivery' to 'Shipment' in section 4.6, the contract introduces conflicting responsibilities. 'Delivery' implies transfer of ownership and risk, while 'Shipment' only refers to the act of dispatching goods. This is problematic because it's now unclear at which point Dexcel's financial responsibility ends for recalls related to non-conforming products, leading to potential disputes.",

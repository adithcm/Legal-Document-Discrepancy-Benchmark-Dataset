                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the “Exchange Act”) the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with what is commonly understood as securities exchange practices, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint submission of Clarus IV-A, L.P., Clarus IV-B, L.P., Clarus IV-C, L.P., Clarus IV-D, L.P., Clarus IV GP, L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.P., Blackstone Clarus GP L.L.C., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings I/II GP L.L.C., The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and Stephen A. Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing deemed appropriate by such party under Section 13 or any similar guidelines (including any alterations, updates, additions, and/or attachment thereto) regarding investments of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and additionally consent to the submission, provision, and/or integration via reference of this Agreement as an accompanying document.",
                "explanation": "Replaced the clearly defined \"Securities Exchange Act of 1934\" with the vague term \"what is commonly understood as securities exchange practices.\" Also the phrase \"rule or regulation thereunder\" has been changed to \"any similar guidelines\". Furthermore, the phrase \"exhibit\" was swapped with \"accompanying document\". This creates ambiguity about which specific laws and regulations the parties are bound by, undermining the enforceability of the agreement under securities law.",

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each party is responsible for ensuring filings are made when convenient and that provided details related to them seem generally correct. No party is accountable for how accurate or complete the data from other involved parties may be, unless they know or suspect such details might be wrong.",
                "explanation": "The term \"timely filing\" has a specific meaning under securities law, implying adherence to strict deadlines. Replacing it with \"filings are made when convenient\" introduces a contradiction. Similarly, \"completeness and accuracy\" is watered down to \"seem generally correct,\" weakening the obligation to provide truthful information as required by SEC regulations. The standards of accuracy are subjective, creating a contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement is to be fully active and effective until any involved party decides to withdraw, doing so by telling the others, ideally in writing, at which point the agreement no longer applies to them alone.",
                "explanation": "The phrase \"revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing\" provides a clear and legally sound process for termination of the agreement. The phrase \"decides to withdraw, doing so by telling the others, ideally in writing\" is much more ambiguous and contradicts the original explicit requirements.",

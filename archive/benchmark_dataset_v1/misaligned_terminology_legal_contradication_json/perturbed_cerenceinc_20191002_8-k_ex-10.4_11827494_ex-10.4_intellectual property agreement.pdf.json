                "changed_text": "“Data” means select pieces of information, databases and collections and compilations of information, in a specific format.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Data\" is broad, encompassing all forms and mediums. The modified definition restricts it to 'select pieces of information' in 'specific format,' creating a contradiction. This narrower definition could exclude certain types of data from the agreement's scope, leading to disputes over intellectual property rights.",

                "original_text": "“Trade Secrets” means all information, in any form or medium, to the extent that the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret and the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public.",
                "changed_text": "“Trade Secrets” means only documented information, in a written form, for which the owner has filed formal legal protection, deriving economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly narrows the definition of \"Trade Secrets.\" The original definition includes 'all information, in any form or medium,' while the modified definition restricts it to 'documented information, in a written form, for which the owner has filed formal legal protection'. This contradicts standard legal definitions of trade secrets, which do not require formal filing or documentation, only reasonable measures to maintain secrecy. The modified version will make it harder to claim trade secret protection. By raising that burden of what is claimed as a trade secret, it introduces a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "“Intellectual Property Rights” or “IPR” means any and all intellectual property rights existing anywhere in the world associated with any and all (i)\nPatents, (ii) Trademarks, (iii) Copyrights, (iv) Domain Names, (v) rights in Technology, (vi) rights in Trade Secrets, (vii) rights in Data, (viii) all tangible\nembodiments of the foregoing in whatever form or medium and (ix) any other legal protections and rights related to any of the foregoing. “Intellectual\nProperty Rights” specifically excludes contractual rights (including license grants from third parties).",
                "changed_text": "“Intellectual Property Rights” or “IPR” means some of the intellectual property rights existing within the United States associated with (i) Patents, (ii) Trademarks, (iii) Copyrights. \"Intellectual Property Rights\" includes contractual rights (including license grants from third parties).",
                "explanation": "The original text broadly defines IPR, but the modification limits it to within the United States and also only to a limited number of (i), (ii), and (iii). This also contradicts the last sentence of the original, where it specifically excludes contractual rights, but the changed text states that it includes contractual rights.",

                "explanation": "Changing “all rights” to “some rights” regarding the Brand creates ambiguity about the extent of the licensor's ownership. Trademark law requires clear ownership for licensing. The modified text introduces uncertainty and could render the license unenforceable or give rise to disputes over the scope of rights granted, conflicting with established trademark law principles about ownership and control.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"written notice\" to \"verbal notice\" contradicts standard contract law requirements for providing clear and documented termination notice. Contract law typically requires termination notices to be in writing to provide a clear record and avoid disputes. This change creates uncertainty about how termination is to be communicated and proven, potentially leading to legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "Changing “exclusive jurisdiction” to “non-exclusive jurisdiction” alters the legal venue for resolving disputes. 'Exclusive jurisdiction' means only New York courts can hear disputes, while 'non-exclusive' means other courts could also be appropriate. This creates uncertainty in where legal proceedings may occur, potentially conflicting with established jurisdictional clauses and increasing litigation costs if the parties disagree on the appropriate venue.",

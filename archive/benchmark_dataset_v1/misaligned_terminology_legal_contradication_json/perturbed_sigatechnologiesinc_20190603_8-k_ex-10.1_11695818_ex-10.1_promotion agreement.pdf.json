With respect to the Promotion or other exploitation of the Product,\n“Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means actions deemed necessary solely at MMT’s discretion, irrespective of industry standards or profitability.",
                "explanation": "The modification redefines 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' to allow MMT's discretion to override standards, conflicting with the standard legal interpretation that balances diligence with reasonableness.

'Discretionary amount' does not provide a defined metric for determining fees, making the compensation terms too vague to be enforceable.

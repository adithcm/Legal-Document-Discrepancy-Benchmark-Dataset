                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Licensee will have full authority, power and control over the operation of the Station, including the HD2 Channel, and over all persons working at the Station’s facilities during the Term. Licensee will bear the responsibility for the Station’s compliance with all applicable provisions of the rules and policies of the FCC.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee will have general oversight of the Station's operation, including the HD2 Channel, but Programmer will manage day-to-day activities. Programmer will bear the responsibility for the Station’s compliance with most, but not all, provisions of the rules and policies of the FCC.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and contradicts FCC regulations, which require the Licensee to maintain ultimate control and responsibility for the station's operation and compliance. The original text clearly states the Licensee's full authority and responsibility, as required by the FCC. The modified text shifts some responsibility to the Programmer, creating uncertainty and potentially violating FCC regulations regarding licensee control.",

                "changed_text": "Programmer agrees that the contents of the WLIB Programs it transmits to Licensee should generally conform to FCC guidelines, but minor deviations may occur. Programmer may occasionally provide other programming, subject to Licensee approval, for broadcast on the HD2 Channel.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the requirement for strict adherence to FCC rules and introduces the possibility of non-compliant content and programming on the channel. This contradicts the licensee's responsibility to ensure all broadcast content adheres to FCC regulations.",

During the Term, Programmer shall cooperate with Licensee as Licensee complies with its political broadcast responsibilities, and shall supply such information promptly to Licensee as may be necessary to comply with the political advertising time record keeping, reasonable access, and lowest unit charge requirements of federal law.",

During the Term, Programmer shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Licensee as Licensee attempts to comply with its political broadcast responsibilities, and shall supply information to the best of its ability.

                "explanation": "This change lessens the Licensee's legal obligations to comply with political broadcast rules and transfers some responsibility to the Programmer. This contradicts the FCC's regulations and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, which place the ultimate responsibility for political broadcasting compliance on the licensee.",

For purposes\nof this definition, “controlling” (including, “controlled by” and “under\ncommon control”) shall mean: (a) ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity capital or other ownership interest in or of an entity; (b) the\npower to control or otherwise direct the affairs of an entity; (c) in the case of non-stock organizations, the power to control the distribution of\nprofits of an entity; or (d) such other relationship as, in fact, results in actual control over the management, business, and affairs of an entity;",
                "changed_text": "In this Agreement, in addition to words and phrases defined where they are used, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings:\na) “Affiliate” of a Party shall mean any entity, directly or indirectly, associated with a Party. For purposes of this definition, “associated with”\nshall mean: (a) ownership of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the equity capital or other ownership interest in or of an entity; (b) influence\nover the affairs of an entity; (c) the ability to request the distribution of profits of an entity; or (d) such other nominal relationship as, in fact, suggests\ncooperation over the management, business, and affairs of an entity;",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' aligns with standard corporate law definitions of control, generally requiring at least 50% ownership. The modified definition changes 'controlling' to 'associated with' and lowers the ownership percentage to 25% and replaces 'the power to control' with the more ambiguous term 'influence.' This creates uncertainty in determining which entities qualify as affiliates, which is crucial for various contractual obligations and liabilities.",

                "explanation": "The original definition provided specific exclusions and a detailed list of what constitutes Confidential Information. The modified version removes the specific requirement that the information be 'written' and 'identified as Confidential,' making it less clear what is protected. Omitting 'Affiliates' from the exemptions significantly narrows the scope of protection. The term 'general knowledge' is vague, offering a wider exclusion than 'public domain.' Furthermore, the removal of 'competent written records' creates ambiguity about independent development of information.",

                "changed_text": "“Affiliate” means an entity, directly or indirectly, managed by a party without regard to control, either now or in the future, and their respective successors and assigns.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliate\" aligns with the standard legal definition requiring control. By replacing 'controlled' with 'managed,' the definition now includes entities that a party merely manages, even without ownership or control. This contradicts established legal principles that require a control relationship for affiliate status, creating uncertainty about which entities are bound by the agreement as affiliates.",

                "changed_text": "“Net Revenue(s)” shall be defined as fifty percent (50%) of gross revenues and all other receivables of any kind whatsoever received by Zynga or any of Zynga’s affiliates attributable to the use of Paid Currency or in connection with the sale of Virtual Digital Goods derived from use of the WPT-brand on the Zynga platform, less the following 'Potential Deductions': (i) reasonable payment processing fees, commissions, and platform distribution fees at Zynga's discretion; (ii) any governmental taxes at Zynga's discretion; and (iii) charge-backs/refunds/cancellations/fraud.",
                "explanation": "By changing the revenue percentage from 100% to 50%, the contract directly contradicts the original agreement on revenue sharing. Additionally, replacing \"Allowable Deductions\" with \"Potential Deductions\" and removing the \"actual and verifiable\" requirement introduces ambiguity, allowing Zynga to deduct expenses at their discretion. This undermines the precise financial terms initially agreed upon and creates a legal contradiction regarding revenue calculation and distribution.",

                "explanation": "The original clause defines \"Force Majeure\" events as external, uncontrollable events, which is a standard legal definition. The modified clause replaces these with \"business downturn\" or \"market fluctuation\", which are typical business risks and not legally recognized as force majeure. This drastically expands the conditions under which the contract can be terminated, contradicting the intent of a force majeure clause to cover unforeseeable and unavoidable events and rendering the clause open to abuse.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"trade secrets\" from the definition of Confidential Information and stating the contract shall not be considered confidential information contradicts established legal precedents and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA). Trade secrets are legally protected; their explicit exclusion creates enforceability issues.",

Such payments shall be accompanied\nby a statement containing reasonable detail of the number of VerticalNet-Leaders\nOnline Clients generated during the month, the type and number of transactions\nfrom which the LeadersOnline VerticalNet Revenue was derived, the total\nLeadersOnline VerticalNet Revenue for such period and the total fees payable to\nVerticalNet pursuant to this Section 6.3.1  [Revenue Sharing].",

Such payments may or may not be accompanied\nby a statement containing detail. This section is merely a suggestion and not a requirement. This is at the discretion of LeadersOnline.",
                "explanation": "By changing the payment terms to be discretionary and not required introduces a legal contradiction. Contract law requires consideration (payment) for an agreement to be binding. Making the payments voluntary undermines the entire revenue-sharing clause, creating a legally unenforceable promise.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces contradictory elements to the 'independent contractor' clause. By stating that VerticalNet can dictate the working hours, methods, and means of LeadersOnline, the text undermines the definition of an independent contractor, which requires autonomy and control over one's work. This alteration raises potential legal conflicts under labor laws, misclassifying LeadersOnline as an employee under a contract. These changes may violate the laws on employee classification",

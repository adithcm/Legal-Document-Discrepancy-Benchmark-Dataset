                "original_text": "“Firm Service” shall mean service for which Transporter is contractually entitled to interrupt its performance only to the extent (i) that such performance is excused pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement relating to Force Majeure, (ii) of specified periods of maintenance, or (iii) that Transporter determines that the operation of all or any portion of its facilities will cause injury or harm to persons or property or to the integrity of its facilities, and with respect to each of (i), (ii) or (iii), only to the extent that Transporter has curtailed all service of the same priority on a pro rata basis in accordance with Article V.",
                "changed_text": "“Firm Service” shall mean service for which Transporter is contractually entitled to interrupt its performance to any extent deemed necessary for operational efficiency, including but not limited to (i) events considered Force Majeure, (ii) any maintenance deemed necessary, or (iii) any perceived risk to persons, property, or facility integrity, without any obligation to curtail other services pro rata.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Firm Service' includes specific, limited conditions under which service can be interrupted, and requires pro rata curtailment of other services of the same priority. The modified definition broadens the conditions for interruption to include vaguely defined 'operational efficiency' and 'any perceived risk,' and removes the pro rata curtailment requirement. This contradicts the standard understanding of 'Firm Service' in the natural gas industry, which implies a higher degree of reliability and predictability. This change introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce the original intent of providing reliable gas transportation service.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under contract law; potential violation of state-specific regulations regarding natural gas transportation.",

                "original_text": "“Gas” shall mean any mixture of gaseous hydrocarbons, consisting essentially of methane and heavier hydrocarbons and inert and noncombustible gases that are extracted from the subsurface of the earth.",
                "changed_text": "“Gas” shall mean any substance, regardless of its composition or origin, that Transporter accepts into the Transportation System.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Gas' is specific to gaseous hydrocarbons extracted from the earth. The modified definition broadens it to 'any substance,' regardless of composition or origin, as long as the Transporter accepts it. This contradicts the typical understanding and regulation of natural gas, which is based on its chemical composition and origin. This change introduces uncertainty as to what substances the Transporter is obligated to transport, potentially including substances that could damage the system or violate environmental regulations. It is misaligned with the statutory definition of natural gas used in various state and federal regulations, potentially affecting compliance and liability.",

                "changed_text": "“Measurement Facility” shall mean any device used by Transporter to estimate the quantity of gas flowing through the Transportation System, without regard to accuracy or industry standards. “Measurement Facilities” shall mean, in Transporter’s sole determination, those locations deemed necessary for such estimation.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Measurement Facility' refers to specific equipment providing custody transfer volumes, implying accurate and standardized measurement. The modified definition broadens it to 'any device' used to 'estimate' gas quantity, without regard to accuracy or industry standards, and grants Transporter sole discretion in determining facility locations. This contradicts standard practices and regulations for gas measurement, which require calibrated meters and adherence to industry standards for accurate volume determination. This change introduces significant uncertainty and potential for disputes over gas volumes and associated fees, violating principles of fair dealing and potentially running afoul of regulatory requirements for accurate measurement.",
                "contradicted_law": "State regulations concerning accurate measurement of natural gas for custody transfer; potential violation of FERC regulations related to fair and transparent practices.",

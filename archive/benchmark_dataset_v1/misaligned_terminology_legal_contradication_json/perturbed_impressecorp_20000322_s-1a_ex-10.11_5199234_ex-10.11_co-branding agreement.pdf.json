                "original_text": "1.5. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall mean, subject to the provisions of\nSection 7.2  [EXCLUSIONS], all proprietary and confidential information of a party, including,\nwithout limitation, trade secrets, technical information, business information,\nsales information, customer and potential customer lists and identities, product\nsales plans, sublicense agreements, inventions, developments, discoveries,\nsoftware, know-how, methods, techniques, formulae, data, processes and other\ntrade secrets and proprietary ideas, whether or not protectable under patent,\ntrademark, copyright or other areas of law, that the other party has access to\nor receives. For purposes of this Agreement,",

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall mean, subject to the provisions of\nSection 7.2  [EXCLUSIONS], all non-public information, regardless of its nature,\nincluding, but not limited to, publicly available information, business data,\nmarketing strategies, general customer lists, product plans, agreements,\ndevelopments, generic software, common knowledge, standard methods, widely known\ntechniques, basic formulas, universal processes and other ideas, regardless of legal protection,\nthat the other party has access to\nor receives. For purposes of this Agreement,",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION' has been broadened to include publicly available information and other types of information that are generally not considered confidential under trade secret and intellectual property laws. This creates a contradiction by attempting to classify common or public knowledge as confidential, which is legally dubious and unenforceable. This contradicts Delaware trade secret law, which typically requires information to be secret and not readily ascertainable.",

This Agreement does not, and shall not be\nconstrued to, create an employer-employee, agency, joint venture or partnership\nrelationship between the parties. Neither party shall have any authority to act\nfor or to bind the other party in any way, to alter any of the terms or\nconditions of any of the other party's standard forms of invoices, sales\nagreements, warranties or otherwise, or to warrant or to execute agreements on\nbehalf of the other or to represent that it is in any way responsible for the\nacts, debts, liabilities or omissions of the other party.",

This Agreement shall be construed to, create an agency relationship between the parties. Each party shall have the authority to act\nfor and to bind the other party in specific cases, to alter any of the terms or\nconditions of any of the other party's standard forms of invoices, sales\nagreements, warranties or otherwise, or to warrant or to execute agreements on\nbehalf of the other or to represent that it is in any way responsible for the\nacts, debts, liabilities or omissions of the other party.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the definition of 'independent contractor' by granting each party the authority to act for and bind the other, which is a characteristic of an agency relationship. This misclassification can lead to legal disputes regarding liability, taxation, and compliance with labor laws. The change introduces uncertainty regarding the true nature of the relationship and could make the 'independent contractor' clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By stating that the agreement is governed by 'principles of fairness and mutual understanding' perceived 'subjectively by each party' and explicitly excluding reference to any legal jurisdiction, the modified clause directly contradicts the standard legal definition of 'governing law'. Governing law provides a clear, objective framework for interpreting and enforcing the contract. This change introduces ambiguity and makes the contract unenforceable, as it replaces objective legal standards with subjective interpretations, which is not recognized by courts. This change attempts to contract outside the domain of legality.",

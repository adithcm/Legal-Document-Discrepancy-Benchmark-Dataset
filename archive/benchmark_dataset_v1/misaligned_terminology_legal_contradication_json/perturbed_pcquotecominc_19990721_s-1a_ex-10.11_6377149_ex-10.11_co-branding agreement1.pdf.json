The original contract specifies it to be a 'software application'.

                "explanation": "The term 'proprietary digital data feed transmitted via satellite, land line, or Internet with advanced compression technology, containing financial market information obtained by PCQ from the institutions and exchanges listed in Section 5 of this Agreement.' was replaced with 'data stream transmitted via methods including satellite, land line, or Internet, containing market information. This data includes stock data, commodities, and related data.' This creates legal uncertainty. The specific and limiting language of 'proprietary digital data feed' has implications for data security and intellectual property law, whereas the vague term 'data stream' and 'stock data' could be interpreted as not providing the same level of security, which could potentially run afoul of financial regulations.",

Under US law, 'finance charge' and 'annual percentage rate' are legally defined terms with specific disclosure requirements (Truth in Lending Act). Using 'late fee' and omitting 'annual' circumvents these requirements, potentially misleading the other party and creating a legal contradiction.",

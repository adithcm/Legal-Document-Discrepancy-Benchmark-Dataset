                "original_text": "(i) \"Net Revenues\" means all monetary consideration theglobe actually\nreceives for CPM- or CPC-based advertisements and promotions (other than those\nfor its commerce partners) delivered in connection with the Co-Branded Pages,\nless a sales and administration fee of 15%.",
                "changed_text": "(i) \"Net Revenues\" means all monetary consideration theglobe potentially\nreceives for CPM- or CPC-based advertisements and promotions, including from its commerce partners, delivered in connection with the Co-Branded Pages,\nless a discretionary deduction for overhead.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Net Revenues' is changed to be ambiguous and at the globe's discretion. Specifically, the word 'actually' is changed to 'potentially', which broadens the scope to include revenues not yet received. Removing the exclusion for commerce partners and replacing the fixed fee with a discretionary deduction creates financial uncertainty.",

Neither party shall make any warranties or representations on behalf of the other party.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict by stating the parties are independent contractors while allowing for behaviors that could be interpreted as creating an employer-employee relationship. This undermines the 'independent contractor' status, leading to potential legal issues with employment classifications.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'unless otherwise noted' and 'except those required by state consumer protection statutes,' the warranty disclaimer is weakened. This introduces ambiguity as the 'otherwise noted' warranties are not specified, and the reference to consumer protection statutes can override the 'AS IS' provision. It creates uncertainty over which warranties apply, potentially violating state laws if the agreement fails to uphold required consumer protections.",

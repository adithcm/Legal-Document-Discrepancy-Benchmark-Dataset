                "changed_text": "1.11 “Delivery” shall mean the time when the Product is considered transferred to Kitov, regardless of its location or Incoterms. The exact location will be at the discretion of Dexcel.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Delivery' is tied to Incoterms® 2010, a standardized set of international trade terms. The modified definition removes this reference and makes the location of delivery discretionary, contradicting established legal and commercial practices. This creates uncertainty regarding the point at which risk and responsibility transfer to Kitov.",

                "changed_text": "1.35 “Specifications” shall mean the general description of the product, as determined solely by Dexcel, and may be changed at any time without prior notice or requirement to meet health authority standards.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties product specifications to the Marketing Authorization and Health Authority requirements, which are legally binding. The modified definition gives Dexcel unilateral control over the specifications and removes the requirement to meet health authority standards. This contradicts regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing and could lead to non-compliance and potential legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "The original clause guarantees the product's compliance with the Product Specifications, Marketing Authorization, cGMP, and Quality Agreement.

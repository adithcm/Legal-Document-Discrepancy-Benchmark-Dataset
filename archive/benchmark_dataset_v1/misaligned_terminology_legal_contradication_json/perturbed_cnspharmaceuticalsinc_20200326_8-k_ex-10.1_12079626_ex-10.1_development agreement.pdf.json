                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' included proprietary technical, business, and financial information regardless of whether it was explicitly marked as 'confidential'. The modified definition changes this, stating that such information is only confidential if explicitly marked as such. This contradicts standard legal interpretations of confidentiality, which often protect trade secrets and sensitive business information even if not explicitly labeled.",

The duty to avoid a violation will not extend to unintentional acts.",
                "explanation": "The original clause required WPD to ensure no violation of the FCPA. The modified version adds a condition that a violation only occurs if WPD management has documented evidence of the action beforehand and that the clause does not extend to unintentional acts. This significantly narrows the scope of compliance with the FCPA, contradicting the intent and strict liability aspects of the law. The FCPA prohibits corrupt payments, regardless of intent, if those payments are made to influence a foreign official.",

                "explanation": "The original definition mandated that the Development Fee be 50% of Net Sales. The added clause allows WPD to unilaterally lower the fee based on 'market conditions'.

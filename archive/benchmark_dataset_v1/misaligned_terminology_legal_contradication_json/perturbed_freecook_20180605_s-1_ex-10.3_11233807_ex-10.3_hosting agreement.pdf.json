                "original_text": "Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
                "changed_text": "Additional Work shall be loosely interpreted as any change, addition, or revision of pages, graphics, or other features. Company has sole discretion to determine if work qualifies as additional.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Additional Work' was relatively specific, outlining criteria for what constitutes extra billable tasks. The modified version makes the definition vague and gives the Company broad, undefined discretion to classify work as 'additional.' This conflicts with standard contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms, making enforcement unpredictable. It allows for arbitrary charges, potentially violating good faith and fair dealing principles.",

It is Client’s sole responsibility to check the accuracy of the written content and correct any errors prior to submission for final publication. Company will assume that all the written content submitted by Client has been proofread and is ready for publication.",
                "changed_text": "Company may, but is not required to, proofread or correct any contextual, grammatical or typographical errors. The responsibility of accuracy is shared between the Client and Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text placed the sole responsibility for proofreading and accuracy on the Client. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the company 'may, but is not required to' proofread. This shared responsibility contradicts the initial clear allocation of duty, potentially leading to disputes over errors and liability. It implies a duty of care that could be interpreted under negligence principles, despite the original contract aiming to disclaim such responsibility.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines 'normal business hours' with specificity. The modified text replaces this with a vague reference to 'generally available' and allows the company to unilaterally change these hours without notice. This introduces uncertainty and potentially violates the principle of 'reasonable expectations' in contract law. A client relying on the original business hours might suffer damages if the company changes them unexpectedly, leading to breach of contract claims.",

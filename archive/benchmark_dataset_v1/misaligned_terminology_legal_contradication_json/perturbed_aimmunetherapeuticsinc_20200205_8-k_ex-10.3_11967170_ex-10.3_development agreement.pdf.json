Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",

                "explanation": "The change in the definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' introduces uncertainty. The original definition includes objective criteria, the modified version makes the obligation vague. This introduces misaligned terminology, as commercially reasonable efforts are no longer defined in a legally binding way, but instead 'any effort the company wants'.",

                "explanation": "Changing the definition of “Generic Product” introduces misaligned terminology, as the need for a similarity to the Product is based on Aimmune’s discretion. Legally, a generic product must meet specific standards of bioequivalence and similarity to the original, which this change removes and contradicts. This means that they can decide on their own discretion.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Invented' relies on established legal standards (US patent law - Title 35). The modified version gives Xencor the right to determine 'inventorship' based on just 'thinking about' the invention. This conflicts with the statutory definition of inventorship, which requires conception and reduction to practice. The change introduces legal uncertainty as it deviates from the established legal standards for determining inventorship, giving Xencor too much discretion.",

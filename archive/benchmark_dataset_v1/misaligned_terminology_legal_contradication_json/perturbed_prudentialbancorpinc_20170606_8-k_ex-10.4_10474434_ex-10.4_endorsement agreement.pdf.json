                "original_text": "\"Base Salary\" means the Employee's total base salary as of each January 1st exclusive of special payments such as bonuses or\ncommissions, but including any salary reductions made in accordance with Section 125 or 401(k) of the Code.",
                "changed_text": "\"Base Salary\" means the Employee's total remuneration, including bonuses, commissions, and any other form of compensation, before any deductions, as determined annually.",
                "explanation": "This modification broadens the definition of \"Base Salary\" to include bonuses and commissions, directly contradicting the original definition, which explicitly excluded them. This could lead to disputes over the calculation of benefits or payouts tied to base salary, creating legal uncertainty. The original definition clearly excludes bonuses and commissions aligning with standard compensation practices for base salary calculations.",

The\nEmployer will have and may exercise, except as limited hereinafter, all ownership rights in the Policies. The Employer will not take any action in\ndealing with the Insurer that would impair any right or interest of the Employee in the Policies.",
                "changed_text": "The Employer retains the right to alter beneficiary designations unilaterally. The Employer reserves all ownership rights, and is not obligated to protect the Employee's interests in the Policies.",
                "explanation": "This alteration removes the protection for the employee's interests and gives the employer unilateral control over beneficiary designations, conflicting with the original intent of the split-dollar agreement to provide a benefit to the employee. This undermines the employee's rights and introduces a legal contradiction regarding the agreement's purpose.",

                "explanation": "This modification negates the \"entire agreement\" clause and allows for oral modifications, creating uncertainty about the contract's terms. Furthermore, the governing law clause now permits the Employer to choose the governing jurisdiction, which could disadvantage the Employee.

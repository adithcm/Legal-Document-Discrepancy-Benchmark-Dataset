                "changed_text": "Celebrity represents and warrants that during the Term and in the Territory, Celebrity will not endorse or make any appearances or advertisements on behalf of any similar health product.",
                "explanation": "The original text restricts endorsements for 'any other multivitamin.' The modified text broadens the restriction to 'any similar health product.' This introduces ambiguity because 'similar health product' is not a legally defined term, unlike 'multivitamin,' which has established standards. This change creates uncertainty regarding what products fall under the endorsement restriction, making enforcement more difficult.",

                "changed_text": "HDS’ products will generally conform to most federal, state and local guidelines related to product marketing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause guarantees full compliance with 'all applicable federal, state and local laws'. The modified version weakens this to 'generally conform to most guidelines related to product marketing'. This creates a legal contradiction because it implies that HDS's products may not fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, especially those related to product safety and consumer protection, and 'most guidelines' is ambigious.",

                "changed_text": "Time is generally a factor for consideration in the performance of the duties and obligations hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that 'time is of the essence,' a legal term meaning strict adherence to deadlines is required. The modified text changes this to 'time is generally a factor for consideration.' This weakens the importance of deadlines and introduces ambiguity. This contradicts the legal principle of 'time is of the essence,' making it harder to enforce strict deadlines and claim breach of contract for delays.",

                "original_text": "“Confidential Information” means any information of a Party, its Affiliates, members, licensors, consultants, service providers, advisors or agents that is confidential or proprietary, however recorded or preserved, whether written or oral. Confidential Information includes trade secrets, pricing data, employee information, customer information, cost information, supplier information, financial and tax matters, third-party contract terms, inventions, know-how, processes, methods, models, technical information, schedules, code, ideas, concepts, data, software and business plans (regardless of whether such information is identified as confidential).",
                "changed_text": "“Confidential Information” means any information of a Party, its Affiliates, members, licensors, consultants, service providers, advisors or agents that is considered valuable, whether written or oral. Confidential Information includes pricing data, employee information, customer information, supplier information, financial and tax matters, third-party contract terms, inventions, know-how, processes, methods, models, technical information, schedules, code, ideas, concepts, data, software and business plans.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'trade secrets' and replacing 'confidential or proprietary' with 'valuable', the definition becomes ambiguous. Trade secrets have a specific legal meaning; 'valuable' does not. This change creates uncertainty and potential unenforceability regarding what information is actually protected under the agreement, conflicting with established trade secret law.",

                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with standard legal definitions. The modified definition is overly narrow and contradicts the standard understanding of 'law,' which includes statutes, orders, regulations, and judicial decisions. This could lead to disputes over which legal requirements the parties are bound by.",

The modifications create a conflict and ambiguity, as some implied warranties, like merchantability, are inherent and not tied to a specific timeframe.

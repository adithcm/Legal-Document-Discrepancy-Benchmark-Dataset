                "original_text": "We grant to you, upon the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the exclusive right to establish and operate a Franchised Business and a license to use the methods, procedures and products developed by us in the business of selling and servicing Unit Franchises in the territory described on Attachment A attached to this Agreement and incorporated into this Agreement by reference (the “Master Territory”). You shall operate the Franchised Business at or from a location of your choice within the Master Territory upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "We grant to you, upon the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the exclusive right to establish and operate a Franchised Business and a license to use the methods, procedures and products developed by us in the business of selling and servicing Unit Franchises in the territory described on Attachment A attached to this Agreement and incorporated into this Agreement by reference (the “Master Territory”). You shall operate the Franchised Business at or from any location as you see fit, both within and outside the Master Territory, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification allows the franchisee to operate outside the defined \"Master Territory,\" conflicting with the initial grant of \"exclusive right\" within that territory. This creates uncertainty about territorial rights, violating the intended exclusivity.",

You shall adhere to all current established policies, practices and procedures of the System, and as the same may be amended from time to time, and shall not deviate therefrom without our prior written consent.",

You shall generally follow our policies, practices, and procedures, but may deviate if you deem necessary for business purposes.",
                "explanation": "The modified text contradicts the franchisee's obligation to devote \"all of your time, attention and best efforts\" by changing it to \"reasonable time and effort.\" This introduces ambiguity and weakens franchisor control over operational standards.",

The original text enforces compliance with governmental and industry standards, which the modified text fails to do. This creates a contradiction that significantly reduces franchisor control.",

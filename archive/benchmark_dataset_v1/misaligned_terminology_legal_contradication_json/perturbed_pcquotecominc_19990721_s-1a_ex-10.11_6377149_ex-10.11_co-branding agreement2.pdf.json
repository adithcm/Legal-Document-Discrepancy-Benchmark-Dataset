(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The term \"Term\" which typically means the duration of the contract, has been replaced with 'Duration'. While seemingly similar, 'Term' has established legal precedents regarding contract law and enforceability, especially concerning termination clauses. 'Duration' is less defined and could cause confusion in legal interpretation, creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the amendment applies to ALL subsidiaries and related companies. The modified text restricts this to SOME subsidiaries \"as PCQ determines appropriate.\" This introduces a contradiction because it allows PCQ to selectively apply the amendment, potentially violating legal principles requiring consistent application of contractual terms to all related entities.",

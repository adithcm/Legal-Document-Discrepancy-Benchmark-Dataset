                "changed_text": "1.5\n\"Calendar Day\" shall mean any day, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Dutch generally recognized public holidays.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Calendar Day\" includes all days of the week and public holidays, providing a comprehensive timeframe. By modifying the definition to exclude Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays, a contradiction is introduced. This is because many legal and regulatory contexts, particularly in the Netherlands, treat calendar days as inclusive for deadlines and time-sensitive obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract interpretation and Dutch law regarding deadlines and timeframes.",

                "changed_text": "1.15\n\"Hosting Service(s)\" shall mean some of the network hosting (and related) services - as may be listed in Appendix 1 - provided by T-Mobile to ELEPHANT\nTALK under the Agreement, enabling ELEPHANT TALK to provide ELEPHANT TALK Wholesale Services to ELEPHANT TALK\nCustomers in accordance with T-Mobile's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'the network hosting services as listed in Appendix 1' to 'some of the network hosting services as may be listed in Appendix 1' and stating that the services are provided 'in accordance with T-Mobile's discretion,' the original obligation for T-Mobile to provide specific services is weakened and made ambiguous. This creates a legal contradiction because the original contract intends to establish a defined set of services, while the modification allows for discretionary provision, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"shall\" to \"may try to\", \"as described\" to \"maybe described\", and removing certainty from the phrase 'from the Ready for Service Date' to 'potentially from the Ready for Service Date', T-Mobile's obligation to provide the hosting services is undermined. This creates a contradiction with the agreement's intent to ensure the provision of specific services. This modification introduces uncertainty in enforcement because it is unclear when and if T-Mobile is required to provide the hosting services, which can affect Elephant Talk's ability to fulfill its contractual obligations and business model.",

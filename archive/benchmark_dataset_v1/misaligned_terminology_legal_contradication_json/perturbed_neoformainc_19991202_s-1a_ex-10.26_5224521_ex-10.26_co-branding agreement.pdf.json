                "original_text": "1.1 ADVERTISING shall mean any paid advertisements, links, pointers, sponsorships, buttons, banners, navigation, or any other placements or promotions or similar services or rights on a Site, but excluding Advertising that is not paid for or which is part of an overall partnering or revenue sharing arrangement and any Product Listings.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 ADVERTISING shall mean any advertisements, links, pointers, sponsorships, buttons, banners, navigation, or any other placements or promotions or similar services or rights on a Site, without exceptions.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Advertising' excludes unpaid placements and those within partnerships. By removing this exclusion, the definition now ambiguously includes items that might not be considered advertising under standard marketing and legal definitions, creating uncertainty in revenue sharing and obligations.",

                "changed_text": "1.39 PRODUCT LISTING shall mean a potential listing of a third party's product at a Site. The actual listing and compensation are subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly defines a 'Product Listing' as an exchange for compensation. The modified version introduces ambiguity by suggesting it's only a 'potential listing' and compensation is subject to negotiation. This contradicts the initial intent and creates uncertainty in the contractual obligations related to listing products.",

                "changed_text": "1.46 TRANSACTION FEE shall mean any payments collected by a Party, as determined by the collecting party's internal accounting practices.",
                "explanation": "The original 'Transaction Fee' has a clear definition tied to goods and services, excluding advertising. The modified definition makes it entirely dependent on the 'collecting party's internal accounting practices,' removing any objective standard and potentially allowing arbitrary classification of revenue streams. This contradicts generally accepted accounting principles and weakens enforceability.",

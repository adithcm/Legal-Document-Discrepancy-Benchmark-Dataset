(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”).\nEach capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA.",

(“Supplier”) and Bank of America, N. A, (“Bank of America”), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (“SLCMA”).\nEach capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have a meaning assigned by Supplier.",
                "explanation": "By stating that capitalized terms not defined in the schedule will be assigned a meaning by the Supplier rather than the 'SLCMA' agreement, there is a contradiction. Typically, master agreements like 'SLCMA' define standard terms to ensure consistency. Allowing one party to unilaterally define these terms introduces ambiguity and potential for conflicting interpretations, especially regarding obligations and liabilities.",

                "explanation": "By changing the 'terms and conditions pursuant to which Supplier provides certain Software' to 'general framework', contradicts the initial purpose of defining the software. The clause 'anything that the Supplier decides upon to the Bank of America' eliminates the need for mutual agreement, contradicting standard contract principles.",

                "explanation": "The change regarding 'consideration deemed appropriate by the Supplier alone' contradicts the requirement for mutually agreed upon and 'good and valuable consideration' under contract law. The phrase 'may or may not be part of the SLCMA, as determined by the Supplier' gives the Supplier unilateral power to decide if the attached schedule has any legal effect, undermining the agreement.",

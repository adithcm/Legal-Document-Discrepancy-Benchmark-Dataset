Confidential Information does not include information which: (i) the recipient can demonstrate was already known to it at the time of its receipt hereunder; (ii) is or becomes generally available to the public other than by means of the recipient's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) is independently obtained from a third party whose disclosure violates no duty of confidentiality; or (iv) is independently developed by or on behalf of the recipient without use of or reliance on any Confidential Information furnished to it under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "“Confidential Information” means any and all technical and non-technical information of or related to either Party, including, without limitation, proprietary information, know-how, the NCM Property and Derived Works, and information related to or regarding either Party’s research and development, finances, suppliers, customers, business forecasts, and marketing plans, in whatever form disclosed or made available. Confidential Information includes all information regardless of prior knowledge, public availability, third-party disclosure restrictions, or independent development. ",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' provides explicit exclusions, aligning with standard legal interpretations that consider prior knowledge, public availability, and independent development. By removing these exceptions and stating that all information is confidential regardless of these factors, the modified definition creates a contradiction. This expanded definition is far broader than what courts generally recognize as confidential, potentially making the clause unenforceable and creating uncertainty about what information is genuinely protected. This perturbation affects the obligations of the parties under Article XIII, making the overall scope of confidentiality unclear and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "“Equipment” means all tangible personal property. For the purposes of this agreement, all tangible personal property will be regarded as 'Equipment,' irrespective of usage.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies two types of equipment related to the Digital Cinema Service. The changed definition broadens the term 'Equipment' to 'all tangible personal property,' regardless of its connection to the services provided in the agreement. This creates a contradiction because the contract refers specifically to 'small d Equipment' and 'Big D Equipment' in subsequent sections. By making the definition overly broad, it becomes unclear which items fall under specific contractual obligations related to equipment, such as maintenance, ownership, and installation. This uncertainty can lead to disputes and makes enforcement difficult, especially concerning sections dealing with 'small d Equipment' and 'Big D Equipment.'",

                "original_text": "Section 4.4 Make Goods. In the event either Party fails to satisfy its obligation or other agreement to provide Inventory, the Inventory provided by either Party deviates from the standards imposed under this Agreement, or Inventory is not transmitted or exhibited as part of the Service due to the inadvertence, negligence or fault of either Party (as may result, for example, from the failure by either party to supply or maintain equipment or other technology necessary for transmission of the Service as required hereunder), then the Party not at fault may, as its sole and exclusive remedy therefor, require that the other Party, at its sole expense, deliver “make goods” sufficient to achieve the level of Inventory content impressions which would have occurred but for the inadvertence, negligence or fault of the other Party.",

In the event either Party fails to satisfy its obligation or other agreement to provide Inventory, the Inventory provided by either Party deviates from the standards imposed under this Agreement, or Inventory is not transmitted or exhibited as part of the Service, then the Party not at fault will have no further remedy or recourse.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'make goods' as a remedy when one party fails to provide inventory. The modified text removes the obligation to provide 'make goods' altogether and states the non-breaching party has 'no further remedy or recourse' which is in contradiction of this existing contract, as it removes a specified remedy for breach. This lack of recourse significantly alters the risk allocation and weakens the enforceability of obligations related to inventory provision. This modification contradicts the established remedy, leading to legal uncertainty and potentially unenforceable obligations. The absence of a clear remedy makes it difficult to ensure consistent performance and undermines the contract's reliability.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with construction laws and regulations, which is a legal requirement. The changed text replaces this with meeting 'Party A's standards,' which may or may not align with legal requirements. This creates uncertainty as to whether the project will actually comply with applicable laws, contradicting the intention of legally compliant construction.",

                "explanation": "The original contract uses 'legal construction cost' as the basis for fee calculation, a defined term. The revised text makes the fees 'subject to Party A's discretion', potentially conflicting with regulations regarding fair compensation and creating uncertainty about the actual payment owed, potentially leading to contract unenforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compulsory arbitration, a legally binding dispute resolution method. The altered text proposes 'non-binding mediation,' a method where the outcome is only advisory.

                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" as used in this Agreement shall mean any entity that has a business relationship with either PrimeCall or DeltaThree, regardless of control or ownership.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' adheres to the standard legal definition involving control. The modified definition broadens the term to include any entity with a business relationship, regardless of control, which contradicts the established legal understanding of 'Affiliate.' This could lead to disputes over which entities are bound by the terms applicable to affiliates within the agreement.",

All agreements with respect to the printing of the Calling Cards shall be approved in advance by DeltaThree. DeltaThree shall reimburse PrimeCall for all costs incurred by PrimeCall in connection with the manufacturing and printing of the Calling Cards.",
                "changed_text": "PrimeCall will provide printing services for DeltaThreeâ€™s Calling Cards at a 'mutually agreeable' price. Agreements will be made in 'good faith' with no advance approval. DeltaThree shall reimburse PrimeCall for manufacturing costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates advance approval of printing agreements by DeltaThree. The modified version removes the approval requirement by DeltaThree to replace it with the term, 'mutually agreeable'. This introduces ambiguity, as 'mutually agreeable' lacks a precise legal definition compared to the more concrete requirement of advance approval. The new change creates a legal contradiction about the degree of approval power.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a 30-day cure period for material breaches. The modified version removes the cure period entirely. This change contradicts general contract law principles that often allow a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination is permitted, particularly for complex commercial agreements. By omitting the cure period, the contract deviates from standard legal expectations.",

                "original_text": "“Applicable Laws” means any and all (i) laws, statutes, rules, regulations, by laws, codes, treaties, constitutions and ordinances, including Privacy Legislation (“Laws”), (ii) order, directive, judgment, decree, award or writ of any court (including a court of equity), arbitrator or arbitration panel, or any Governmental Authority or other body exercising adjudicative, regulatory, judicial or quasi-judicial powers, including any stock exchange (“Orders”), and (iii) policies, guidelines, standards, requirements, notices and protocols of any Governmental Authority (“Policies”); which are applicable to or govern CHT, Ehave or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "“Applicable Laws” means only the direct statutes explicitly named in this agreement, and no others. This explicitly excludes common law, judicial precedents, or any form of regulatory guidance unless specifically listed herein. This definition exclusively governs CHT, Ehave, and all transactions referenced in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By severely restricting the definition of 'Applicable Laws' to only named statutes, the contract now conflicts with the standard legal understanding that 'Applicable Laws' includes a broad range of legal authorities. This creates uncertainty about compliance and enforceability. It's against the normal legal and business practices in Ontario, Canada.",

                "changed_text": "“Confidential Information” means only that information explicitly marked as 'Confidential' in writing by the disclosing party at the time of disclosure, and nothing else. This definition will exclude all information disclosed verbally, data inferred from observations, and any data that is not physically stamped with the word 'Confidential' on each page or electronic file.",
                "explanation": "This significantly narrows the definition of 'Confidential Information'. Standard legal definitions, and common business practice, include much more than explicitly marked documents. This change encourages unintentional disclosure and disputes over what constitutes confidential information.",

                "explanation": "While the original contract states the agreement will last in perpetuity unless otherwise terminated, this modification suggests that the contract can be terminated at any time without notice, contradicting standard legal practices about the necessity of cause or notice of termination for contracts.",

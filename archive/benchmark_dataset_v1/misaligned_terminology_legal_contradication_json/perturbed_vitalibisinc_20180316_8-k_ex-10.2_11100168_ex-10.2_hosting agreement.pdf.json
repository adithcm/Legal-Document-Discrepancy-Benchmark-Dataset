                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "VOTOCAST shall use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of Licensee and Licensee Users and the content that is transmitted through the Services. VOTOCAST will only access and disclose information as necessary to comply with applicable laws and government orders or requests, to provide the Services, to operate or maintain its systems or to protect itself or Licensee Users.",
                "changed_text": "VOTOCAST may, at its discretion, use efforts it deems reasonable to protect the privacy of Licensee and Licensee Users and the content that is transmitted through the Services. VOTOCAST will access and disclose information when it deems necessary, regardless of applicable laws and government orders or requests, and to operate or maintain its systems or to protect itself or Licensee Users.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by suggesting VOTOCAST's actions regarding privacy are discretionary, which conflicts with data protection laws like GDPR or CCPA that mandate specific privacy obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable privacy laws",
                "location": "Section 2.1"

                "original_text": "In the event of any loss or interruption of Services solely due to VOTOCAST controlled activities. Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and VOTOCAST'S sole and exclusive liability for any loss or interruption of Services shall be as follows. For loss or interruption of Services which is not due to scheduled maintenance, and is caused by VOTOCAST, and such loss or interruption of Services exceeds a continual period of one (I) hour per Exhibit C, Licensee shall receive a credit against future Services equal to one-thirtieth (1/30) of the monthly fees for the Services for each cumulative hour, up to a maximum total of the fees charged for Services for the applicable month of the affected Services.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any loss or interruption of Services due to VOTOCAST activities, Licensee's sole remedy shall be decided solely at the discretion of VOTOCAST. For loss or interruption of Services, Licensee may receive a credit against future Services, the amount to be determined by VOTOCAST.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original text by removing the defined metrics and specific formula for service credit. This creates ambiguity and makes the clause unenforceable. It also gives VOTOCAST absolute discretion, which may not be permissible under contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of definiteness and enforceability",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflict or choice of law principles. The Parties hereto agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action under this Agreement shall be the state and federal courts sitting in California, and each of the Parties hereby agrees and submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such purpose.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by principles of fairness and mutual benefit as determined by the parties, irrespective of any specific jurisdiction. The Parties agree that any disputes will be resolved through amicable discussions, and courts sitting anywhere in the world shall have jurisdiction depending on where the dispute arises.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the choice of law and jurisdiction clause. It removes the specific reference to California law and replaces it with a vague standard. It also opens up jurisdiction to courts globally, making the agreement ambiguous and potentially unenforceable as it relates to legal jurisdiction.",

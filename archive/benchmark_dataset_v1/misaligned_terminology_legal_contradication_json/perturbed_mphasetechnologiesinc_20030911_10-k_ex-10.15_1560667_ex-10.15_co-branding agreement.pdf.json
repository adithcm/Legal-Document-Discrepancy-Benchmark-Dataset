                "original_text": "mPhase agrees to abide by the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of this Agreement specifying the dimensions, requirements and specifications, and the review process related to use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo. mPhase understands that these guidelines may be updated from time to time and agrees to abide by those updates as well as the guidelines provided herein.",
                "changed_text": "mPhase agrees to consider the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of this Agreement specifying the dimensions, requirements and specifications, and the review process related to use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo. mPhase acknowledges that these guidelines may be updated occasionally and agrees to generally be aware of these updates, but adherence is not mandatory.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates adherence to the co-branding guidelines. The modified text changes 'abide' to 'consider' and removes the mandatory aspect, creating uncertainty about whether mPhase must actually follow the guidelines, conflicting with standard contract law requiring clear obligations. This introduces ambiguity where clarity is needed to enforce compliance.",

                "original_text": "In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent's rights to the mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may upon written notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the opinion of Lucent, may possibly inconvenience Lucent's rights to the mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may at their discretion provide a suggestion to mPhase; and only upon further review from both parties, termination of the agreement is considered.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows Lucent to terminate the agreement if mPhase's use of the logo 'adversely affect Lucent's rights'. The modified text weakens 'adversely affect' to 'possibly inconvenience', and changes the action from 'terminate this Agreement' to 'provide a suggestion'. Further review by both parties is required before a 'termination of the agreement is considered', creating ambiguity about the conditions under which termination is actually possible. This contradicts the original clear termination clause and introduces uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement 'shall terminate' in the event of significant changes. The modified text states that the agreement 'may be reviewed' in the event of 'any change', not just significant, and bankruptcy consideration rather than proceedings. This removes the clear termination clause and replaces it with a vague review process, creating uncertainty about the actual consequences of such events. This weakens the enforceability of the termination clause, and removes the meaning of 'significant' from the original text.",

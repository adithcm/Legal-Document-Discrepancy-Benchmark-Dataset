                "original_text": "Purchase Order(s), order acknowledgements and similar form documents evidencing the purchase or sale of Products, including any terms and conditions contained or referenced therein, shall not supersede, add to or amend in any way this Contract. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Contract and the terms of any Purchase Order, order acknowledgement or similar document the terms of this Contract shall prevail.",

In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Contract and the terms of any Purchase Order, order acknowledgement or similar document the terms of Purchase Order shall prevail.",
                "explanation": "This directly contradicts established contract law principles where a master agreement generally takes precedence over individual purchase orders. By stating purchase orders supersede the contract, it creates legal uncertainty about which terms govern, especially considering the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) which guides contract interpretation.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may, but are not required to' and removing the 'good faith' requirement, the obligation to renegotiate is removed and the ethical obligation is changed. This creates ambiguity and contradicts the concept of good faith negotiation which is often implied in commercial contracts under common law, and some state statutes.",

                "explanation": "By replacing the clear requirement of conforming to 'standard sales specifications' with a vague and subjective statement of 'attempt to vaguely resemble ExxonMobil Selling Affiliates' general idea of what sales specifications might be,' the clause becomes unenforceable. This contradicts the basic principles of contract law, which require clear and definite terms, as required by the UCC.",

                "explanation": "By stating that the NFL logo is used on 'some' products and 'at the company's discretion' creates ambiguity, and no signatures are required contradicts the original agreement which clearly defines that ALL licensed products will use the NFL logo, and require all signatures for amendment. The agreement becomes unenforceable due to a lack of clarity on which products are endorsed and which are not.",

Where the following per Unit conversion shall apply for the term of this\nAgreement:",
                "explanation": "By adding 'if the company decides' introduces a condition that contradicts the original intent of a mandatory donation per unit sold. Adding 'will be based on the company's discretion and decision when they want to start the donation, and for how long' makes the payment entirely discretionary, undermining the financial commitment outlined in the original agreement. This creates uncertainty about whether the NFLA-NC will receive any donations, contradicting the contract's remuneration terms.",

By making the report's release contingent on the Company's desire, the NFLA-NC loses the ability to independently verify sales figures and ensure accurate donation payments. This directly contradicts the intended transparency of the contract.",

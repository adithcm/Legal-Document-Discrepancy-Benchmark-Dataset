                "original_text": "The Servicer will manage, service, administer and collect on the Receivables with reasonable care using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises for all comparable device payment plan agreement receivables that it services for itself or others according to the Servicing Procedures.",
                "changed_text": "The Servicer will manage, service, administer and collect on the Receivables with minimal effort, demonstrating a degree of skill and attention deemed satisfactory by its internal standards, irrespective of the Servicing Procedures.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because it replaces the standard of \"reasonable care\" and adherence to \"Servicing Procedures\" with a subjective standard of \"minimal effort\" and internal satisfaction. This contradicts established legal precedents requiring objective standards of care in servicing agreements.",

                "original_text": "The Servicer may grant extensions, refunds, rebates or adjustments on any Receivable or amend any Receivable according to the Servicing Procedures. However, if the Servicer (i) grants payment extensions resulting in the final payment date of the Receivable being later than the Collection Period immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the latest maturing Class of Notes, (ii) cancels a Receivable or reduces or waives (including with respect to any Upgrade Offer) the remaining Principal Balance under a Receivable or any portion thereof and/or as a result, the monthly payments due thereunder, or (iii) modifies, supplements, amends or revises a Receivable to grant the Obligor under such Receivable a contractual right to upgrade the related Device, it will acquire the affected Receivable solely as described under Section 3.3, unless it is required to take the action by Law.",
                "changed_text": "The Servicer may grant extensions, refunds, rebates or adjustments on any Receivable or amend any Receivable without regard to the Servicing Procedures. However, if the Servicer (i) grants payment extensions, (ii) cancels a Receivable or reduces or waives the remaining Principal Balance under a Receivable or any portion thereof and/or as a result, the monthly payments due thereunder, or (iii) modifies, supplements, amends or revises a Receivable, it will not acquire the affected Receivable unless it is required to take the action by Law.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by removing the requirement to follow 'Servicing Procedures' while also stating that the servicer will not acquire the affected receivable, thus causing uncertainty. Under standard servicing agreements, such significant alterations typically trigger an acquisition requirement to protect the investors, which is now explicitly removed.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"following documents\" to \"some documents,\" removing the \"benefit of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee\" language and eliminating \"reasonable care and according to the Servicing Procedures,\" this modification allows the Custodian discretion. The original version has requirements to ensure responsibility with clearly defined legal definitions; while this change is subjective and open to potential abuse.",

                "original_text": "Area of Non-Competition means the State of Zacatecas, Mexico and the area extending 20 kilometers in all directions from the external boundary of each mineral property owned or controlled by Western Silver or in which Western Silver holds any legal interest, in Mexico, as at the Effective Date,",
                "changed_text": "Area of Non-Competition means the immediate vicinity of Zacatecas, Mexico, where Western Silver has ongoing projects, as determined by the subjective assessment of Glamis.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a clear, objective boundary (20 kilometers from mineral properties). The modified definition replaces this with a subjective and vague term ('immediate vicinity') and gives Glamis the power to define it. This creates uncertainty and contradicts standard legal interpretations of geographical restrictions in non-compete agreements, which require clear and defined boundaries.",

                "changed_text": "Mining Activities means mineral exploration and development activities, but only those that directly compete with Glamis's current operations, as decided by Glamis.",
                "explanation": "The original definition is broad, covering 'any acquisition of mineral rights'. The modified definition narrows it significantly, making it conditional on 'directly compete with Glamis's current operations' and giving Glamis the sole discretion to decide what constitutes direct competition. This contradicts the original intent of preventing any mining activity and introduces ambiguity.",

                "changed_text": "Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for approximately 2 years after the Effective Date, it will endeavor not to, primarily, carry on direct Mining Activities, or advise entities manifestly in competition with Glamis as reasonably determined by Western Copper, in the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly prohibits Western Copper from engaging in Mining Activities or advising others in the Area of Non-Competition for 2 years. The change introduces vagueness by using 'approximately 2 years', 'endeavor not to,' 'primarily,' 'manifestly,' and 'reasonably determined by Western Copper.' The original text intends a strict prohibition while the modified language provides loopholes that weaken enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "1.1.42 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means with respect to the performance of activities under this\nAgreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): good-faith efforts to accomplish such objective which are consistent with what the party deems appropriate. “Commercially\nReasonable Efforts” can require, with respect to a particular task or activity in making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing,\nexporting, developing (including seeking regulatory approvals or applicable pricing or reimbursement approvals) or otherwise\ncommercializing the Product, that a Party: (i) assign responsibility for such task or activity to available employee(s); (ii) set high-level objectives for carrying out such task or activity; and (iii) decide to allocate resources\nto advance progress with respect to such objectives with general timelines; provided, however, that, to\nthe extent that the performance of a Party’s obligations hereunder is affected by the other Party’s breach in performing its\nobligations hereunder, the impact on the first Party of such performance failure by the other Party will not be taken into account in\ndetermining whether the first Party has used its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform any such affected obligations.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts.' The original language implied a standard aligned with industry norms and required specific, measurable objectives. The modified definition introduces subjectivity ('what the party deems appropriate'), relaxes the diligence requirement (available employees), weakens the specificity of objectives, and removes concrete timelines, creating ambiguity in how the term will be legally interpreted and enforced. The shift removes accountability and permits a lower standard of effort.",

                "explanation": "The original text emphasizes the importance of timely performance of Clinical Trials. By removing the condition that the JSC confirms a party failed to use \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" before the other party assumes responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to objectively verify a breach. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as the assumption of responsibilities becomes more discretionary and less tied to a verifiable standard of effort.",

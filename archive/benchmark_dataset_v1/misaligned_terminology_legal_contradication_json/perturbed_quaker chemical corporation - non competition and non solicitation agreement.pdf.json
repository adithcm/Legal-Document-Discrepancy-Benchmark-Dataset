                "explanation": "The term 'control' has a specific legal definition, especially in the context of corporate law and non-compete agreements. Replacing 'control' with 'influence' broadens the scope in a vague way. 'Influence' lacks a clear legal definition. Pennsylvania law typically requires non-compete agreements to be narrowly tailored; this change introduces ambiguity making it harder to enforce, contradicting the intent to restrict competition as narrowly as possible.",

                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “influence” (including the terms “influenced by” and “under common influence with”) means having some impact on the decisions of the management and policies of a Person, whether through communication, relationships, or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'control' provides a clear, legally understood standard. By replacing it with a definition of 'influence' that focuses on 'some impact' through vague means such as 'communication' or 'relationships,' the contract creates significant ambiguity. Pennsylvania courts require clear and unambiguous language in contracts, particularly in restrictive covenants like non-competes. This undermines the enforceability of the non-compete clause.",

                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the “Non-Solicit Period”), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the “Non-Solicit Period”), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) encourage any employee of the Combined Business to consider other employment, or (ii) express interest in hiring any of the employees of the Combined Business.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses well-defined terms like 'induce, solicit, recruit, persuade.' The change to 'encourage to consider other employment' and 'express interest in hiring' broadens the scope. It makes the restriction much vaguer and harder to enforce. Pennsylvania courts require narrowly tailored non-solicitation agreements. The changed text is more open to interpretation and could capture actions that are not traditionally considered solicitation, creating a legal contradiction by deviating from established legal norms in employment law.",

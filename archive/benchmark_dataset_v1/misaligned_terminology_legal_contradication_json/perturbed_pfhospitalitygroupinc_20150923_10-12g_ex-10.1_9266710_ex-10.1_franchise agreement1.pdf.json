                "original_text": "“Gross Revenues” means all revenue from the sale of all services and products and all other income of every kind and nature related to, derived from, or originating from the Franchised Business, including proceeds of any business interruption insurance policies, whether for cash or credit, and regardless of collection in the case of credit; provided, however, that “Gross Revenues” does not include any coupon sales (for which customers do not pay for product), customer refunds, sales taxes or other taxes you collected from customers and actually transmitted to the appropriate taxing authorities.",
                "changed_text": "“Gross Revenues” means all revenue from the sale of all services and products and all other income of every kind and nature related to, derived from, or originating from the Franchised Business, including proceeds of any business interruption insurance policies, whether for cash or credit, and regardless of collection in the case of credit; provided, however, that “Gross Revenues” does not include any coupon sales (for which customers do not pay for product), customer refunds, and taxes collected from customers, regardless of whether you transmitted such amounts to the appropriate taxing authorities.",
                "explanation": "By removing the stipulation that sales taxes and other taxes collected from customers are excluded from gross revenues *only if* they are actually transmitted to taxing authorities, the definition now conflicts with standard accounting practices and potentially tax laws. Gross revenue has a specific legal and financial meaning, and this modified definition now includes collected tax amounts regardless of remittance, changing its fundamental meaning and creating a contradiction.",

                "original_text": "The Operating Principal must own a majority of the voting and ownership interests in the franchisee entity, unless you obtain our prior written approval for the Operating Principal to hold a smaller interest. The Operating Principal must complete our training program, must have authority over all business decisions related to the Franchised Business, and must have the power to bind you in all dealings with us.",
                "changed_text": "The Operating Principal must own a minimum of ten percent of the voting and ownership interests in the franchisee entity. The Operating Principal must complete our training program, must have influence over some business decisions related to the Franchised Business, and must have some power to participate in some dealings with us.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the required ownership stake and diluting the authority of the Operating Principal, this change introduces significant ambiguity and contradiction. The original clause stipulated clear ownership and decision-making authority, ensuring accountability. The modified clause replaces this with a much weaker standard, creating uncertainty as to who truly controls the franchise and undermining the franchisor's ability to enforce compliance. This contradiction could lead to legal disputes over the Operating Principal's actual responsibilities and powers.",

                "explanation": "This change fundamentally alters the standard of maintenance and introduces a contradiction. The original clause mandated adherence to the franchisor's specific standards. The modified clause replaces this with a subjective \"reasonable degree\" standard based on the franchisee's \"own best judgment.\" This directly contradicts the franchisor's right to control brand standards and uniformity across franchises, potentially leading to inconsistent quality and damage to the brand's reputation. 'Reasonable' is open to wide interpretation, which deviates from the contract's intentions.",

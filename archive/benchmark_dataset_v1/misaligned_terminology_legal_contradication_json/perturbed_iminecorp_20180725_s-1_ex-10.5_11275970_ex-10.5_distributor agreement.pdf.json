                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Territory' is Taiwan. Changing this to Taipei creates a contradiction, as the agreement later refers to sales and compliance within the 'Territory.' Limiting the territory to Taipei when the rest of the contract implies Taiwan creates uncertainty and potential breach of contract.",

Section 10.1 says there's no warranty from JRVS, but 10.2 implies a discretionary warranty, against Taiwan's Consumer Protection Act which has mandatory warranty regulations for products sold in Taiwan.",

                "explanation": "Initially, the contract specified that prices are 'exclusive' of taxes, and if JRVS pays those taxes, they must itemize them. Changing 'exclusive' to 'inclusive' and 'shall itemize' to 'may or may not itemize' creates contradiction. Furthermore, changing 'valid tax exemption certificate' to 'tax waiver form' creates further ambiguity as tax exemption certificates are legally recognized documents, whereas tax waiver form is not. This creates legal uncertainty in regards to tax responsibilities under Taiwan's tax laws.",

                "original_text": "Fox grants to Licensee a limited, non-exclusive right and license to distribute the following Wireless Products in connection with the Property “ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN” in the United States: (A) 2 Scrat voicetones; (B) 2 John Leguizamo voicetones; and (C) 3 premium videos.

Fox also grants Licensee an unrestricted, non-exclusive license to distribute any Wireless product at their discretion in connection with the Property “ICE AGE 2” outside of the United States: (A) 4 Scrat voicetones; (B) 1 John Leguizamo voicetone; and (C) 3 premium videos. (collectively, “IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products”)",
                "explanation": "The original agreement grants a 'limited, non-exclusive right' which is commonly understood and legally defensible. Changing this to a 'comprehensive, exclusive right' and 'unrestricted, non-exclusive license' creates a contradiction. Exclusive rights grant sole permission, while non-exclusive allows others. The change introduces ambiguity, undermining the agreement's clarity about distribution rights. The phrase 'at their discretion' also introduces the potential for abuse and challenges in enforcing the terms.",

                "original_text": "Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee shall pay to Fox, or such other party as Fox may designate in writing, a royalty in the following amount:\n(a) From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee’s Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "changed_text": "Royalty: In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee pursuant to this Amendment 2, Licensee may, at their discretion, offer Fox a gratuity, which may or may not be considered a royalty, paid to Fox, or such other party as Fox may arbitrarily designate. \n(a) There is no guarantee or defined amount for gratuity. Fox may or may not earn any percentage of Licensee’s Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee’s sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. If the parties agree in writing the rate of percentage can be retroactively renegotiated.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'royalty' with 'gratuity' and making its payment discretionary, the contract now contradicts the established understanding of royalty payments, which are legally defined as a fixed percentage of revenue. Adding that there is no guarantee for the amount further undermines the legally required terms, creating uncertainty in enforcement and royalty obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause ensures that unchanged parts of the agreement remain valid and enforceable. Changing 'expressly' to 'ambiguously,' 'necessary' to 'potential,' and adding conditions that enable Fox to pause or terminate based on market conditions or Fox's consideration directly contradicts the intent of the original clause, creating uncertainty and challenges in upholding the agreement.",

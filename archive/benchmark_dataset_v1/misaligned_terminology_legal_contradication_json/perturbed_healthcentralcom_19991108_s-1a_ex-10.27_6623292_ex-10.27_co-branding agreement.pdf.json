                "original_text": "Subject to paragraph 6, MediaLinx shall be entitled to sell advertising and sponsorships on all pages of the Co-Branded Site to Canadian advertisers (for the purposes of this Agreement \"Canadian advertisers\" shall be advertisers with substantial places of business in Canada) and HCI shall be entitled to sell advertising and sponsorships on all pages of the Co-Branded Site to US advertisers (for the purposes of this Agreement, US advertisers shall be advertisers with substantial places of business in the United States).",
                "changed_text": "Subject to paragraph 6, MediaLinx shall be entitled to sell advertising and sponsorships on all pages of the Co-Branded Site to Canadian advertisers (for the purposes of this Agreement \"Canadian advertisers\" shall be advertisers who occasionally conduct business in Canada) and HCI shall be entitled to sell advertising and sponsorships on all pages of the Co-Branded Site to US advertisers (for the purposes of this Agreement, US advertisers shall be advertisers who infrequently conduct business in the United States).",
                "explanation": "The change replaces \"substantial places of business\" with \"occasionally conduct business\" for Canadian advertisers and \"infrequently conduct business\" for U.S. advertisers, creating a legal contradiction. The original definition implies a significant business presence, while the altered definitions are vague. This introduces ambiguity, as it doesn't specify the extent or nature of business activities required to qualify as a 'Canadian' or 'US' advertiser, thus conflicting with the legal understanding that requires a clear definition.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the data must be collected and used in accordance with privacy laws. The revised text indicates the data is used at the discretion of both parties, essentially ignoring the Canadian and U.S. privacy laws.

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states no partnership or similar relationship is created. The changed text introduces uncertainty by suggesting the agreement may imply such a relationship. This contradicts the initial clear statement of independent contractor status, creating a potential legal ambiguity regarding the nature of the relationship. The reclassification could be used to enforce different labor laws.",

                "original_text": "“Affiliate” means, when used with respect to any specified Person, a Person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such specified Person. For the purposes of this definition, “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) with respect to the relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the possession, directly or indirectly or as trustee, personal representative or executor, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the affairs or management of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, as trustee, personal representative or executor, by contract, credit arrangement or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "“Affiliate” means, when used with respect to any specified Person, a Person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, has a business association with such specified Person. For the purposes of this definition, “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) with respect to the relationship between or among two or more Persons, means merely having a contractual relationship.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' uses the legally recognized term 'control,' which involves the power to direct management or affairs, usually through ownership or contractual means. The modified definition significantly weakens this by stating that merely having a 'business association' constitutes being an affiliate and equates 'control' to simply having 'a contractual relationship'. This contradicts the standard legal understanding of 'control' and 'affiliate' relationships under PRC law, which generally requires a higher degree of influence or ownership.",

                "changed_text": "“Licensed Content” shall mean any Content that Licensor provides to Licensee. Licensor has complete discretion over what constitutes licensed content.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Licensed Content' ties it to copyright ownership and sublicensing rights, which have clear legal implications under copyright law. The modified definition broadens it to 'any Content that Licensor provides,' giving Licensor complete discretion. This creates a legal contradiction because it eliminates the requirement of copyright ownership or the ability to sublicense, potentially including content that Licensor has no legal right to provide. It may violate PRC Copyright Law if Licensor provides content they do not have the right to license.",

Licensee shall monitor and censor all Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including without limitation Content posted by end users. Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority.",

Licensee may choose to monitor and censor some Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names. Licensee will remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any materials Licensor finds disagreeable.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that the licensee *shall* monitor and censor all content, and the licensee will remove the content within the timeframe from the governmental authority. The modified clause changes 'shall' to 'may choose to' and removes the condition about the timeframe, giving Licensee the choice to monitor content, and the requirement to remove content within the timeframe from the governmental authority. This directly contradicts regulatory mandates in the PRC regarding internet content censorship, potentially resulting in legal liability for both parties. This creates uncertainty in enforcement by making a critical obligation discretionary.",

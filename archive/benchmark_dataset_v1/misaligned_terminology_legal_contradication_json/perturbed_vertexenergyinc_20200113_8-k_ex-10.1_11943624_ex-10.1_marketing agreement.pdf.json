                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "“Business Day” means any day except a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal Reserve Bank holiday. A Business Day shall open at 8:00a.m. and close at 5:00p.m. Houston, Texas, time.",
                "changed_text": "“Business Day” means any weekday. A Business Day’s operational hours are at the discretion of Bunker One.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Business Day' aligns with common legal and business practices, specifying exclusions (weekends, holidays) and precise hours. The modification introduces ambiguity by removing specific exclusions and granting Bunker One discretion over operational hours. This creates potential conflict and uncertainty, as the term's interpretation now relies on Bunker One's subjective determination, deviating from the established definition that typically includes federal holidays and specific hours. This contradicts established legal norms for defining 'Business Day,' potentially impacting deadlines and obligations.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties agree that tank/storage fees shall be allocated as deemed appropriate by Bunker One, with Vertex bearing a share not exceeding 75% of such fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that tank/storage fees 'shall be for the account of the JSMA,' implying a mutual responsibility or a predefined allocation method related to the joint activities. The modified version gives Bunker One the power to unilaterally decide on allocation, up to 75% to Vertex. This directly contradicts the initial agreement, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes. The statutory definition of contract disputes requires clarity.",

                "original_text": "Payment by Bunker One for the Product, as defined in clause 2.1, will be made by wire transfer within three (3) Business Days after the date Vertex invoices Bunker One, to an account desig- nated from time to time by Vertex.",
                "changed_text": "Payment by Bunker One for the Product, as defined in clause 2.1, will be made according to Bunker One’s payment schedule, to an account designated from time to time by Vertex.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly specifies a 3-Business Day payment term after invoicing, providing certainty and predictability. The changed text replaces this with 'Bunker One’s payment schedule,' making the payment term undefined and subject to Bunker One's discretion. This creates a conflict because the defined payment term is removed, introducing ambiguity, and undermining the legal principle of 'certainty of terms' in contract law. State laws typically require that contracts outline payment terms clearly to prevent disputes.",

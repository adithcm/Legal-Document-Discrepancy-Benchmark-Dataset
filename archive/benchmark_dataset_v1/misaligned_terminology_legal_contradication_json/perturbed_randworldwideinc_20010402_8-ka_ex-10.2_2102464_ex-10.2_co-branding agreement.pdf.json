                "explanation": "The term 'Control' has a specific legal definition concerning the power to direct management, while 'Influence' is far more ambiguous.

                "explanation": "The term 'Representations and Warranties' are changed into 'Mutual Understandings'. Also, 'proprietary or trade secret information' changed to 'confidential information'. This change dilutes the legal weight of these assurances. 'Representations and warranties' are legally binding statements of fact; 'understandings' are not.

                "explanation": "Replacing 'expenses' with 'financial burdens' and 'shall' to 'may decide whether or not bear' introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of this provision. 'Expenses' is a clear, objective term. 'Financial burdens' is more subjective. Also, 'shall' indicates a mandatory obligation, but 'may decide whether or not bear' makes it optional. This could lead to disputes about who is responsible for costs associated with the agreement.",

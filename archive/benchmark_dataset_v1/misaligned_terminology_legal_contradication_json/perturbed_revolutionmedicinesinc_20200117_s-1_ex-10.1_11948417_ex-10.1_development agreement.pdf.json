                "changed_text": "“Commercially Reasonable Efforts” means: (a) with respect to Sanofi, exerting effort that is merely more than perfunctory, taking into account their internal business objectives and (b) with respect to RevMed, minimal effort to merely satisfy their obligations under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" is tailored to each party, considering factors like profitability and market potential. The modified definition significantly lowers the standard for both Sanofi and RevMed, particularly for RevMed, potentially allowing them to avoid investing fully in the collaboration without technically breaching the contract. This misalignment creates uncertainty regarding the level of commitment expected from each party.",

                "changed_text": "1.22 “Control” or “Controlled” means, with respect to any item of Know-How, Patent Right, other intellectual property right or Regulatory Material, a Party's vague awareness of the item's existence.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Control' provides a clear and detailed understanding of what constitutes control over intellectual property. The modification replaces this clear definition with a vague concept of awareness. This creates a contradiction because 'Control' is used throughout the agreement to define rights and obligations related to intellectual property. The modified definition makes it difficult to determine when a Party actually 'Controls' an item, leading to uncertainty about their obligations to grant licenses or access.",

Sales prior to receipt of Marketing Approval for such Product, such as so-called “treatment IND sales,” “named patient sales,” and “compassionate use sales,” shall not be construed as a First Commercial Sale.",
                "changed_text": "1.37 “First Commercial Sale” means, with respect to any Product in any country or jurisdiction, any sale, regardless of whether it is for monetary value or has received marketing approval.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'First Commercial Sale' clearly links it to a sale for monetary value after marketing approval. The modified definition removes both conditions, specifying any sale as a First Commercial Sale. This creates a conflict because it could trigger royalty obligations and other contractual terms prematurely or inappropriately. 'First Commercial Sale' is a key milestone that triggers numerous financial and operational obligations, making the modified definition significantly disrupt the contractual scheme.",

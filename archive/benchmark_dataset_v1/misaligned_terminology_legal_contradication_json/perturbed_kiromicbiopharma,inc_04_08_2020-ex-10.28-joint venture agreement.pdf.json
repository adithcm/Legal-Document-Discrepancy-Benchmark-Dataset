                "original_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall grant each other, free of charge, a non-exclusive right to use their respective Backgrounds in connection with the activities which will be carried out by this JV and by reason of their execution. This right is granted for the duration of the Agreement only, with the express denial of sublicensing or transferring it to any third party for any reason whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall grant each other, free of charge, a non-exclusive right to use their respective Backgrounds in connection with the activities which will be carried out by this JV and by reason of their execution. This right is granted for the duration of the Agreement, including the right to sublicense or transfer it to any third party.",
                "explanation": "The original text expressly denies sublicensing or transferring rights to a third party. The modified text directly contradicts this by granting the right to sublicense or transfer. This creates a legal contradiction concerning intellectual property rights, making the enforceability uncertain, especially regarding third-party involvement.",

                "original_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. Any such arbitration shall (i) be subject to the application of the Italian Law, (ii) take place in Paris, France and (iii) be conducted in English.",
                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement may be resolved through mediation, arbitration, or litigation, at the sole discretion of Kiromic Biopharma. If arbitration is chosen, the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce will not apply. The process will be governed by the procedural rules determined solely by Kiromic Biopharma, and will take place in Houston, Texas and (iii) be conducted in English.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates ICC arbitration under Italian Law in Paris. The modified text allows Kiromic to choose mediation, arbitration, or litigation, contradicting the mandated arbitration and choice of law. Further, it removes the ICC rules, allows for internal procedural rules by Kiromic, and changes the venue to Houston, introducing multiple conflicts that compromise the initial dispute resolution framework.",

                "original_text": "The Parties shall keep confidential any information exchanged between them in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this JV AgreementÍ¾ it is agreed that these confidentiality obligations shall not apply with respect to any information which:\n(a) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of an unauthorised disclosure by a Party,\n(b) was available to a Party prior to its disclosure by the other Party,\n(c) is disclosed pursuant to a requirement of a court or other public authority or for the purpose of enforcing the rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall keep confidential any information exchanged between them in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this JV Agreement; however, Kiromic Biopharma reserves the right to disclose any information deemed necessary for its business operations, regardless of its confidential nature. Exceptions to confidentiality apply only when Kiromic Biopharma explicitly consents in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines specific exceptions to confidentiality. The modified text gives Kiromic a broad right to disclose confidential information for 'business operations,' directly contradicting the specified exceptions. This undermines the confidentiality clause, potentially violating trade secret laws and creating enforceability issues due to the vagueness of 'business operations'.",

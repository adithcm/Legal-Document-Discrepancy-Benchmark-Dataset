                "original_text": "(c) “Affiliate(s)” shall mean an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with a party. \"Control,\" for purposes of this definition, means direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 50% of the voting interests of the subject entity.",
                "changed_text": "(c) “Affiliate(s)” shall mean an entity vaguely associated with a party. \"Control,\" for purposes of this definition, means potential influence over the actions of the subject entity.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliate(s)\" provided a clear threshold of ownership (more than 50% of voting interests) to define control. The modified version replaces this with \"vaguely associated\" and \"potential influence\", terms that lack legal precision. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard definitions of affiliate relationships used in corporate law, leading to potential disputes about the scope of affiliated entities covered by the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "(a) The Term of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall commence on the Effective Date listed above and continue for approximately twenty (20) years, unless sooner terminated as provided in Section 7(b).",
                "explanation": "Changing \"twenty (20) years\" to \"approximately twenty (20) years\" introduces a contradiction because it makes the contract term indefinite. Contracts require specific terms, and 'approximately' undermines the enforceability and clarity of the agreement. There is no precise standard to define what 'approximately' means, creating confusion and potential legal challenges about the duration of the agreement, especially concerning obligations and rights that extend over the 'Term'.",

It has all rights and authority necessary to fully perform its obligations and grant the rights granted under this Agreement and all rights in and to the Titles and in and to all literary, artistic, dramatic, intellectual property and musical material included therein required for the exercise of rights granted in this Agreement without liability of any kind to any third party; provided however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to non-dramatic performing rights in music to the extent that they are controlled by SESAC, ASCAP or BMI or to the extent that such music is in the public domain;",

It believes it has all rights and authority necessary to fully perform its obligations and grant the rights granted under this Agreement and all rights in and to the Titles and in and to all literary, artistic, dramatic, intellectual property and musical material included therein required for the exercise of rights granted in this Agreement without liability of any kind to any third party; provided however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to non-dramatic performing rights in music to the extent that they are controlled by SESAC, ASCAP or BMI or to the extent that such music is in the public domain;",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"It has all rights and authority necessary\" with \"It believes it has all rights and authority necessary\" weakens the warranty provided by the Licensor. A warranty is a guarantee of a fact, and changing it to a belief undermines its enforceability. This introduces a contradiction because the contract initially asserts a definitive right, then dilutes it to a subjective belief, creating uncertainty about the Licensor's actual ownership and control of the licensed content. This could expose the Licensee to copyright infringement claims or other legal liabilities if the Licensor's belief is unfounded.",

                "original_text": "1.11 “Consumer” means, in relation to a product or service or market for a product or service, an individual who takes the product or service for primarily non-business and non-work purposes (even if, for the avoidance of doubt, that individual sometimes, as a secondary purpose, uses the product or service for their work or business).",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Consumer\" specifies usage primarily for \"non-business and non-work purposes.\" The modified definition broadens this to \"any purposes\", directly conflicting with the original intent and creating uncertainty.

                "explanation": "By changing '30%' to '10%', the definition of 'Affiliate' now contradicts established corporate law standards for determining affiliation through shareholding. Many jurisdictions use a higher threshold (like 20% or 25%) to signify significant influence or control. This conflicting definition could lead to disputes regarding which entities are bound by the 'Affiliate' provisions within the contract, especially concerning liability or non-compete clauses.",

                "explanation": "The original definition clearly states \"independent contractors.\" By changing 'independent contractors' to 'workers,' it creates ambiguity and potential conflict with labor laws. Some jurisdictions have specific legal tests (e.g., the 'ABC test' or 'economic realities' test) to determine whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Simply labeling them as 'workers' without adhering to these tests can lead to misclassification and legal challenges.",

                "original_text": "iBio hereby grants to CC-Pharming for the term of this Agreement, a nonexclusive, non- assignable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to use iBio’s Technology in order to manufacture, process, prepare, and obtain regulatory approval for the development and production of Product(s) and work to be performed under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "iBio hereby grants to CC-Pharming for the term of this Agreement, a nonexclusive, transferable, sublicensable, unlimited right and license to use iBio’s Technology in order to manufacture, process, prepare, and obtain regulatory approval for the development and production of Product(s) and work to be performed under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change from “non-assignable, non-sublicensable, limited” to “transferable, sublicensable, unlimited” directly contradicts the original intent of a limited license. This introduces ambiguity regarding the scope of rights granted. This undermines the protections of the original agreement and introduces legal uncertainty about the use and control of iBio’s Technology",

The Project manager for each Party may be contacted regarding some business-related matters, including any proposed modifications to this Agreement, the phasing plan of the SOW, for each project.\nAn iBio Project manager may be named after the Effective Date of the First Phase of the SOW.\nA CC-Pharming Project manager might not be named after the Effective Date of the First Phase of the SOW.",
                "explanation": "The terms “Agreement Administrator” was changed to “Project manager”. This significantly reduces the authority and responsibility implied by the term 'Agreement Administrator,' introducing ambiguity about who is authorized to make decisions or modifications to the agreement. The language change from “must” to “may” regarding contact and naming introduces uncertainty about the roles' existence and involvement, contradicting the original intent of structured agreement administration.",

Each Party is responsible for the direction and compensation of its employees.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a direct contradiction by stating that each party is both an independent contractor and a legal representative/agent of the other. This is a legal impossibility as these roles have conflicting duties and liabilities. It creates uncertainty regarding liability, authority, and the nature of the business relationship.",

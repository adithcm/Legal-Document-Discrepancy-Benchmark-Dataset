                "original_text": "Unless Shipper and Transporter have agreed to a rate other than the maximum rate, rates shall be Transporter's maximum rates and charges plus all applicable surcharges in effect from time to time under the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) on file with the Commission unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing. Provisions governing a Rate other than the maximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto.",
                "changed_text": "Unless Shipper and Transporter have agreed to a rate other than the maximum rate, rates shall be Transporter's suggested rates and charges plus some surcharges in effect at the Transporter's discretion. Provisions governing a Rate other than the maximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'maximum rates' and 'all applicable surcharges in effect from time to time under the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) on file with the Commission' are replaced with more subjective phrases like 'Transporter's suggested rates' and 'some surcharges in effect at the Transporter's discretion'. This creates a contradiction because the original text implies adherence to rates filed with the Commission as per NGA, whereas the modified text suggests rates can be altered at the Transporter's discretion, which could violate NGA if the transporter fails to act within the requirements of law.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall incorporate and in all respects be subject to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time. Transporter may file and seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at any time and from time to time to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) and the \"General Terms and Conditions\" in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, and Transporter shall have the right to place such changes in effect in accordance with the NGA, and this Agreement shall be deemed to include such changes and any such changes",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may incorporate and in some respects be subject to the \"General Terms and Conditions\" and another Rate Schedule which may be internally revised by Transporter. Transporter may, but is not required to, seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at some point to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in another Rate Schedule and the \"General Terms and Conditions\", and Transporter shall have the right to place such changes in effect, and this Agreement will be deemed to include such changes and any such changes",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall incorporate' to 'may incorporate,' 'applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) set forth in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, as may be revised from time to time' to 'another Rate Schedule which may be internally revised by Transporter', and 'may file and seek Commission approval' to 'may, but is not required to, seek Commission approval,' the contract now contradicts the standard regulatory practice under the NGA, which mandates that tariff changes be filed with and approved by the FERC. This change creates uncertainty as to which terms actually apply.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'the laws of the State of Michigan' with 'at the Transporter's discretion' fundamentally alters the legal framework for dispute resolution. This contradicts established legal principles where disputes are resolved based on legal statutes and precedents rather than the arbitrary decision of one party, making the enforcement of this provision highly questionable under established legal standards.",

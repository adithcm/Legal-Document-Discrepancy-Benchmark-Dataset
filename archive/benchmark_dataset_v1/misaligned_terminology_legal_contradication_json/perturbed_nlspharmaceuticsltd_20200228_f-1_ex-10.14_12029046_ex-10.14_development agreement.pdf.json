                "original_text": "Net Sales\nmeans the total of the gross invoice prices of Licensed Products sold or leased by the Licensee, an Affiliate, a Distributor,\nor any combination thereof, less the sum of the following actual and customary deductions where applicable and separately\nlisted: cash, trade, or quantity discounts; sales, use, tariff, import/export duties or other excise taxes imposed on particular\nsales (in particular value-added tax); transportation charges; or credits to customers because of rejections or returns. For\npurposes of calculating Net Sales, transfers to an Affiliate or to a Distributor of Licensed Product under this Agreement for\n(i) end use (but not resale) by the Affiliate shall be treated as sales by Licensee at the list price of the Licensee in an arm-\nlength transaction, or (ii) resale by an Affiliate shall be treated as sales at the list price of the Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "Net Sales\nmeans the total of the gross invoice prices of Licensed Products sold or leased by the Licensee, less only standard deductions.\nStandard deductions will be determined at Licensee’s discretion. For purposes of calculating Net Sales, transfers to an Affiliate\nor to a Distributor of Licensed Product under this Agreement for (i) end use (but not resale) by the Affiliate shall be treated as sales by Licensee at a price determined by Licensee, or (ii) resale by an Affiliate shall be treated as sales at a price offered by the Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Sales' provided a clear and detailed formula for calculation, including specific allowable deductions, providing legal certainty. The revised definition replaces this with vague language such as 'standard deductions' and 'Licensee's discretion,' fundamentally altering the term. This could lead to disputes regarding royalty payments, as the term 'Net Sales' is now open to subjective interpretation, contradicting standard accounting practices. In some jurisdictions, revenue recognition principles require objective and verifiable measures for calculating net sales, further undermining the enforceability of this clause.",

                "changed_text": "Confidential\nInformation\nshall refer to information the parties mutually agree, in writing, to be confidential.",
                "explanation": "The original text refers to Article 18 for the meaning of Confidential Information. The modified text changes the definition to require a separate mutual agreement in writing for each piece of information, thereby contradicting the general definition and Article 18. This drastically narrows the scope of what is considered confidential. Under trade secret laws, such as the Defend Trade Secrets Act in the United States, or similar laws in Brazil and Switzerland, a company must take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of its information. This change makes it difficult to argue that reasonable measures were taken if confidentiality is only determined on a case-by-case basis.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to Article 10.3 for the definition of the Joint Steering Committee. The modified text changes the definition to be an informal advisory group, without decision-making authority, changing and effectively contradicting the role and purpose as initially established. This change affects the governance and oversight mechanisms described elsewhere in the contract. Corporate governance principles require clarity in the roles and responsibilities of committees, and this alteration introduces ambiguity that could undermine the collaborative nature of the agreement.",

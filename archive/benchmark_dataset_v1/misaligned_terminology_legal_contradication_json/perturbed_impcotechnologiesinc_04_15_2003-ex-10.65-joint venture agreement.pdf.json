                "original_text": "“Affiliate(s)” shall mean with respect to any Party to this Agreement any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Party. An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it controls, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.",
                "changed_text": "“Affiliate(s)” shall mean with respect to any Party to this Agreement any entity which seems to be related. An entity controls another entity when it appears to have some influence.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear definition of 'Affiliate' based on equity ownership or control of the board, offering legal certainty. The modified text introduces vague language like 'seems to be related' and 'appears to have some influence.' This creates ambiguity and could lead to disputes over which entities are considered affiliates, impacting obligations and rights under the agreement. Indian company law provides specific definitions of related parties based on shareholding and control; this modification contradicts those established definitions.",

                "changed_text": "4.2   The quorum for a General Meeting shall be two (2) members present in person or through a representative. If within half an hour a quorum is not present, the meeting will proceed regardless.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines quorum requirements for a general meeting, ensuring representation from both IMPCO and MIL/MINDA. It also outlines adjournment procedures if a quorum isn't met. The modified text significantly reduces the quorum requirement and eliminates the need for specific representation from IMPCO and MIL/MINDA, and removes the adjournment clause. This contradicts standard corporate governance practices mandated by the Companies Act, which aims to protect the interests of all shareholders by ensuring adequate representation and preventing decisions made by a small, unrepresentative group.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the Chairman of the Board must be an IMPCO Director and have a casting vote as per the Companies Act. The modified text allows any attendee to be Chairman and grants them five votes, disregarding legal regulations. This directly contradicts the Companies Act provisions regarding board composition, voting rights, and chairman selection, potentially leading to skewed decision-making and disenfranchisement of minority shareholders. This makes the whole governance of the board unconstitutional.",

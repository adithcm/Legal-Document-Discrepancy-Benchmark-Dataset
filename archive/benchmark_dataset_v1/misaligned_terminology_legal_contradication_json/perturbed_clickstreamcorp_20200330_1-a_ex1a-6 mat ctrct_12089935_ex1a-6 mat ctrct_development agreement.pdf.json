                "original_text": "The Developer agrees to perform the Services hereunder solely as an independent contractor. The Parties agree that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, franchise, agency, employer/employee, or similar relationship between the Parties, or as authorizing either Party to act as the agent of the other. The Developer is and will remain an independent contractor in its relationship to the Client.",
                "changed_text": "The Developer agrees to perform the Services hereunder as a contractor. The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be construed as creating a partnership between the Parties, or as authorizing both Parties to act as the agent of the other. The Developer is and will remain an integrated partner in its relationship to the Client.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the developer is an 'integrated partner,' the contract now suggests a partnership, directly conflicting with the intended independent contractor status. This introduces ambiguity regarding liability, tax obligations, and control over the work, potentially leading to legal disputes over worker classification.",

These items shall include, but shall not be limited to, any and all deliverables resulting from the Developer’s Services or contemplated by this Agreement, all tangible results and proceeds of the Services, works in progress, records, diagrams, notes, drawings, specifications, schematics, documents, designs, improvements, inventions, discoveries, developments, trademarks,, licenses, trade secrets, customer lists, databases, software, programs, middleware, applications, and solutions conceived, made, or discovered by the Developer, solely or in collaboration with others, during the Term of this Agreement relating in any manner to the Developer’s Services.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"works for hire and the exclusive property of the Client\" to \"jointly owned Intellectual Property between both parties\", the contract contradicts the legal definition of 'work for hire' under copyright law. Work for hire implies exclusive ownership by the commissioning party, while joint ownership creates ambiguity regarding rights to commercialization, licensing, and modification.",

If litigation results from or arises out of this Agreement or the performance thereof, each Party shall be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees, court costs, and all other expenses, whether or not taxable by the court as costs.",

If litigation results from or arises out of this Agreement or the performance thereof, the losing Party may cover the winning Party’s attorneys’ fees, court costs, and all other expenses, whether or not taxable by the court as costs.",
                "explanation": "By replacing “shall be governed” with “shall be optionally governed”, and “each Party shall be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees” with “the losing Party may cover the winning Party’s attorneys’ fees,” the contract introduces uncertainty regarding choice of law and fee shifting. Contract law dictates that governing law provisions are mandatory for predictability, and this weakens the clause. Also, 'may cover' introduces ambiguity, which would not be definitive enough to be enforced by the state of Florida.",

                "changed_text": "Licensor grants to Rogers the exclusive license and right to distribute and exhibit in Canada (the “Territory”) all entertainment\nprogramming to which Licensor owns or controls the VOD distribution and exhibition rights in the Territory (collectively, “Licensed\nPrograms”) to residential subscribers of Rogers’ digital cable television service on a Video-on-Demand (“VOD”) basis. For clarity, the VOD\nservice that Rogers provides to such subscribers shall hereinafter be referred to as the “ROD Service”.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'non-exclusive' to 'exclusive' directly contradicts the standard definition of a non-exclusive license. A non-exclusive license allows the licensor to grant the same rights to multiple parties, while an exclusive license prohibits this. This change creates ambiguity and potential legal disputes regarding the scope of rights granted to Rogers, conflicting with standard Canadian intellectual property law regarding licensing.",

                "changed_text": "The viewing period for each Licensed Program shall be exactly twenty-four (24) hours, irrespective of any agreement between Rogers and Licensor (the “Viewing Period”). Multiple viewings of the Licensed Program shall be permitted\nduring the Viewing Period, subject to additional fees for each view, and all such viewings shall be considered separate exhibitions of the Licensed Program for\nthe purposes of calculating License Fees hereunder.",
                "explanation": "By stating the Viewing Period is exactly 24 hours and cannot be altered by any agreement between Rogers and Licensor, and also stipulating additional fees for multiple viewings, this directly contradicts the original allowance for flexibility in the viewing period and no additional fees for multiple viewings. This misaligns with basic contract law principles where parties can mutually agree to terms and conditions. This creates a contractual conflict and ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may, at their discretion', the obligation to set off becomes optional for Rogers. In contract law, 'shall' typically indicates a mandatory action, whereas 'may' indicates a permissive action. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes, as it's unclear when Rogers is obligated to perform the set-off, conflicting with established legal interpretations of mandatory versus permissive language in contracts.",

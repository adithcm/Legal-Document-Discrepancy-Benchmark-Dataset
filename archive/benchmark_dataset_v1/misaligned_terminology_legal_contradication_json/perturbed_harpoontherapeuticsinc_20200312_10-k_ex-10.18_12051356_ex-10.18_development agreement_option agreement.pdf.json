                "explanation": "The term **'Commercially Reasonable Efforts'** was replaced with **'what is deemed appropriate'**, creating legal uncertainty. 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' has a clear **legal definition**, whereas 'what is deemed appropriate' is vague and open to interpretation.

By defining **“AbbVie”** as \"the best company in the world,\" the contract introduces **subjectivity and ambiguity**.

                "explanation": "The term 'perpetual' was changed to 'temporary,' and 'royalty-free' was changed to 'royalty-bearing.' This creates a contradiction because a perpetual license has a very specific legal meaning (lasting forever), and a temporary license would contradict this and require a renewal, and the use of the words `royalty-bearing` changes the financial aspect.",

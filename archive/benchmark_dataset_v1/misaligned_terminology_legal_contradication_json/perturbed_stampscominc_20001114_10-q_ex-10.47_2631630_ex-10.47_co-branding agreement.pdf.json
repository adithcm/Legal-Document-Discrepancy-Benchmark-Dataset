                "changed_text": "(aa) \"Update\" shall mean occasional suggestions and optional improvements to the Service.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Update\" clearly refers to bug fixes and maintenance, which are essential for service functionality. The modified definition makes updates optional and suggests they are merely 'suggestions,' conflicting with a standard understanding that software updates include critical fixes required for proper operation. This creates uncertainty about the Company's obligation to maintain the Service, which is a key element under software service agreements.",

                "changed_text": "(c) \"Brand Features\" means any visual element either party chooses to display, without regard to intellectual property protections.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties 'Brand Features' to legally protected trademarks, trade names, etc. The modified definition removes any mention of legal protection, suggesting that either party can use any visual element as a 'Brand Feature' regardless of copyright or trademark laws. This contradicts intellectual property law and creates uncertainty about brand protection within the co-branding agreement.",

                "original_text": "(d) Independent Contractor. Neither party shall, for any purpose, be deemed to be an agent of the other party and the relationship between the parties shall only be that of independent contractors. Neither party shall have any right or authority to assume or create any obligations or to make any representations or warranties on behalf of any other party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "(d) Independent Contractor. For accounting purposes, the relationship between the parties shall be that of independent contractors. However, either party may act on behalf of the other in marketing endeavors.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly defines the relationship as independent contractors for all purposes, preventing one party from acting as an agent of the other. The modification limits this definition to 'accounting purposes' and then allows either party to act on behalf of the other in 'marketing endeavors'. This introduces a contradiction by creating agency within the realm of marketing, blurring the lines of responsibility and potentially exposing one party to liabilities created by the other's marketing actions. The IRS has specific definitions about what an independent contractor can and cannot do and still maintain the independent contractor status.",

                "original_text": "Developer is undertaking the services set forth in this Agreement as an independent contractor, working at Developer's own hours and using Developer's own equipment and at Developer's own chosen place of work, with discretion concerning the revision of Services and Deliverables within Client's general direction. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to constitute the Parties as partners, employees, agents or joint ventures of each other. No Party will have the authority to bind the other Party in any respect.",
                "changed_text": "Developer is undertaking the services set forth in this Agreement as an independent contractor, working under the Client's guidance and using equipment leased from the Client, at a place of work designated by the Client, with limited discretion concerning the revision of Services and Deliverables. This Agreement can be construed to constitute the Parties as joint ventures of each other. The Client will have the authority to bind the Developer in matters related to this project.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines the 'Developer' as an 'independent contractor' with freedom in how the job is executed. The modified text changes key aspects of this relationship, stipulating the developer is working under the Client's guidance and using equipment leased from the Client, among other things. It also states that it can be construed as the Parties being in a joint venture. These changes contradict the established definition of an 'independent contractor' under federal and state labor laws, such as the economic realities test or the IRS guidelines, which emphasize autonomy and control.",

For purposes of this Agreement, Derivatives shall mean: (a) for copyrightable or copyrighted material, any translation, abridgment, revision or other form in which an existing work may be recast, transformed or adapted ;(b) for patentable or patented material, any improvement thereon; and (c) for material which is protected by trade secret, any new material derived from such existing trade secret material, including new material which may be protected under applicable copyright, patent, or trade secret law.",

For purposes of this Agreement, Derivatives shall mean: (a) for copyrightable or copyrighted material, only direct copies of the original work ;(b) for patentable or patented material, only the original invention itself; and (c) for material which is protected by trade secret, only the exact existing trade secret material.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Derivatives' has been narrowed to only include exact copies or the original invention, rather than including translations, revisions, improvements, or new material derived from the original. This contradicts the broad legal understanding of 'derivative works' under copyright law (17 U.S.C. § 101) and trade secret law, where derivative works and improvements are typically protected. By limiting the definition, the contract potentially fails to protect a significant portion of the Disclosing Party's intellectual property.",

                "changed_text": "If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of law to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable: (a) that provision shall be immediately struck down and voided; and (b) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the parties involved, and renegotiated based on the changes",
                "explanation": "The original clause is a severability clause, which ensures that if one part of the contract is deemed invalid, the rest remains in effect. The modified clause states that the invalid provision is 'immediately struck down and voided' and the rest of the contract must be renegotiated. This contradicts the typical interpretation of severability, which aims to preserve as much of the original agreement as possible. This change introduces uncertainty about the enforceability of the entire agreement if any part is challenged, conflicting with standard contract law principles that favor upholding agreements where possible.",

                "original_text": "This Software Maintenance Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into as of October 13, 2016, between Leader Act Ltd HK (“LEADER”), a Nevada Corporation, (hereinafter referred to as “Leader”), and EZJR, Inc. a Nevada corporation, (hereinafter referred to as “EZJR”).",
                "changed_text": "This Software Maintenance Agreement (the “Understanding”) is entered into as of October 13, 2016, between Leader Act Ltd HK (“LEADER”), a Nevada Corporation, (hereinafter referred to as “Leader”), and EZJR, Inc. a Nevada corporation, (hereinafter referred to as “EZJR”).",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Agreement' to 'Understanding' introduces ambiguity. 'Agreement' has a clear legal connotation implying a binding contract, while 'Understanding' is more informal and less legally enforceable. This shift could create doubt about the enforceability of the contract under Nevada law.",

                "changed_text": "LEADER hereby agrees to potentially assist EZJR, its successors, and assigns regarding damage or deficiency resulting from severe miscommunication, possible warranty concerns, or operational difficulties on the part of LEADER under this Understanding.",
                "explanation": "Replacing legal terms like 'indemnify,' 'material misrepresentation,' 'breach of warranty or covenant,' and 'nonfulfillment of any agreement' with vague terms like 'potentially assist,' 'severe miscommunication,' 'possible warranty concerns,' and 'operational difficulties' significantly weakens the legal obligations of LEADER. This creates ambiguity and reduces the enforceability of the indemnification clause under Nevada contract law, as the obligations are no longer clearly defined or binding.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement and any matters arising out of or related to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada. If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree that in any such action, and on all issues, the parties irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such action shall be the State Courts of Nevada.",

If any discussion arises, the parties may consider waiving certain rights. The appropriate location for any discussions will be mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Nevada law, waives jury trial rights, and establishes Nevada courts as the exclusive venue. The modified version removes these specific legal commitments, replacing them with vague statements about 'general principles of law,' 'may consider waiving certain rights,' and 'mutually agreed upon' location. This creates significant uncertainty regarding which laws govern the agreement, whether a jury trial is possible, and where disputes can be resolved. It contradicts established legal procedures and the enforceability of the contract under Nevada law.",

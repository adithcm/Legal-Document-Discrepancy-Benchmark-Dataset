                "original_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member’s fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the financial stability of the Society is questioned, you might be asked to contribute more funds. The administration will decide how much extra to charge. The amount will be sort of based on what seems like a fair amount. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within a reasonable timeframe from when we tell you, the amount will be added to what you owe with interest.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'solvency' with 'financial stability' and 'Board of Directors' with 'administration' introduces vagueness, as 'financial stability' and 'administration' are not precisely defined terms like 'solvency' and 'Board of Directors'. 'Reasonable timeframe' also creates uncertainty. This undermines the enforceability of the solvency maintenance clause, as it's unclear what triggers the extra payment or how it's determined.",

Rights and privileges of membership are set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Society. These rights and privileges are separate from the ownership of this contract.",

Rights and privileges of being a member are described somewhere in the Society's documents. These rights and privileges are not necessarily related to owning this contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text refers to 'Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws', which are specific legal documents. The modified text replaces this with 'somewhere in the Society's documents,' which is vague. This makes it difficult to determine the exact rights and privileges of membership, creating ambiguity and potentially contradicting the intended legal effect of membership as defined in the Society's governing documents.",

                "explanation": "Replacing the legally defined term 'divisible surplus' with the vague phrase 'extra money' and replacing the definitive 'each year, we will determine' with the uncertain 'every so often, we may decide' introduces ambiguity. This makes the dividend provision unenforceable, as it's unclear when or how dividends will be determined, contradicting the standard understanding of dividend distribution in insurance contracts.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "“Property” as stated herein shall mean Theismann’s name (including “Joe Theismann”, “Theismann” “J. Theismann”), nicknames, initials, autograph, facsimile signature, photograph, image, likeness, voice, video portrayals, biographical data, character, symbols, and/or other endorsement, and any variations or deviations thereof.",
                "changed_text": "“Property” as stated herein shall mean Theismann’s general reputation, including but not limited to his positive image and public perception, and any variations or deviations thereof.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Property' is specific and includes tangible and identifiable items. The modified definition broadens it to 'general reputation,' which is vague and subjective. This creates a legal contradiction because 'general reputation' lacks a precise legal definition, unlike the items listed in the original definition. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as it's unclear how 'general reputation' can be definitively used in advertising or promotional materials, potentially conflicting with right of publicity laws.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may change its address for the purpose of this Agreement without formal notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates formal notice for address changes. The modified version removes this requirement. This conflicts with standard contract law principles which require proper notification for key changes to be legally binding and could void certain requirements of the contract that depends on addresses being up to date such as royalty or legal notifications.",

                "original_text": "Theismann's performance of services for Bizzingo hereunder is in his or her capacity as an independent contractor. Accordingly, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as establishing an employer/employee, a partnership, or a joint venture relationship between Theismann and Bizzingo.",
                "changed_text": "Theismann's performance of services for Bizzingo hereunder is in his or her capacity as an independent contractor. Bizzingo, however, shall retain full control over the manner and means by which Theismann performs these services.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly defines Theismann as an 'independent contractor,' which under US law implies Theismann controls how the services are performed. The added sentence stating 'Bizzingo, however, shall retain full control over the manner and means by which Theismann performs these services' directly contradicts this definition. This suggests an employer-employee relationship, despite the stated intention, potentially violating labor laws and creating liability for Bizzingo.",

Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any\nindividual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under\ncommon control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\nthe direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of a party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such\nparty.",

Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any\nindividual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under\ncommon control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\nthe direct or indirect influence over the business decisions of a party, regardless of ownership percentage.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies a clear ownership threshold (50%) for 'control,' aligning with standard corporate law. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by removing the specific ownership percentage and replacing it with 'direct or indirect influence,' which is vague and subjective. This contradicts the standard legal definition of 'control' and could lead to disputes over who qualifies as an affiliate.",

                "explanation": "The original clause excludes information that becomes publicly available 'through no fault of the receiving party.' This aligns with typical confidentiality agreements that protect against inadvertent disclosures. The modified clause removes this 'no fault' provision, meaning that ANY information that becomes publicly available, even due to the receiving party's negligence or intentional act, is no longer considered confidential. This contradicts established legal principles of confidentiality, where the receiving party has a duty to protect confidential information, and significantly weakens the confidentiality protection, rendering it less enforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that the parties are independent contractors with no authority to bind each other. The modified clause introduces an exception where VerticalNet has authority to approve PaperExchange's marketing materials. This undermines the 'independent contractor' designation, as it grants VerticalNet a degree of control over PaperExchange's operations, blurring the lines and potentially creating an agency relationship under the law, even if unintentional. This weakens the original intent and can cause legal challenges.",

                "changed_text": "4) Compensation\n\nWhen custom Products are designed, developed and to be delivered to Bravatek-identified perspective clients, the parties may negotiate a sales price orally or in writing for use during the project at any point during the project.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by altering the method and timing of agreeing on a sales price. The original clause specifies a 'proposed sales price' agreed to 'in writing' 'prior to the commencement of each project,' providing a clear and enforceable term. The modified clause replaces 'shall agree' with 'may negotiate,' making the agreement optional, removes the 'in writing' requirement, allowing oral agreements, and changes the timing to 'any point during the project.' This contradicts basic contract law principles in Texas, which generally requires clarity and agreement on essential terms like price before performance begins to ensure enforceability. Allowing oral agreements and deferring price agreement until 'any point' introduces ambiguity and potential disputes, rendering the compensation terms vague and unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "5) Confidentiality\n\n\"Confidential information\" shall mean any and all technical and non-technical information, documents and materials related to client projects of party and products, services and business of each of the parties. COMPANY and Bravatek agree to maintain in strict confidence and not to disclose or disseminate, or to use for any purposes other than performance of the projects, the Confidential Information disclosed.",
                "changed_text": "5) Confidentiality\n\n\"Proprietary information\" refers to only documents clearly marked as confidential at the time of disclosure. COMPANY and Bravatek agree to, to the best of their ability, keep such Proprietary Information confidential.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces the well-defined term 'Confidential Information' with the narrower and less precise term 'Proprietary Information,' and adds a requirement that documents be 'clearly marked as confidential at the time of disclosure'. It also weakens the obligation to maintain confidentiality from 'maintain in strict confidence and not to disclose' to 'to the best of their ability, keep such Proprietary Information confidential.' This undermines the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information. Under Texas law, trade secrets and other confidential information can be protected even if not explicitly marked confidential, provided there is a reasonable expectation of confidentiality and the information provides a competitive advantage. By limiting the scope of protected information to only marked documents and weakening the duty of confidentiality, the clause conflicts with Texas trade secret law.",

                "original_text": "10) Indemnification\n\nCOMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of COMPANY or breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement.\n\nBravatek shall indemnify COMPANY, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of Bravatek or breach of Bravatek of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "10) Indemnification\n\nCOMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek only for direct damages, excluding all consequential and incidental damages, attorney's fees, and court costs, arising solely from COMPANY's gross negligence. Bravatek shall indemnify COMPANY under the same conditions.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly narrows the scope of indemnification, creating a legal contradiction. The original clause provides broad indemnification for 'any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs' arising from negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of contract. The modified clause limits indemnification to 'direct damages,' excludes 'consequential and incidental damages, attorney's fees, and court costs,' and requires 'gross negligence' instead of simple negligence or breach of contract. Under Texas law, indemnification clauses are generally interpreted broadly to cover a wide range of damages unless specifically limited. Excluding attorney's fees and limiting the trigger to gross negligence severely restricts the protection provided by the original clause, potentially conflicting with the parties' reasonable expectations and diminishing the value of the indemnification provision. It moves away from the reasonable standard of general liability, potentially making it unenforceable under common law.",

                "original_text": "1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Todos hereby grants the Reseller a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, exclusive right to distribute and sell the Products to Customers in the TerritoryÍ¾ provided, however, that Reseller may sub-license or transfer its distribution rights to a subsidiary or affiliate of the Reseller.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Todos hereby grants the Reseller a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, exclusive right to distribute and sell the Products to Customers in the Territory; Reseller may not sub-license or transfer its distribution rights to a subsidiary or affiliate of the Reseller.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows the Reseller to sub-license or transfer its distribution rights to a subsidiary or affiliate, contradicting the initial grant of a 'non-sublicensable, non-transferable' right. This creates ambiguity regarding the extent and transferability of the granted rights under Israeli contract law, leading to potential disputes about who can legally distribute the products.",
                "contradicted_law": "Israeli Contract Law (General Part) 5733-1973, specifically regarding the interpretation of contract terms and assignment of rights.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "4.3 Except for AMAR approval which is the responsibility of Todos, the Reseller shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary governmental, regulatory, and other permits and licenses required to distribute and sell the Products in Israel. Todos shall provide the Reseller with all required assistance in this matter in order to obtain the necessary licenses and permits.",
                "changed_text": "4.3 The Reseller shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary governmental, regulatory, and other permits and licenses required to distribute and sell the Products in Israel, including AMAR approval. Todos is not required to provide the Reseller with all required assistance in this matter in order to obtain the necessary licenses and permits.",
                "explanation": "This alteration places the responsibility for obtaining AMAR approval, which is the most critical regulatory approval for distributing medical products in Israel, onto the Reseller, directly contradicting the original statement that Todos is responsible. It also removes Todos' obligation to provide assistance. This introduces legal ambiguity and contradiction regarding regulatory compliance duties, potentially rendering the agreement unenforceable regarding distribution rights, as it violates accepted regulatory responsibilities under Israeli law for medical product distribution.",
                "contradicted_law": "Israeli Public Health Regulations (Pharmaceuticals) and administrative law principles regarding regulatory responsibilities.",

                "original_text": "5.7 Payment for Products. Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than thirty (30) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",
                "changed_text": "5.7 Payment for Products. Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums at their discretion. All payments made to Todos shall be in US dollars.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces a fixed payment deadline with discretionary payment, undermining the enforceability of payment terms. Additionally, mandating payment in US dollars, but governing the agreement under Israeli law creates a conflict as to which currency the contract is based upon. This contradicts fundamental principles of contractual certainty and enforceability under Israeli Contract Law and creates ambiguity as to the terms of payment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Israeli Contract Law (General Part) 5733-1973 concerning the requirement for certainty of terms, particularly payment terms.",

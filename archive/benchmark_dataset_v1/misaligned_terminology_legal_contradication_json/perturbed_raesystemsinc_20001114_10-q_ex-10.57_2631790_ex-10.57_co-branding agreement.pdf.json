                "original_text": "1.4     \"Intellectual  Property  Rights\"  means  all  current  and  future worldwide trademark, patents and patent rights, utility models, copyrights, mask work  rights,  trade secrets, and all other intellectual property rights and the related  documentation  or  other  tangible  expression  thereof.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"all other intellectual property rights\" to \"certain other intellectual property rights,\" the definition becomes ambiguous and contradicts the generally accepted legal understanding that 'all' encompasses everything within the category. This creates uncertainty as to which intellectual property rights are actually covered by the agreement, potentially leading to disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States Intellectual Property Law - Broadly defines and protects intellectual property rights including those not explicitly listed, while this contract change limits that scope without specifying which rights are excluded.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"OR STATUTORY\" from the warranty disclaimer, the contract attempts to bypass legally mandated warranties. While parties can disclaim implied and express warranties to the extent permitted by law, statutory warranties are often non-waivable. This attempted disclaimer is a legal contradiction as it conflicts with consumer protection and commercial laws that may impose statutory warranties regardless of contractual language.",

Neither  NETTAXI  or  SpinRecords.com shall assign its respective  rights  or delegate its obligations hereunder, either in whole or in part,  whether  by  operation  of  law  or  otherwise, without the prior written consent  of  the other party.

Any attempted assignment or delegation without the other  party's  written  consent  will  be  void.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"operation of law\" with \"direct contract,\" the clause now suggests that assignments or delegations occurring due to legal events like mergers, acquisitions, or court orders are permissible without consent. This directly contradicts established legal principles where 'operation of law' triggers automatic transfers of rights and obligations, often requiring specific consent or notification depending on the jurisdiction and type of assignment. The change creates ambiguity and could render the assignment clause unenforceable in certain situations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Generally recognizes assignments by operation of law (e.g., in cases of bankruptcy or merger) without requiring consent unless explicitly stated otherwise; this modification attempts to override that legal principle.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'BOF', the definition of 'Facility' becomes less inclusive. This creates ambiguity because other sections of the contract refer to Facility Services which are explicitly defined to include services to both the Bloom Systems *and* the BOF. This contradicts the original intention and introduces uncertainty about the scope of services covered.",

                "explanation": "This removes the explicit obligation to service the 'BOF' under the Facility Services Warranty, directly contradicting the earlier references to BOF services and potentially leading to disputes about the operator's responsibilities.

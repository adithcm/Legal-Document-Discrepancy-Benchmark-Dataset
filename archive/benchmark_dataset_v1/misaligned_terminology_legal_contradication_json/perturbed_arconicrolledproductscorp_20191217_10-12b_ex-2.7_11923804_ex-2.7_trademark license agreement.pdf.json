Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right at all times to control and approve the nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon), and to inspect Licensee’s business operations upon reasonable prior notice for the purpose of ensuring that a high level of quality of the Licensed Products is being maintained by Licensee.",

Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right periodically to suggest, but not control or approve, the nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon), and will advise Licensee’s business operations without prior notice or restrictions.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Licensor explicit control over the quality of the Licensed Products. The modified text removes this control and gives it the much weaker power of suggestion. The original text is in line with maintaining trademark protection, while the modified text weakens that protection.",

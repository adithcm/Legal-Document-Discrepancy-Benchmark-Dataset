Confidential Information does not include any data or information which the receiving party can demonstrate with competent\nwritten proof:  (i) was already known to it at the time of disclosure;  (ii) was independently developed by it without reference to the disclosing party’s\nConfidential Information;  (iii) is in the public domain;  (iv) was rightfully disclosed to it by a third party without obligation of confidentiality; or (v) is\nrequired to be disclosed pursuant to any statutory or regulatory authority or court order, provided the disclosing party is given prompt written\nnotice of such requirement and the scope of such disclosure is limited to the extent possible.\n(b) Trade Secrets. “Trade Secrets” shall mean Confidential Information, including but not limited to technical or non-technical data, a formula, a\npattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of\nactual or potential customers or suppliers, in any form or format, which is not commonly known by or available to the public and which:  (i) derives\neconomic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who\ncan obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its\nsecrecy.",

                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Confidential Information' removes the requirement for marking or identification, and eliminates the exclusions for previously known, independently developed, or public information. The trade secret definition is perturbed to the opposite of the original. This directly contradicts established trade secret and confidentiality laws, where reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy and proper identification are crucial. The changes create a situation where almost all information could be deemed confidential, leading to enforcement challenges and conflicting legal interpretations. This creates a misalignment and legal contradiction that could render the clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'lower' to 'higher' and significantly increasing the interest rate to 20% while referencing the 'minimum legal rate,' the contract now potentially violates usury laws, which set maximum interest rates that can be legally charged on a debt. In New York, where the contract is governed, charging an interest rate significantly above the legal limit could be considered criminal usury. Further, referring to a 'minimum legal rate' introduces ambiguity, as usury laws focus on maximums. This creates uncertainty and potential legal challenges to the enforceability of the late payment clause.",

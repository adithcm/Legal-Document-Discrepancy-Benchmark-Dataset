                "original_text": "Term. This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the “Sales Term” as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the “Term”).",
                "changed_text": "Term. This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the \"business needs\" dictate its termination, as determined solely by Vivint Solar, Inc. (the “Term”).",
                "explanation": "The original 'Term' is explicitly linked to the 'Sales Term' defined in another agreement, providing a clear endpoint. The modified version replaces this with the ambiguous 'business needs' and gives Vivint Solar unilateral power to decide when to terminate the agreement. This introduces subjectivity and contradicts standard contract law principles requiring mutual agreement on key terms like duration, making enforcement uncertain. 'Business needs' is not a legally defined term and can be interpreted broadly, potentially undermining the purpose of the non-competition agreement.",

Section 2 of the Non-Competition Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and the other provisions of the Non-Competition Agreement that relate to such Section 2, including, without limitation, Sections 5 and 6, shall be amended hereby to delete the applicable references, and provisions solely applicable to, Section 2, mutatis mutandis.",
                "changed_text": "Non-Competition. Section 2 of the Non-Competition Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and the other provisions of the Non-Competition Agreement that relate to such Section 2, including, without limitation, Sections 5 and 6, shall be interpreted based on what is 'fair and reasonable' under the circumstances, as determined by the prevailing party in any dispute, mutatis mutandis.",
                "explanation": "The original text deletes Section 2, and other sections are amended. The changed text states they will be interpreted based on what is 'fair and reasonable' as determined by the prevailing party. This contradicts the principle of objective interpretation in contract law. 'Fair and reasonable' is subjective, but assigning its determination to the 'prevailing party' makes it arbitrary and self-serving, rendering the non-competition clause vulnerable to challenge.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to a 'Non-Competition Agreement' to set out restrictive covenants. The modified version renames this the “Gentleman’s Agreement” and describes it as a 'non-binding expression of intent'. This directly contradicts the standard legal understanding of a non-competition agreement, which imposes legally enforceable restrictions. A 'Gentleman's Agreement' has no legal standing. This undermines the enforceability of the entire agreement.",

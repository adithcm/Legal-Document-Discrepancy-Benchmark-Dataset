                "original_text": "1. Definitions. A Confidential Information@ shall mean any and all information that a Party may reasonably expect to remain confidential and not shared with the general public at any time or that information that is protected by law.",
                "changed_text": "1. Definitions. Confidential Information shall mean only such information explicitly marked as 'Confidential' by the disclosing party. Information protected by law may or may not be considered Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "The original definition broadly covers information reasonably expected to be confidential and information protected by law. The modified definition narrows it to only explicitly marked information, potentially excluding information legally protected but not explicitly marked, thus contradicting common understandings of trade secrets and other legally protected confidential data.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but generally contradicts trade secret laws and other regulations protecting confidential information that might not be explicitly labeled as such.",

It is expressly understood and agreed that (i) in the performance of Services under this Agreement, the Business Affiliate shall at all times act as an independent contractor with respect to UDC and not as an employee or agent of UDC and (ii) nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a joint venture, partnership, association or other affiliation, or like relationship, between the Parties, it being specifically agreed that the relationship is and shall remain that of independent Parties to a contractual relationship. Accordingly, UDC shall neither have nor exercise any specific control or direction over the particular methods by which Business Affiliate performs services required by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "e. Relationship of the Parties. It is expressly understood and agreed that (i) in the performance of Services under this Agreement, the Business Affiliate shall at all times act as an independent contractor with respect to UDC and not as an employee or agent of UDC and (ii) nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a joint venture, partnership, association or other affiliation, or like relationship, between the Parties, it being specifically agreed that the relationship is and shall remain that of independent Parties to a contractual relationship. UDC shall maintain the right to oversee and direct the specific methods by which Business Affiliate performs services required by this Agreement to ensure compliance with UDC standards.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that UDC will not exercise specific control over the methods used by the Business Affiliate, reinforcing an independent contractor relationship. The modified text introduces UDC's right to oversee and direct those methods. This level of control can legally reclassify the Business Affiliate as an employee rather than an independent contractor under employment laws.",

In no event shall either Party be liable for the debts or obligations of the other, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement. Neither Party shall have any claim under this Agreement or otherwise against the other Party for vacation pay, paid sick leave, retirement benefits, social security, worker=s compensation, health, disability, professional malpractice or unemployment insurance benefits, or other employee benefits of any kind.",
                "changed_text": "Accordingly, UDC shall neither have nor exercise any specific control or direction over the particular methods by which Business Affiliate performs services required by this Agreement. UDC may, at its discretion, offer certain benefits, such as health insurance, to Business Affiliate based on performance metrics. Neither Party shall have any claim under this Agreement or otherwise against the other Party for vacation pay, paid sick leave, retirement benefits, social security, worker=s compensation, disability, professional malpractice or unemployment insurance benefits.",
                "explanation": "While maintaining the 'independent contractor' facade by stating no claims for typical benefits, the modification introduces the possibility of UDC offering health insurance 'at its discretion based on performance'. Offering benefits typically associated with employment further blurs the line between independent contractor and employee, potentially leading to misclassification and liability for employment taxes and benefits.",

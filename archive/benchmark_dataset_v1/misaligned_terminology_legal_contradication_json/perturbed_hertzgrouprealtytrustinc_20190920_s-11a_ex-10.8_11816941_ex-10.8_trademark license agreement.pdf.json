                "original_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the suggestion, directly or indirectly, of the power to influence the management or policies of a person or entity, whether through friendly advice or occasional recommendations.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Control' aligns with the standard legal interpretation regarding the ability to direct management or policies. The modified definition weakens this significantly, reducing 'Control' to mere 'suggestion' and 'influence'. This contradicts the legal understanding of control, which implies a binding authority, especially in corporate law.",

                "changed_text": "2.1 Licensor hereby grants Licensed Users a license, during the term of this Agreement, to use and display the Licensed Trade Name and the Licensed Mark in the United States solely in connection with the Licensee's corporate name and identifying mark.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, royalty-free' from the definition the LICENSE GRANT AND CONDITIONS OF LICENSED USE, the modified text opens ambiguity, suggesting potentially exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, and royalty-bearing rights. This contradicts established trademark licensing practices, where the default is non-exclusivity unless explicitly stated otherwise. It creates uncertainty around the scope of rights granted, leading to potential disputes.",

Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' own expense, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, expense or liability (including attorneys' fees and costs), to the extent that the foregoing (a) is based on a claim resulting solely from any service provided or offered by Licensed Users, (b) results from a material breach, or is based on a claim that, if true, would be a material breach, of this Agreement by Licensed Users, or (c) is based upon Licensed Users' unauthorized or improper use of the Licensed Mark.",

Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' discretion, may indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, expense or liability (including attorneys' fees and costs), to the extent they feel it's appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates indemnification by the Licensed Users under specific conditions. The modification makes indemnification discretionary ('Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' discretion, may indemnify'). This contradicts the standard legal understanding of indemnification, which typically involves a contractual obligation to protect against losses or damages. Making it discretionary undermines the purpose of the indemnification clause, creating uncertainty about liability and risk allocation.",

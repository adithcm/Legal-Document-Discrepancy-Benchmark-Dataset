                "explanation": "The original definition included affiliates of the Distributor who utilize the Product, broadening the scope of 'Customer.' The modified definition restricts 'Customer' to only those directly purchasing, potentially excluding end-users who are affiliates. This creates ambiguity as to whether sales to affiliates count toward performance benchmarks or revenue sharing, conflicting with standard business interpretations of 'customer' which often include end-users.",

Customer Locations should be available for installation within a reasonable time of approval by Hydraspin. All Customer Locations in excess of\n2",
                "explanation": "The original text sets firm requirements with specific numbers. The modified text changes 'shall mean the following requirements' to 'shall mean requirements which Distributor must attempt to meet', introduces subjective terms ('try,' 'should,' 'reasonable time') and removes the specific quantifiable benchmarks (25 locations, 7,500 barrels, 90 days). This weakens the obligations and creates ambiguity, making enforcement uncertain, and contradicting typical contract law requirements for clarity.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates notification of claims and guarantees repair/replacement of defective products. The modified version replaces 'shall provide' with 'may provide,' 'will also keep' with 'might keep,' and 'will repair or replace' with 'will consider repair or replacement.'

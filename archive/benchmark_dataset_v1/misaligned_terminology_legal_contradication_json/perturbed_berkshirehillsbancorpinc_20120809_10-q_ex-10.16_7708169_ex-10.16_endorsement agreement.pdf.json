                "original_text": "h) “BERKSHIRE PARTIES” is Berkshire, and any affiliates of Berkshire, as defined herein. For purposes of this Agreement, “AFFILIATES” means any other person or entity that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, Berkshire.",
                "changed_text": "h) “BERKSHIRE PARTIES” is Berkshire, and any affiliates of Berkshire, as defined herein. For purposes of this Agreement, “AFFILIATES” means any entity Berkshire deems to be strategically aligned.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliates\" adheres to the standard legal definition of control. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by allowing Berkshire to unilaterally decide what constitutes an affiliate. This contradicts the standard legal definition and creates uncertainty, potentially impacting obligations and liabilities tied to affiliates under the contract and relevant banking regulations.",

Except as required by federal securities laws, or federal or state banking laws, each party agrees: (i) that it will not disclose to any third party or use any Confidential Information, as defined herein, disclosed to it by the other party except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; and (ii) that it will take all reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control, which will in no event be less than the measures it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own information of similar importance. For the purpose of this Agreement, Confidential Information shall mean all information, materials and data, in any form, format or medium, disclosed, or revealed to either party in any way relating to the other party’s business including but not limited to its finances, customers, operations, products, services, plans, pricing, suppliers, business strategies or any other similar information. Confidential Information may be contained in written material, verbal or electronic communications.",
                "changed_text": "9. CONFIDENTIALITY. Except as required by law, or for business convenience, each party agrees: (i) that it will not disclose to any third party or use any Confidential Information, as loosely interpreted herein, disclosed to it by the other party except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; and (ii) that it will take measures it considers adequate to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control. For the purpose of this Agreement, Confidential Information shall mean information the disclosing party explicitly marks as \"Confidential.\"",
                "explanation": "The original clause protects a broad range of business information. The modified clause severely limits the scope of \"Confidential Information\" to only information explicitly marked as such, and allows disclosure for \"business convenience\". This contradicts standard legal interpretations of confidentiality, which protect competitively sensitive information regardless of explicit labeling, and banking regulations which may require stricter protection of customer data.",

FORCE MAJEUR.\n\nNotwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, neither Party will be liable for any delay in the performance of any of its obligations if such delay is caused by any reason wholly outside the control of the Party so delaying (a “Force Majeur Event”) subject to the obligation of the Party so delaying promptly notifying the other Party in writing of the reasons for the delay and the likely duration of the delay. The performance of such Party’s obligations will be suspended during the period that the Force Majeur Event persists and such Party will be granted an extension of time for performance equal to the period of the delay. If the delay referred to above exceeds sixty (60) days (or such other reasonable period taking into consideration the nature and cause of the delay), either Party may forthwith terminate this Agreement whereupon the Parties shall cease to be bound by their respective obligations under this Agreement in respect granted under this Agreement shall cease.",
                "changed_text": "15. FORCE MAJEUR.\n\nNotwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, neither Party will be liable for any delay in the performance of any of its obligations if such delay is claimed to be caused by any reason outside the control of the Party so delaying (a “Force Majeur Event”). The performance of such Party’s obligations will be suspended during the period that the Force Majeur Event is claimed and such Party will determine the necessary extension of time for performance. Either Party may terminate this Agreement after providing rationale.",
                "explanation": "The original Force Majeure clause requires the delaying party to notify the other party promptly in writing of the reasons for the delay and likely duration, providing some accountability. The modified clause removes the notification requirement and gives the delaying party sole discretion to determine the extension and removes the specification of a 'reasonable' period. This creates uncertainty and contradicts typical legal interpretations of Force Majeure, which require objective evidence of an event outside a party's control. It also removes a check and balance on potential abuse of the clause.",

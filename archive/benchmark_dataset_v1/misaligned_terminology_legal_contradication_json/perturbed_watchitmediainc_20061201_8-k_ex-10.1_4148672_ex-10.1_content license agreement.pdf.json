                "original_text": "Watchit shall have the exclusive right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content and will have the right to brand the content under the Watchit brand and place a “bug” on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark.",
                "changed_text": "Watchit shall have the right to sell third party advertising with Oceanic Time Warner Cable's permission and will have the right to brand the content under any branding.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Watchit an 'exclusive right'. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating Watchit can sell third-party advertising only with Oceanic Time Warner Cable's permission, negating the 'exclusive' aspect. Similarly, granting the rights for any brand to be displayed will remove the 'Watchit' trademark protection, creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly prohibits Oceanic Time Warner Cable from editing or modifying the content. The modified text directly contradicts this by allowing them to edit or modify the content as they see fit. This creates a clear conflict in the contract terms.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable may pay a fee.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly stipulates a cancellation fee of $5,000 per month. By changing 'agrees to pay' to 'may pay a fee,' the obligation becomes discretionary and directly contradicts the original binding agreement. This weakens the enforceability of the cancellation clause.",

                "changed_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to a single hardware chassis or card, or to that number of users as Customer deems necessary, notwithstanding the Purchase Order, provided Customer notifies Cisco of such usage.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the limits of software usage based on the Purchase Order. The modification introduces ambiguity by allowing the Customer to determine usage based on their 'needs,' overriding the agreed-upon limits specified in the Purchase Order. This contradicts contract law principles requiring adherence to agreed-upon terms and introduces uncertainty in enforcement.",

Customer shall not disclose, provide, or otherwise make available such trade secrets or copyrighted material in any form to any third party without the prior written consent of Cisco. Customer shall implement reasonable security measures to protect such trade secrets and copyrighted materials. Title to Software and Documentation shall remain solely with Cisco, its suppliers or licensors.",

Customer may disclose this information to third parties with a legitimate need to know, provided they are informed of its confidential nature. Title to Software and Documentation is transferred to the Customer upon full payment of the license fee.",
                "explanation": "The original text firmly establishes the Software and Documentation as trade secrets/copyrighted material belonging to Cisco and prohibits disclosure without consent. The modified text weakens this protection by allowing disclosure to third parties with a 'legitimate need to know' without defining this term and claiming title is transferred after payment. This contradicts intellectual property law principles and creates uncertainty about ownership and confidentiality obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original warranty specifies a clear timeframe and criteria for the warranty, including conformity to published specifications. The modified text provides a vague warranty of 'functioning as expected' and doesn't say how long that will be. This contradicts warranty law, which mandates clarity on duration and scope and replaces that clarity with a subjective expectation. This opens the door to interpretation, making the contract unenforceable, and removes conformity to published specifications.",

                "original_text": "1.3\n“Exploit” or “Exploitation” means to reproduce, distribute, digitally transmit, publish, publicly perform or otherwise display via\nany and all means of video or audio-visual media, or means of distribution except as set forth in this Agreement as to manner,\nfrequency or duration of use including, but not limited to: film, television, streaming, short-form streaming, social media, SVOD,\nIVOD, pay per view, OTT, theatrical professional/non-professional productions, location based entertainment, music, publishing,\nholographic mediums, projection mapping, haptic mediums, as well as any marketing, advertising, and promotional activities\nthereof in any medium currently existing or hereinafter created.",
                "changed_text": "1.3\n“Exploit” or “Exploitation” means to use PFHOF Works for internal purposes only. This includes storage, review, and analysis, but explicitly excludes distribution, publication, or display to external parties without explicit written consent from the Village Media Company.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Exploit' is broad, covering a wide range of uses. The modified definition severely restricts this, limiting it to internal use only. This introduces a legal contradiction because subsequent sections of the contract rely on the original, broader definition to define the rights and obligations of both parties. This change creates uncertainty about the scope of the license granted, as the Village Media Company's ability to 'Exploit' PFHOF Works is now drastically different from what the rest of the agreement implies. This also has to do with federal copyright law.",

The Village Media Company can sublicense exploitation to any third party.",
                "explanation": "The text explicitly states that the license is non-sublicenseable. Sub licensing involves giving a new license from an original license. Here, it has been modified so that Village Media Company CAN sublicense. This violates what the contract says originally. This alteration creates a direct contradiction within the contract regarding the sublicensing rights. This has to do with general contract law regarding agreement between two parties.",

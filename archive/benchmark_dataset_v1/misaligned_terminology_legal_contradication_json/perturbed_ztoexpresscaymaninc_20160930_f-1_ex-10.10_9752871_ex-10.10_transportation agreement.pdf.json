                "original_text": "(c) Clearance of freight: the clearance method is based on both Parties’ fund clearance arrangement and the final clearance amount is subject to actual carriage amount and EX-warehouse (“EXW”) weight determined by Party A. Party B shall attach Party A’s parcel EXW originals or copies for Party A’s verification for clearance of freight.",
                "changed_text": "(c) Clearance of freight: the clearance method will be unilaterally determined by Party A. The final clearance amount is subject to Party A's discretion, without requiring specific documentation or justification. Party B is expected to accept Party A’s clearance decisions without further recourse.",
                "explanation": "This change gives Party A unchecked authority over freight clearance, contradicting standard legal expectations of fair dealing and potentially violating regulations that require transparency and agreement in financial transactions.",

                "original_text": "(e) Party B shall arrive at the network partners determined by Party A according to the time and route stipulated in this Agreement, and strictly comply with the start time and end time. Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B’s vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB500 per trip on the first working day, RMB1,000 per trip on the second working day and RMB2,000 per trip on the third working day (based on the time records on the parcel transfer documents) and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month’s freight. In the special event of changes to route and time and severe weather (or other force majeure events), Party B shall be in touch with Party A in time and record such special event on the parcel transfer documents with Party A’s approval.",
                "changed_text": "(e) Party B shall attempt to arrive at the network partners. Any delays are subject to penalties determined at the sole discretion of Party A, regardless of the cause. Liquidated damages may be applied retroactively and without prior notice. Force majeure events do not exempt Party B from penalties unless explicitly waived by Party A in writing after the event.",
                "explanation": "This modification alters the concept of 'liquidated damages' to be punitive rather than compensatory and removes the possibility of force majeure as a legitimate excuse, deviating from generally accepted contract law principles regarding reasonable damages and excusable delays.",

                "explanation": "This clause gives Party A absolute and unchecked power over the interpretation of the contract, including the ability to contradict the plain language of the agreement or even relevant laws. This is inconsistent with legal standards requiring fairness and due process in contract interpretation and enforcement.",

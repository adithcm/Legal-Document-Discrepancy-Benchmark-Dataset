                "original_text": "“Gross Sales” shall mean total revenues, under generally accepted accounting principles, from sales of the Licensed Products, but does not include any revenue from sales, use or other transaction taxes, duties, handling, graphics, embroidery or shipping.",
                "changed_text": "“Gross Sales” shall mean total revenues from sales of the Licensed Products, excluding only direct costs associated with manufacturing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Gross Sales' aligns with standard accounting practices. The modified definition narrows the exclusions, potentially including revenues that are typically excluded under GAAP, such as sales taxes. This creates a legal contradiction because GAAP is often a benchmark in financial agreements. California law recognizes GAAP for financial reporting, making deviation a point of contention.",

Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period by written amendment to this Agreement. All amendments to this Agreement must be signed by all parties to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "“Licensed Products” initially includes BlackMP Living Water and may, at the Company's sole discretion, include other products bearing the Pro Football Legends Logo, irrespective of written amendments.",
                "explanation": "The original definition requires written amendments to add products. The modified version allows the Company to add products at its discretion without written agreement, contradicting the initial contract terms. This creates uncertainty and potential breach of contract issues under California contract law, which requires mutual consent for modifications.",

Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the NFLA-NC beginning on the first full quarter (three month period) of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.\n\nPast due payments under this Agreement shall bear interest at the rate of: (a) 1% per month; or (b) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less.

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a clear payment schedule and a fixed rate per unit. The modified text introduces ambiguity by making payments subject to the 'Company's convenience' and allowing the 'Company's estimation of market value' to dictate the unit price. It also makes interest on late payments discretionary. This directly contradicts the original terms and California contract law, which requires definite terms and consideration.",

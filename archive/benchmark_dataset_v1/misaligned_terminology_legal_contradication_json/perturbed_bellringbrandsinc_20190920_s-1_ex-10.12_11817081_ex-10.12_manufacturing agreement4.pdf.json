                "original_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective as of July 3, 2019 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”). Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.”",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (“Heritage”) Premier Nutrition Corporation (“Premier”) is effective as of July 3, 2019 (“Third Amendment Effective Date”) and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (“Agreement”). Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a “Contractor” and collectively as the “Contractors.”",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Party' to 'Contractor' introduces potential confusion. While 'Party' clearly indicates signatories to the agreement, 'Contractor' suggests an independent entity providing services. This is problematic if the entities are intended to be treated as equal parties to a mutual agreement rather than one acting as a service provider to the other. The legal implications for liability and obligations are significantly different.",

                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Heritage and Premier entered into a gentlemen's agreement",
                "explanation": "Changing the legal terminology to 'gentleman's agreement' turns the actual agreement that both parties are bounded to into a non binding agreement. This introduces legal uncertainty because the original binding agreement is now being implied to be non-binding.",

                "explanation": "Replacing the term's terms, conditions and covenants which have strict legal definitions with 'aspirations, suggestions, and communal understandings' weakens the contract, rendering it uncertain when it comes to enforceability. This weakens the terms of the contract, because the term is considered to be a non binding suggestion",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor will at all times be and represent itself to be an independent distributor, not an agent or employee of Erchonia.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will at all times be and represent itself to be an independent distributor, and also an agent of Erchonia.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. The original clause clearly states the distributor is *not* an agent. The modified clause states the distributor *is* an agent. Under common law, agency creates fiduciary duties and potential liability for the principal (Erchonia). This contradiction introduces ambiguity regarding the distributor's legal status and their authority to bind Erchonia.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All trademarks, including service marks, trade names and trade address that Erchonia uses in connection with the license granted hereunder (the “Trademarks”) are and remain the exclusive property of Erchonia. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to give Distributor any right, title or interest in any Trademark.",
                "changed_text": "All trademarks, including service marks, trade names and trade address that Erchonia uses in connection with the license granted hereunder (the “Trademarks”) are and remain the shared property of Erchonia and Distributor. This Agreement grants Distributor full right, title and interest in the Trademark upon the first sale of the product.",
                "explanation": "This directly contradicts trademark law, which protects exclusive ownership. Granting 'full right, title, and interest' to the distributor after a single sale clashes with the concept of trademark ownership and could result in trademark dilution or genericide if the distributor mismanages the brand. The original grants a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, while the modified grants full ownership after a single sale.",

Erchonia hereby affirms ALL other REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.",
                "explanation": "This change makes Erchonia affirm all possible warranties, express and implied, which goes against the original intention and usual commercial practice where warranties are limited to specific terms. A verbal warranty is also added, but there is no description of the warranty being described and is unenforceable.",

      "Quantum computers are still in early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize many fields, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug discovery:** Simulating molecules to create new medicines.\n",
      "*   **Materials science:** Designing new materials with specific properties.\n",
      "*   **Financial modeling:** Improving risk management and fraud detection.\n",

      "*   **Artificial intelligence:** Training more powerful AI models.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    prompt_ambiguity_inText = f\"\"\"You are a contract analyst ensuring consistency in legal agreements. Your task is to modify a document by introducing conflicting definitions of the same term within different sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Ambiguities also occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "    4. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Examples of Conflicting Definitions of a Term:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"The term \u2018Client\u2019 refers to any party who purchases our services.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Clients are defined as parties who hold an active contract for at least six months.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The first definition includes all buyers, while the second restricts \"Clients\" to long-term customers, leading to disputes over **contractual obligations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 1:** \"Employees are eligible for health benefits upon hiring.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 6:** \"Employees are eligible for health benefits after 90 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contradiction makes it unclear when benefits apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"The vendor is responsible for product warranties.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Warranty claims shall be processed by the manufacturer.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It\u2019s unclear **who holds warranty responsibility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Data shall be stored for five years.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Data must be deleted within two years.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** A **conflicting data retention period** could violate regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"A shareholder is anyone holding 5% or more equity.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 7:** \"A shareholder is anyone with voting rights.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** A shareholder under one section may **not qualify in another**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The Supplier shall deliver all goods in accordance with the specifications outlined in Schedule A. Any failure to meet these specifications will be considered a material breach of contract. In such cases, the Buyer reserves the right to request a full refund or demand replacement goods within 30 days. The Supplier guarantees that all goods will conform to the quality and performance standards described in the agreement.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The Supplier shall make every effort to deliver goods in accordance with the specifications outlined in Schedule A. If specifications are not fully met, the Buyer and Supplier will engage in discussions to determine an appropriate resolution, which may include partial refunds or adjusted delivery timelines.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall deliver' with 'shall make every effort,' making performance non-binding. The original contract clearly stated that failure to meet specifications was a material breach with predefined consequences, whereas the modified version introduces an uncertain resolution process. This creates an **internal contradiction** if another part of the contract enforces strict adherence to Schedule A\u2019s specifications.\n",

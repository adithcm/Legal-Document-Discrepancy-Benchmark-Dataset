      "*   Quantum computers use *qubits* (quantum bits).  Qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or *both at the same time* (called superposition).  Think of it as a coin spinning in the air. It's not heads or tails until it lands.\n",

      "*   **Entanglement:** Imagine two of our coins that are linked.  If one lands on heads, the other *instantly* lands on tails, even if they're far apart.  Entanglement allows qubits to be linked together, enabling complex calculations.\n",

      "*   **Materials science:** Designing new materials with specific properties.\n",

      "*   **Optimization:**  Solving complex problems like optimizing airline routes or financial portfolios.\n",
      "*   **AI/Machine Learning:** Developing new and more powerful AI algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Quantum computers are not replacing classical computers.**  They are good at *specific* types of problems. You'll still need your regular computer for everyday tasks like browsing the web.\n",
      "*   **Quantum computing is still in its early stages.** It's like the early days of classical computing, when computers were huge and expensive. It's very difficult to build and maintain quantum computers because they're incredibly sensitive to their environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"You are a contract structure analyst ensuring that contract clauses are placed logically. Your task is to reposition a clause in a way that contradicts another section of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Structural flaws also cause **in-text contradictions** when a clause is placed in **multiple locations with conflicting implications**. When contract sections contradict each other based on placement, it creates uncertainty about the obligations and rights of each party.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them.\n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    6. Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Clause Placement Creating Internal Conflict:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"The contract auto-renews unless the customer cancels 30 days before the renewal date.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Renewal is subject to mutual agreement by both parties.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** One section implies **automatic renewal**, while another requires **explicit agreement**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"The security deposit is refundable upon lease termination.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 11:** \"The security deposit is non-refundable.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It is unclear **whether tenants receive a refund**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"Confidentiality agreements last for five years.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 15:** \"Confidentiality agreements remain in effect indefinitely.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Creates **uncertainty about confidentiality duration**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 6:** \"Invoices must be paid within 30 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Late fees apply if invoices are unpaid after 45 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Contradicts the **payment deadline**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 5:** \"Employees must give 60 days' notice before resignation.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 14:** \"Employees may resign at any time.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Conflicting resignation terms **could cause legal disputes**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The company shall provide employees with a severance package equal to three months' salary in the event of involuntary termination, except in cases of gross misconduct. Severance payments will be issued in full within 30 days following the employee’s last working day. Employees who voluntarily resign are not eligible for severance benefits.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Employees who are terminated may receive a severance package at the company's discretion. Employees who voluntarily resign will have their eligibility determined on a case-by-case basis. Any severance payments, if applicable, will be provided in accordance with company policies.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The original text clearly stated that **involuntarily terminated employees must receive severance**, while **those who resign are not eligible**. The modified version **removes the certainty** by introducing **\"at the company’s discretion\"**, making it unclear when severance applies. Additionally, allowing severance for resigning employees on a \"case-by-case basis\" contradicts the prior statement that **resignation does not qualify for severance**. This internal contradiction could lead to disputes over severance entitlements.\n",

OFFICE SPACE 2.1 During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge. 2.2 LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and not needed by LKPL for its own purposes. Axiometric will have access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections, conference room, and printers. 2.3 If LKPL requires space used by Axiometric for LKPL's own purposes, then LKPL will attempt in good faith but without having any obligation to continue to provide Axiometric with comparable space. If LKPL deems itself unable to continue to provide Axiometric work space without expanding LKPL's facilities, and if LKPL determines it will be in its own best interests to expand its facilities, then LKPL will afford Axiometric the opportunity to lease space in the new facilities under a mutually acceptable separate commercial rental agreement. If Axiometric does not then wish to rent office space from LKPL, then LKPL may terminate Axiometric's license to use work space in LKPL's facility upon 60 days notice. 2.4 Axiometric shall be solely responsible for providing all equipment, furniture, supplies and other personal property that Axiometric deems appropriate to operate its business. LKPL will have no obligation to provide any special facilities or infrastructure unless otherwise negotiated. 2.5 LKPL will have no liability whatsoever for any of Axiometric's equipment, furniture, supplies or other personal property; Axiometric will use the space at its sole risk. 2.6 Axiometric will have the right to terminate the license to use the office space and to move out of the office space at any time upon two weeks notice.\n",

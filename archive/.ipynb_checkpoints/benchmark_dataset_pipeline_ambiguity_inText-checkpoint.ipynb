      "Okay, imagine regular computers like light switches. They can be either on (representing 1) or off (representing 0). They use these bits to perform calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers are like dimmer switches that can be both on and off *at the same time*, and everything in between!  This \"both at once\" state is called **superposition**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Regular Computer (Classical):**\n",
      "    *   Uses **bits**.\n",
      "    *   Each bit is either 0 or 1.\n",
      "    *   Like a light switch: ON or OFF.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Quantum Computer:**\n",
      "    *   Uses **qubits** (quantum bits).\n",
      "    *   A qubit can be 0, 1, or **both 0 and 1 simultaneously** (superposition).\n",
      "    *   Like a dimmer switch:  Can be off, on, or anywhere in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this \"both at once\" thing useful?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the computer can explore many possibilities *at the same time* using this superposition. Think of it like searching a maze. A regular computer would try one path at a time. A quantum computer could try ALL paths at once!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key concept is **entanglement**:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Entanglement:**  Imagine you have two of these special dimmer switches (qubits) that are linked.  If you flip one switch, you instantly know the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. They're linked in a special way. This is hard to visualize but is an important resource for quantum computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, what can quantum computers *do* that regular computers can't?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Solve certain problems much faster:** They excel at problems that involve exploring many possibilities at once, like:\n",
      "    *   **Drug discovery:** Simulating how molecules interact.\n",
      "    *   **Materials science:** Designing new materials.\n",
      "    *   **Cryptography:** Breaking and creating codes.\n",
      "    *   **Optimization problems:** Finding the best solution from many options (e.g., route planning).\n",
      "    *   **Financial modeling:** Better risk assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important things to remember:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Quantum computers are NOT meant to replace regular computers.  Your phone and laptop won't be quantum anytime soon.\n",
      "*   They are good for specific types of problems.  They wouldn't be better for writing an email or browsing the web.\n",
      "*   Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development.  They are very complex and expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers use qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 at the same time (superposition), allowing them to explore many possibilities simultaneously. Entanglement links qubits together. This makes them potentially much faster at solving certain types of problems than regular computers. They're a powerful, but still developing, technology.\n",

    "def generate_perturbation_new(original_text, file_name, prompt): \n",
    "    \"\"\"Generates a perturbed version of the legal document section in structured JSON format.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"You are a contract analyst ensuring consistency in legal agreements. Your task is to modify a document by introducing conflicting definitions of the same term within different sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Ambiguities also occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a **key term** in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify its definition in different sections so that they **conflict**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure the contradiction creates **uncertainty in enforcement**.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    6. Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Conflicting Definitions of a Term:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"The term ‘Client’ refers to any party who purchases our services.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 8:** \"Clients are defined as parties who hold an active contract for at least six months.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The first definition includes all buyers, while the second restricts \"Clients\" to long-term customers, leading to disputes over **contractual obligations**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Section 1:** \"Employees are eligible for health benefits upon hiring.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 6:** \"Employees are eligible for health benefits after 90 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The contradiction makes it unclear when benefits apply.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Section 4:** \"The vendor is responsible for product warranties.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 9:** \"Warranty claims shall be processed by the manufacturer.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** It’s unclear **who holds warranty responsibility**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Section 3:** \"Data shall be stored for five years.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 12:** \"Data must be deleted within two years.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** A **conflicting data retention period** could violate regulations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Section 2:** \"A shareholder is anyone holding 5% or more equity.\"\n",
    "    - **Section 7:** \"A shareholder is anyone with voting rights.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** A shareholder under one section may **not qualify in another**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The Supplier shall deliver all goods in accordance with the specifications outlined in Schedule A. Any failure to meet these specifications will be considered a material breach of contract. In such cases, the Buyer reserves the right to request a full refund or demand replacement goods within 30 days. The Supplier guarantees that all goods will conform to the quality and performance standards described in the agreement.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The Supplier shall make every effort to deliver goods in accordance with the specifications outlined in Schedule A. If specifications are not fully met, the Buyer and Supplier will engage in discussions to determine an appropriate resolution, which may include partial refunds or adjusted delivery timelines.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall deliver' with 'shall make every effort,' making performance non-binding. The original contract clearly stated that failure to meet specifications was a material breach with predefined consequences, whereas the modified version introduces an uncertain resolution process. This creates an **internal contradiction** if another part of the contract enforces strict adherence to Schedule A’s specifications.\n",

Confidential Information and Other Intellectual Property. a. The Parties anticipate exchanging Confidential Information (as defined in in the next Subsection) over the Term of this Agreement for the purpose of negotiating and entering into Purchase Schedules and amendments to this Agreement, transacting business with one in accordance with this Agreement and exercising their rights and performing their obligations under this Agreement (collectively referred to as the “Authorized Purpose”). b. The phrase “Confidential Information” means information meeting all of the following criteria: 1) The information is a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information owned by a Party or its direct and indirect subsidiaries under Applicable Law (this Party is referred to at times in this Section as the “Disclosing Party”); and 2) The other Party (referred to at times in this Section as the “Receiving Party”) requests such information from the Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose during the Term (i.e., neither Party wants unsolicited Confidential Information from the other Party”); and 3) The Disclosing Party discloses such requested information to the Receiving Party during the Term either labelled as “Confidential” or words of similar intent, or describes the disclosed information in reasonable detail in a written notice to the Receiving Party delivered, either at the time of disclosure or within five (5) days of disclosure. If a Disclosing Party neglects to label or deliver timely written notice to the Receiving Party identifying the disclosed information as confidential in nature, the disclosed information will only be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement if the Disclosing Party is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Receiving Party knew that the disclosed information was a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure.\n",

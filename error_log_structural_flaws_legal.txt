This Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any choice of law provision. 14.5.2 Dispute Resolution. Except with respect to those disputes in which a Party seeks equitable relief pursuant to Section 14.5.3 (Equitable Remedies) or for which a Party or Person is expressly given final decision-making authority as set forth in Section 3.5 (Decision-Making), the Parties, through their Senior Officers, will make a good faith effort to settle any disputes that may arise between them with respect to this Agreement. If the Parties do not settle the matter within [***] ([***]) days after the delivery by one Party of written notice (the "Arbitration Notice") to the other Party involved, then the Parties will submit the matter to binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware. All matters so submitted to arbitration will be settled by three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the [***], or its successor (the "[***] Rules"). In the event of a conflict between [***] Rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. Each Party will designate an arbitrator and the Parties will cause the designated arbitrators to mutually agree upon and to designate a third arbitrator who will serve as chairperson; provided, however, that failing such agreement within [***] ([***]) days of delivery of the Arbitration Notice, the third (3rd) arbitrator will be appointed in accordance with [***] Rules within an additional [***] ([***]) days. The Parties shall arrange for a hearing to occur and be completed within [***] ([***]) days after the appointment of the third (3rd) arbitrator, which hearing shall last no longer than [***], unless the arbitral panel believes a longer period is required, in which case the hearing may last [***]. The Parties will cause the arbitrators to decide the matter to be arbitrated within [***] ([***]) days after the close of evidence unless the chairperson arbitrator determines, at the request of any Party or on his or her own initiative, that such time period should be extended, in which case such time period may not be extended beyond an additional [***] ([***]) day period. Each of Ginkgo and BLI will be permitted to serve one set of document production requests with no more than [***] ([***]) requests; no more than [***] ([***]) interrogatories, including subparts, no more than [***] ([***]) requests for admissions; no more than [***] ([***]) subpoenas to Third Parties; and no more than [***] ([***]) notices of deposition per side, in each case, unless the arbitral panel directs otherwise. Any documents not in English that are produced by a Party will be accompanied by a translation into English, which translation will not be binding upon the other Party or the arbitrators. Each Party covenants and agrees that (a) it will produce documents as required by this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution), and (b) it will make its employees, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to make its former employees, available for depositions and hearing testimony as requested by the other Party. The final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be in writing, in all events follow governing law and will be furnished to all the Parties in such dispute. Judgment on such decision may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators' award. Except as required by Applicable Law or to enforce an arbitrators' award, neither Party may disclose the existence, contents or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with this Agreement, or the evidence produced by its opposing Parties, or any analysis or summaries derived from such evidence. The Parties agree that all applicable statutes of limitation and time-based defenses (such as estoppel and laches) will be tolled while the procedures set forth in this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) are pending. The Parties will cooperate in taking any actions necessary to achieve this result. Except as may be determined by the arbitrators, neither Party shall be penalized for delays resulting from dispute resolution conducted pursuant to this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution). 14.5.3 Equitable Remedies; Single Forum. Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, either Party may seek a preliminary injunction or other provisional equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as permitted by Applicable Law. At all times while any claim, action, suit or other proceeding between the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates (or among the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates and one or more Third Parties) arising out of or relating to this Agreement is pending in any court of competent jurisdiction, no dispute that is justiciable and can be joined to such pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) without both Parties' mutual consent and, instead, either Party may join such dispute to the pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding by including such dispute in its pleadings or amending its pleadings. In the event that a motion to amend is required to achieve such joinder, the non- moving Party shall consent to such motion.

This Agreement will be interpreted and construed exclusively under the laws of the State of Texas, which laws will prevail in the event of any conflict of law (without regard to, and without giving effect to, the application of Texas choice-of-law rules); provided, however, that if the covenants in Section 19 of this Agreement would not be enforced as written under Texas law, then the parties agree that those covenants will instead be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which the Franchised Business is located. Nothing in this Section 27.1 is intended by the parties to invoke the application of any franchise, business opportunity, antitrust, implied covenant, unfair competition, fiduciary, and/or other doctrine of law of the State of Texas (or any other state) that would not otherwise apply without this Section 27.1. 27.2 Choice of Venue. Subject to Section 27.3 below, the parties agree that any action that you bring against us, in any court, whether federal or state, must be brought only within the state and judicial district in which we maintain our principal place of business. Any action that we bring against you in any court, whether federal or state, may be brought within the state and judicial district in which we maintain our principal place of business. 27.2.1 The parties agree that this Section 27.2 will not be construed as preventing either party from removing an action from state to federal court; provided, however, that venue will be as set forth above. 27.2.2 The parties hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision. 27.2.3 Any such action will be conducted on an individual basis, and not as part of a consolidated, common, or class action. 27.3 Mediation. Before any party may bring an action in court against the other, the parties agree that they must first meet to mediate the dispute (except as otherwise provided in Section 27.5 below). Any such mediation will be non-binding and will be conducted in accordance with the then-current rules for mediation of commercial disputes of JAMS, Inc. (formerly, "Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.") at its location nearest to our then-current principal place of business. 27.4 Parties Rights Are Cumulative. No right or remedy conferred upon or reserved to us or you by this Agreement is intended to be, nor will be deemed, exclusive of any other right or remedy herein or by law or equity provided or permitted, but each will be cumulative of every other right or remedy. 27.5 Injunctions. Nothing contained in this Agreement will bar our right to obtain injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction against threatened conduct that will cause us loss or damages, under the usual equity rules, including the applicable rules for obtaining restraining orders and preliminary injunctions. 27.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIALS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM, WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT BY EITHER OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER, WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE OTHER PARTIES IN SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING. 27.7 MUST BRING CLAIMS WITHIN ONE YEAR. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT AGREES THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES' RELATIONSHIP, AND/OR YOUR OPERATION OF THE FRANCHISED BUSINESS, BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY HERETO AGAINST THE OTHER, SHALL BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE OCCURRENCE OF THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM OR ACTION, OR, IT IS EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGED AND AGREED BY ALL PARTIES, SUCH CLAIM OR ACTION SHALL BE IRREVOCABLY BARRED. 27.8 WAIVER OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT TO OR CLAIM OF ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE OTHER, AND AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM EACH SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE RECOVERY OF ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY IT. 27.9 Payment of Legal Fees. You agree to pay us all damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses) that we incur after the termination or expiration of the franchise granted under this Agreement in: (a) obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation Sections 9 and 17 above); and/or (b) successfully defending a claim from you that we misrepresented the terms of this Agreement, fraudulently induced you to sign this Agreement, that the provisions of this Agreement are not fair, were not properly entered into, and/or that the terms of this Agreement (as it may be amended by its terms) do not exclusively govern the parties' relationship. 28 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 28.1 Your Investigation of the Franchised Business Possibilities. You acknowledge and agree that you have conducted an independent investigation of the business franchised under this Agreement, recognize that this business venture involves business risks, and that your success will be largely dependent upon your ability (or, if you are an entity, your owners as independent businesspersons). 28.2 No Warranties or Guarantees. We expressly disclaim the making of, and you acknowledge and agree that you have not received, any warranty or guarantee, express or implied, as to the potential volume, profits, or success of the business venture contemplated by this Agreement. 28.3 Receipt of FDD and Complete Agreement. You acknowledge and agree receipt of a copy of this Agreement, the exhibit(s), and agreements relating to this Agreement (if any), with all of the blank lines filled in, with ample time within which to review with applicable advisors. You also acknowledge that you received the FDD at least fourteen (14) days before the date on which this Agreement was signed. 28.4 You Have Read the Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood the FDD, this Agreement, and the exhibits to this Agreement. 28.5 Your Advisors. You acknowledge that we have recommended that you seek advice from advisors of your own choosing (including a lawyer and an accountant) about the potential benefits and risks of entering into this Agreement, and that you have had sufficient time and opportunity to consult with those advisors. 28.6 No Conflicting Obligations. Each party represents and warrants to the others that there are no other agreements, court orders, or any other legal obligations that would preclude or in any manner restrict such party from: (a) negotiating and entering into this Agreement; (b) exercising its rights under this Agreement; and/or (c) fulfilling its responsibilities under this Agreement. 28.7 Your Responsibility for the Choice of the Approved Location. You acknowledge and agree that you have sole and complete responsibility for the choice of the Approved Location; that we have not (and will not be deemed to have, even by our approval of the site that is the Approved Location) given any representation, promise, or guarantee of your success at the Approved Location; and that you will be solely responsible for your own success at the Approved Location. 28.8 Your Responsibility for Operation of the Franchised Business. Although we retain the right to establish and periodically modify System standards, which you have agreed to maintain in the operation of your Franchised Business, you retain the right and sole responsibility for the day-to-day management and operation of the Franchised Business and the implementation and maintenance of system standards at the Franchised Business. 28.9 Different Franchise Offerings to Others. You acknowledge and agree that we may modify the terms under which we will offer franchises to other parties in any manner and at any time, which offers and agreements have or may have terms, conditions, and obligations that may differ from the terms, conditions, and obligations in this Agreement. 28.10 Our Advice. You acknowledge and agree that our advice is just that; that our advice is not a guarantee of success; and that you are the party that must reach and implement your own decisions about how to operate your Franchised Business on a day-to-day basis under the System. 28.11 Your Independence. You acknowledge and agree that: 28.11.1 you are the only party that employs your employees (even though we may provide you with advice, guidance, and training); 28.11.2 we are not your employer nor are we the employer of any of your staff, and even if we express an opinion or provide advice, we will play no role in your decisions regarding their employment (including matters such as recruitment, hiring, compensation, scheduling, employee relations, labor matters, review, discipline, and/or dismissal); 28.11.3 the guidance that we provide, and requirements under which you will operate, are intended to promote and protect the value of the brand and the Proprietary Marks; 28.11.4 when forming and in operating your business, you had to adopt standards to operate that business, and that instead of developing and implementing your own standards (or those of another party), you chose to adopt and implement our standards for your business (including our System and the requirements under this Agreement); and 28.11.5 you have made (and will remain responsible at all times for) all of the organizational and basic decisions about establishing and forming your entity, operating your business (including adopting our standards as your standards), and hiring employees and employment matters (including matters such as recruitment, hiring, compensation, scheduling, employee relations, labor matters, review, discipline, and/or dismissal), engaging professional advisors, and all other facets of your operation. 28.12 Success Depends on You. You acknowledge and agree that the success of the business venture contemplated under this Agreement is speculative and depends, to a large extent, upon your ability as an independent businessperson, your active participation in the daily affairs of the business, market conditions, area competition, availability of product, quality of services provided as well as other factors. We do not make any representation or warranty express or implied as to the potential success of the business venture contemplated hereby. 28.13 Two or More Signatories. If two or more persons are signing this Agreement as the "Franchisee" (each, a "Signatory"), the parties agree that: 28.13.1 Each Signatory will have the power to individually bind "Franchisee" with respect to us and third parties; 28.13.2 We have the right to treat each Signatory as having the full authority to bind all other Signatories in any and all matters; 28.13.3 We have the right to treat each Signatory as if s/he represents and can act on behalf of all the other Signatory(ies) in all matters; 28.13.4 Even though there may be more than one Signatory, all of the Signatories' rights will be one and none of the Signatories will have the right to exercise any right independent of (and/or apart from) one another; 28.13.5 We have the right to communicate with or provide notice to any Signatory, and such communication or notice will be deemed as having been given to all Signatories; and 28.13.6 If there is a conflict among the Signatories (including us receiving conflicting information from or requests between the Signatories), we have the right to select from among any conflicting or inconsistent requests by, or information from, any of the Signatories, and our selection in such case will be final and dispositive with respect to any such conflict. 28.14 General Release.

Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, shall be solely and finally settled by binding arbitration pursuant to then-current rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York. The merits of the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to its choice of law rules. The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, each of whom shall be knowledgeable in the subject matter hereof. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, and all documents shall be submitted in English or be accompanied by a certified English translation. The arbitrators will provide a written explanation to the parties of any arbitration award. The award thereof shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment on such award may be entered in any court or tribunal having jurisdiction, and the parties hereby irrevocably waive any objection to the jurisdiction of such courts based on any ground, including without limitation, improper venue or forum non conveniens. The parties and the arbitration panel shall be bound to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement, the dispute and any award, except to the extent necessary to enforce any such award. The prevailing party, if a party is so designated in the arbitration award, shall be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and fees, including attorneys' fees, associated with such arbitration. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, the parties understand that they are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a dispute between the parties were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party shall be entitled, at any time, without first resorting to the dispute resolution process set forth above, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, wherever such party deems appropriate, in order to preserve or enforce such party's rights hereunder.

The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve all claims, disputes, and other disagreements arising out of or related to this Agreement. In the event that a dispute between the Parties cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days of written notice from one Party to the other Party, such dispute shall, at the request of either Party, after providing written notice to the other Party, be determined and settled by arbitration in Baltimore, Maryland, in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq., and the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The notice of arbitration shall specifically describe the claims, disputes, or other matters in issue to be submitted to arbitration. The Parties shall jointly select a single arbitrator who shall have the authority to hold hearings and to render a decision in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If the Parties are unable to agree within ten (10) days, the arbitrator shall be selected by the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The written decision of the arbitrator so appointed shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties and enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne by the non-prevailing Party to the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the reasonable cost of experts, evidence, and legal counsel. Whenever the action is required to be taken under this Agreement within a specified period of time and the taking of such action is materially affected by a matter submitted to arbitration, such period shall automatically be extended by the number of days, plus ten (10), that are taken for the determination of that matter by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree to use their best reasonable efforts to minimize the costs and frequency or arbitration hereunder. In addition, both Parties agree to use their best efforts to cause a final decision to be rendered with respect to the matters submitted to arbitration within sixty (60) days after its submission.

            Error message: Could not find section in text: 13.3. Arbitration. 13.3.1 Resolution of Disputes. If a Dispute arises between the parties, the parties agree to use the following procedures in good faith to resolve such Dispute promptly and non judicially. For purposes of this Agreement, "Dispute" shall mean any alleged material breach of any representation, warranty or obligation herein, or a disagreement regarding the interpretation, performance or nonperformance of any provision thereof, or the validity, scope and enforceability of these dispute resolution procedures, or any dispute regarding any damages arising from the termination of this Agreement. Any party may give written notice to any other party of the existence of a Dispute (a "Dispute Notice"). 13.3.2 Negotiation. Within five (5) days after delivery of any Dispute Notice the parties involved in the Dispute shall meet at a mutually agreeable time and place and thereafter as often as they deem reasonably necessary to exchange relevant information and attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the Dispute. If the Dispute has not been resolved within ten (10) days after the first meeting of the parties, or, if the party receiving the Dispute Notice will not meet within ten (10) days after receipt of the Dispute Notice, then either party may, by delivering notice to the other party, commence arbitration proceedings. 13.3.3 General Dispute Resolution Provisions. (a) All deadlines specified in this Section 13.3 may be extended by mutual agreement. The procedures specified in this Section 13.3 are an essential provision of this Agreement and are legally binding on the parties. These procedures shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of any Dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Any and all actions to enforce the obligations under this Section 13.3 shall be brought in any court specified in Section 13.1. (b) The parties acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 13.3 are intended to provide a private resolution of Disputes between them. Accordingly, all documents, records, and other information relating to the Dispute shall at all times be maintained in the strictest confi- dence and not disclosed to any third party, other than the arbitrators, except where specifically allowed hereunder. All proceedings, communications and negotiations pursuant to this Section 13.3 are confidential. In the event of any judicial challenge to, or enforcement of, any order or award hereunder, any party may designate such portions of the record of such proceedings, communications, and negotiations as such party deems appropriate to be filed under seal. All pro- ceedings, communications and negotiations pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall be treated as com- promise negotiations for all purposes, including for purposes of the US Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence. None of the statements, disclosures, offers, or communications (or other assertions made in any proceeding or negotiation) made pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall be deemed admissions, nor shall any of said statements, disclosures, offers, communications or assertions be admissible for any purpose other than the enforcement of the terms of this Section 13.3. (c) The parties agree to act in good faith to comply with all of their respective obligations under this Agreement as much as possible as if there were no Dispute during any pending mediation or arbitration hereunder. (d) The parties agree that the terms of this Section 13.3 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. (e) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. The parties agree to have any Dispute that is not resolved pursuant to the procedures established in Section 13.3(a) - (c) decided by neutral arbitration as provided in this Section 13.3(e) and the parties are giving up any rights they might possess to have the Dispute litigated in a court or by a jury trial. The parties are giving up their judicial rights to discovery and appeal, unless such rights are specifically included in this Section 13.3(e). The parties acknowledge and agree that their agreement to this arbitration provision is voluntary. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT AND IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE OR ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION OR SUIT (IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING.

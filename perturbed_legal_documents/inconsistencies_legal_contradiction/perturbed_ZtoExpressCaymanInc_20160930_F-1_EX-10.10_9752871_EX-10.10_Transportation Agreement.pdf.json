                "original_text": "In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the standard rate of RMB200 per parcel, and indemnify the actual price for high-end insured parcel (or indemnify by the value of the parcel provided by arbitration department determined by Party A).",

                "explanation": "By setting the indemnification rate to RMB20 per parcel regardless of actual value or insurance, the contract creates a scenario where the compensation is unreasonably low and may not adequately cover the actual losses incurred by Party A. This contradicts Article 312 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, which requires compensation to be equivalent to the loss suffered or as agreed by the parties but not unreasonably low. Setting a rate so low that it doesn't cover the cost of the damage could be considered against fair business practices.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the objection period for invoices to one week, which contradicts standard business practices and legal expectations in Germany (where the jurisdiction is located). German law generally provides for longer periods for reviewing and disputing invoices, and reducing it to one week may be considered unreasonably short, particularly for complex or substantial invoices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with general principles of good faith and fair dealing under German Civil Code (BGB) if the one-week period is deemed unreasonably short.",

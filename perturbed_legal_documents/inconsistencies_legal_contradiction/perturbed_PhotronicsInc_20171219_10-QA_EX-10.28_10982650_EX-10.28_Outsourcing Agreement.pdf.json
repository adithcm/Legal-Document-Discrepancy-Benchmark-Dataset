                "explanation": "The original contract states that payments will be made within a certain timeframe from shipment of products delivered. By changing this timeframe to 180 days, the modification could create inconsistency with standard business practice and potentially violate the laws of the People's Republic of China which would likely have shorter legally mandated payment terms for goods and services. Such extended payment terms may also be deemed unfair or exploitative, particularly if the Suppliers are smaller entities.",

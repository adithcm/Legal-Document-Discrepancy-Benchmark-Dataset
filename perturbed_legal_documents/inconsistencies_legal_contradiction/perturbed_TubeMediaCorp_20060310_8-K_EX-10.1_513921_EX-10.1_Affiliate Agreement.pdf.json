                "original_text": "(b) Network shall submit to Affiliate, within forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, a statement reporting for such calendar quarter the following information on a Station-by-Station basis: (i) Network’s Advertising Revenue, (ii) the Affiliate Advertising Share, (iii) Network’s Transactional Revenue, (iv) the average number of households receiving the Service through each MVPD in each DMA served by a Station, as calculated herein, and (v) the Affiliate Transactional Share. If this Agreement terminates on any date other than at the end of a calendar quarter, Network shall supply such statement as of the date of termination, within forty-five (45) days thereafter, and this obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement until Affiliate receives such statement.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Network shall submit to Affiliate, within ninety (90) days of the end of each calendar year during the Term, a statement reporting for such calendar year the following information on an aggregate basis: (i) Network’s Advertising Revenue, (ii) the Affiliate Advertising Share, (iii) Network’s Transactional Revenue, (iv) the average number of households receiving the Service through each MVPD, and (v) the Affiliate Transactional Share. If this Agreement terminates on any date other than at the end of a calendar year, Network shall supply such statement as of the date of termination, within one hundred and eighty (180) days thereafter, and this obligation shall be deemed fulfilled six months after termination.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because the original text requires quarterly reports within 45 days, ensuring timely and consistent financial transparency. By changing it to annual reports within 90 days and fulfilling obligations six months after termination, the modification drastically reduces the frequency and timeliness of financial reporting. This could violate state laws requiring more frequent and transparent accounting practices, particularly in agreements involving revenue sharing. Some states mandate detailed financial reports to be provided more frequently than annually to ensure accountability and prevent financial mismanagement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws regarding financial transparency and reporting frequency (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley-like regulations at the state level, or specific business regulations in states like Delaware or California that mandate regular and timely financial disclosures, depending on where the companies are registered or operate).",

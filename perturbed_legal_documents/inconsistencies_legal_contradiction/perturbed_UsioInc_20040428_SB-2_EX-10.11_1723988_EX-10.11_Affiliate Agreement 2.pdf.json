                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for non-renewal from 30 days to 7 days creates a legal contradiction. Many jurisdictions, including some states within the US and general contract law principles, require a reasonable notice period for contract termination or non-renewal, especially in agreements involving ongoing business relationships. A 7-day notice may be deemed unreasonable and therefore unenforceable, depending on the specific circumstances and the jurisdiction's legal standards.",

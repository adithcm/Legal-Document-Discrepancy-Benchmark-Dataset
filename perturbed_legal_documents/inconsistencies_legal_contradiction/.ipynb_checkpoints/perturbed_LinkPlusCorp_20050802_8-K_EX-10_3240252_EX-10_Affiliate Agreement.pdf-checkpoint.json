                "original_text": "No action, case, suit or proceeding, regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement, may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen, or in the case of nonpayment, more than two (2) years from the date of the last payment.",

                "explanation": "The original contract stipulates a one-year limitation period for legal actions, which is permissible under Maryland law. By reducing this to six months, the modified text could be seen as unreasonably short and potentially violating the legal principle that contractual limitations periods must be reasonable and provide sufficient time for a party to discover and pursue a claim. Maryland's statute of limitations for contract claims is 3 years. This could invalidate the clause, making it unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Maryland Statute of Limitations for Contract Claims - Courts may deem a six-month limitation period unreasonably short, especially concerning complex business disputes.",

                "changed_text": "14.1 Failure by Allied to perform and comply with any of its obligations in sections 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and Newegg shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if Allied fails to cure the breach within five (5) days following Newegg’s written notice of the breach.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 15-day cure period for breaches. Shortening this period to 5 days is a legal contradiction because such a short cure period may be deemed unreasonable, particularly in California where this contract is governed, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts. Courts in California are wary of cure periods that are too short to allow a party to reasonably remedy a breach.",

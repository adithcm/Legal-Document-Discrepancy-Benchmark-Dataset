                "explanation": "The original agreement requires full payment upon signing. The modified version allows payment within 180 days. Florida Statute 83.06(1) addresses fraudulent inducement to rent and requires payment at the beginning of the rental agreement. This change introduces a contradiction as it may be argued that the sponsorship is a form of rental or lease, and extending the payment period to 180 days could be construed as conflicting with the requirement for upfront payment, particularly if services are rendered before payment is completed.",

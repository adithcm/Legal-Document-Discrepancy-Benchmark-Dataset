                "explanation": "The original text requires reporting of unauthorized disclosures within five days. HIPAA regulations require covered entities and business associates to have policies and procedures to detect and report breaches of protected health information (PHI). While HIPAA does not mandate a specific timeframe for internal reporting, a 5-day window may be considered insufficient for identifying, investigating, and reporting complex breaches, potentially leading to non-compliance if investigations are rushed or incomplete. Extending the reporting period to 90 days creates a conflict with the expectation of timely breach reporting and mitigation.",

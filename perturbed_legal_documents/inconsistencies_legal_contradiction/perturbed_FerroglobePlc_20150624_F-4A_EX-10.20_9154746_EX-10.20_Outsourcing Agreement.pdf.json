According to Spanish Law 3/2004, which establishes measures to combat late payments in commercial transactions, the standard payment term is 30 days unless otherwise agreed, and any extension beyond 60 days must be explicitly agreed upon and justified. By unilaterally setting a 90-day payment term without justification or explicit agreement, the modified text contradicts Spanish payment regulations.",

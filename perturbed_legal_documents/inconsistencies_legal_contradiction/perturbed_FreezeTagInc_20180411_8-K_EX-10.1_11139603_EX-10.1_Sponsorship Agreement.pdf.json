                "explanation": "The original agreement stated that the remaining balance of $25,000 was due March 30, 2020. The changed agreement shifts the final payment due date to December 31, 2021. This creates a contradiction because the term of the agreement is specified in Section 3: 'This Agreement shall commence on March 15, 2018 and will expire on March 14, 2020 unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 13 of the Agreement (the “Term”).' By scheduling a payment to occur significantly after the stated expiration date of the agreement, the payment terms become inconsistent with the contract's defined duration and may be unenforceable under contract law, as the agreement would have expired before the final payment is due.",

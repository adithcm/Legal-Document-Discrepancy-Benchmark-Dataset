                "changed_text": "Any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined by binding arbitration, waiving all rights to pursue claims in a court of law. The arbitration must commence within 60 days of the dispute arising, regardless of any statutory limitation periods.",
                "explanation": "This change forces binding arbitration, potentially waiving rights to a jury trial guaranteed by law. Additionally, setting a 60-day limit to commence arbitration contradicts Michigan's statute of limitations for contract disputes, which is typically longer (6 years). This unreasonably shortens the time to pursue a claim, potentially barring valid legal recourse.",

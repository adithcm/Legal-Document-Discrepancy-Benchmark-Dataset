                "original_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall give Equidata written demand of dispute within 10 days of the due date of the invoice. The demand shall set forth a statement for the nature of the dispute and the amount involved. If Equidata and Marketing Affiliate can not resolve the dispute on their own within 10 days after Equidata receive said dispute, the parties shall jointly select an arbitrator.",
                "changed_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall give Equidata written demand of dispute within 5 days of the due date of the invoice. The demand shall set forth a statement for the nature of the dispute and the amount involved. If Equidata and Marketing Affiliate can not resolve the dispute on their own within 3 days after Equidata receive said dispute, the parties shall jointly select an arbitrator.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement allows for a 10-day dispute notification and resolution period. By shortening these periods to 5 and 3 days respectively, the modification unreasonably restricts the Marketing Affiliate's ability to formally dispute charges, potentially conflicting with general principles of contract law that require reasonable opportunity to address disputes.",

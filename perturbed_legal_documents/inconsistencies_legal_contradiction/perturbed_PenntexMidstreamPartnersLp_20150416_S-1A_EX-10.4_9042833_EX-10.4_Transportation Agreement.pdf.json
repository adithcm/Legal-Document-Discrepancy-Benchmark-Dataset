                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a 15-day payment term. By extending this to 60 days, the modification introduces a provision that may conflict with standard and reasonable payment terms under Texas law, particularly if the industry standard is significantly shorter. While Texas law does not explicitly mandate a specific payment deadline for gas transportation agreements, unreasonably long payment terms could be deemed unconscionable or a breach of good faith and fair dealing, especially if it places undue hardship on the transporter. Therefore, extending the payment term to 60 days introduces a potentially unenforceable term that contradicts common business practices and could be seen as exploiting the transporter. Additionally, in some circumstances, such changes could run afoul of prompt payment laws depending on the specifics of the transaction.",

                "original_text": "As a condition precedent to recovery by Shipper for loss, damage, or delay in receipt or delivery of Shipper’s Products for which Carrier may be responsible, Shipper’s claim must be filed in writing with Carrier within nine (9) months after delivery of the affected Products, or, in case of Carrier’s failure to make delivery of Shipper’s Products, then within nine (9) months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits shall be instituted against Carrier only within two (2) years and one (1) day from the day when notice in writing is given by Carrier to Shipper that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted by Shipper on such claims in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such claims will not be paid and Carrier will not be liable.",
                "changed_text": "As a condition precedent to recovery by Shipper for loss, damage, or delay in receipt or delivery of Shipper’s Products for which Carrier may be responsible, Shipper’s claim must be filed in writing with Carrier within six (6) months after delivery of the affected Products, or, in case of Carrier’s failure to make delivery of Shipper’s Products, then within six (6) months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits shall be instituted against Carrier only within one (1) year from the day when notice in writing is given by Carrier to Shipper that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted by Shipper on such claims in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such claims will not be paid and Carrier will not be liable.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the claim filing and suit filing deadlines, which contradicts standard legal statutes of limitations. Louisiana law may provide longer periods for certain claims, making the contract's shorter deadlines unenforceable and creating a legal contradiction. The original text provides 9 months for claim filing and 2 years and one day for suits. The modified version reduces this to 6 months and 1 year respectively.",

                "original_text": "11.9 Arbitration. The Parties shall use their respective best efforts to settle amicably any disputes, differences or controversies arising between the Parties out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement. However, if not so settled, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and finally settled by confidential binding arbitration, except as specifically provided otherwise herein. The confidential arbitration proceeding shall be held in Collin County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the alternative dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration proceeding shall be held before a single arbitrator unless (i) the matter in controversy exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), (ii) the Parties cannot agree on the arbitrator, or (iii) either Party requests a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and any order of enforcement as the case may be. The arbitrator shall not award any Party punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages, and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right to seek such damages in arbitration or in judicial proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration, and the fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator shall have the right and authority to apportion among the parties all reasonable costs, including attorneysâ€™ fees and witness fees, taking into account the relative fault of the Parties. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11.9 do not limit the right of a Party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending resolution of a dispute by arbitration.",
                "changed_text": "11.9 Arbitration. The Parties may, at their discretion, attempt to settle any disputes, differences or controversies arising between the Parties out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement. However, if not settled, then the same shall be submitted to non-binding arbitration. The arbitration proceeding will occur wherever the Hydraspin chooses. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted without any set of rules. The arbitrator shall not be limited in their ability to award punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages, and each Party retains all rights to seek such damages in arbitration or in judicial proceedings. Hydraspin shall have no obligation to pay for any costs related to arbitration. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11.9, limit the right of Distributor to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending resolution of a dispute by arbitration.",
                "explanation": "The modification makes the arbitration clause non-binding, allows Hydraspin to choose the venue without limitations, removes the need for a specific set of rules, permits the arbitrator to award damages explicitly waived under Texas law, and removes the obligation for Hydraspin to pay arbitration costs. This contradicts Texas law which requires clear and unequivocal language for binding arbitration and adherence to specific rules and procedures. It further hinders the distributor's ability to seek equitable relief, effectively undermining the fairness and enforceability of the arbitration agreement.",

                "explanation": "The contract states that mPhase Technologies Inc. is a New Jersey corporation, but it has been modified to state that mPhase Technologies Inc. is a Delaware corporation. This contradicts the factual basis and potentially the legal standing of the agreement if mPhase is indeed registered in New Jersey and not Delaware. This could lead to challenges regarding jurisdiction, applicable corporate law, and the validity of actions taken by mPhase under this agreement.",

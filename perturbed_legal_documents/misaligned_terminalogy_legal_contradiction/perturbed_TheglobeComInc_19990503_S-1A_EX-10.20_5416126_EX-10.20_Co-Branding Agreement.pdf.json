                "original_text": "The parties are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, franchise, joint venture or employment relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. Neither party shall make any warranties or representations on behalf of the other party.",
                "changed_text": "The parties are deemed 'partners' for the purposes of this agreement, sharing profits and losses equally. This agreement establishes a general partnership, where each party is an agent of the other and is jointly and severally liable for the actions of the partnership.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states the parties are independent contractors and not partners. The modified clause directly contradicts this by stating they are 'partners' and establishes a general partnership. This creates a legal contradiction because a general partnership has specific legal implications (e.g., joint and several liability) that are inconsistent with an independent contractor relationship. This change directly impacts the legal obligations and liabilities of each party, contradicting the original intent and potentially leading to unintended legal consequences.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Florida state law, the contract creates ambiguity regarding which specific state laws govern if a conflict arises. Florida law may provide specific protections or regulations relevant to distribution agreements or intellectual property rights that are now unclear. This weakens the enforceability and predictability of the agreement, potentially contradicting established commercial law principles that rely on clear jurisdictional directives.",

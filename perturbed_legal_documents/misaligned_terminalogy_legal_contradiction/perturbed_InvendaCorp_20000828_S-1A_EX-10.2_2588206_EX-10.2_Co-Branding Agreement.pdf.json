                "original_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means\ninformation about the disclosing party's (or its suppliers') business\nor activities that is proprietary and confidential, which shall\ninclude all business, financial, technical and other information of a\nparty marked or designated by such party as \"confidential\" or\n\"proprietary\"; or information which, by the nature of the\ncircumstances surrounding the disclosure, ought in good faith to be\ntreated as confidential.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Confidential Information' was replaced with 'Private Data,' and the definition was modified to state that information that should be treated as confidential is now treated as non-confidential. This directly contradicts the standard legal meaning of 'Confidential Information,' which includes an obligation to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure. Additionally, it creates a contradiction within the contract itself, as the modified definition states that information which should be confidential should now be treated as non-confidential.",

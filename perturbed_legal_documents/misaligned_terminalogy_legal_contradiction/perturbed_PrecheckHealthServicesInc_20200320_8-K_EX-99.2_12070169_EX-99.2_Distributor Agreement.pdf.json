                "original_text": "The Distributor is an independent contractor and nothing contained in this agreement shall be deemed or interpreted to constitute the Distributor as a partner or employee of the Principal, nor shall either party have any authority to bind the other in any respect, it being understood and agreed that all orders submitted by the Distributor are subject to acceptance by Principal in its sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor is an independent contractor; however, the Principal retains the right to direct the manner and means by which the Distributor performs its services, and the Distributor shall be considered an agent of the Principal for all purposes relating to the sale of Products.",
                "explanation": "By stating the Principal directs the distributor's work and that the distributor is an agent, this contradicts the definition of an 'independent contractor' under both IRS guidelines and common law. Independent contractors are defined as self-employed individuals hired to perform a specific task or service for another party. The hiring party maintains control over the project's outcome but typically doesn't dictate how the work is done. By claiming that Principal will direct the distributor's work, this clause creates an employer-employee or principal-agent relationship, negating the independent contractor classification. The statement that the distributor is an agent further contradicts their classification as independent contractors.",

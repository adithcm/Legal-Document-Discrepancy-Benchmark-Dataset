                "explanation": "The term 'Net Sales' is modified to contradict established accounting principles like Japan GAAP or IFRS. The original definition requires consistent application of accounting standards. The modified text allows for 'arbitrarily allowed' deductions and inconsistent application of accounting standards, conflicting with standard accounting practices for revenue recognition and potentially violating financial reporting regulations, thus making the contract non-compliant. This could directly impact revenue calculations, taxation, and regulatory reporting.",

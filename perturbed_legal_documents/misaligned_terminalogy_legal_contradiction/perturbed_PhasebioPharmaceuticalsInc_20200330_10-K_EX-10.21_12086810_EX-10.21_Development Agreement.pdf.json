                "explanation": "The term **\"Affiliate\"** is legally defined under securities regulations like the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to involve common control, typically ownership of 50% or more of the voting stock. By replacing **\"control\"** with **\"influence\"** and removing the specific ownership threshold, the contract broadens the definition in a way that it introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction. This creates a legal uncertainty because the term **\"influence\"** is vague, lacks a clear statutory or regulatory definition, and can be interpreted subjectively. This misaligns with legally recognized definitions of control.",

                "original_text": "27.1 Choice of Law. The validity, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement shall be controlled by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, as if performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law, and the state and federal courts of California shall have jurisdiction over any claim arising under this Agreement. The parties specifically disclaim the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek interim injunctive relief in any court of appropriate jurisdiction with respect to any alleged breach of such party's intellectual property or proprietary rights.",
                "changed_text": "27.1 Choice of Law. The validity, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement shall be controlled by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, as if performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law, and the state and federal courts of California shall have jurisdiction over any claim arising under this Agreement. The parties specifically agree that the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods *SHALL* govern this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies New York law while disclaiming the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The modified clause specifies Delaware law and states that CISG *SHALL* govern the agreement. Since this is an international sales agreement, the CISG would automatically apply unless explicitly disclaimed. Removing the disclaimer and affirmatively agreeing that the CISG applies, when the agreement specifies US law creates a direct contradiction of law and could lead to disputes over which body of law governs the agreement. Delaware law may contradict CISG law.",

                "original_text": "10.5. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. In connection with this Agreement, each\nparty is an independent contractor. This Agreement does not, and shall not be\nconstrued to, create an employer-employee, agency, joint venture or partnership\nrelationship between the parties. Neither party shall have any authority to act\nfor or to bind the other party in any way, to alter any of the terms or\nconditions of any of the other party's standard forms of invoices, sales\nagreements, warranties or otherwise, or to warrant or to execute agreements on\nbehalf of the other or to represent that it is in any way responsible for the\nacts, debts, liabilities or omissions of the other party.",
                "changed_text": "10.5. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. In connection with this Agreement, each\nparty is an independent contractor. This Agreement does not create an employer-employee relationship between the parties. However, each party may act as an agent for the other in specific instances as mutually agreed upon in writing. Each party shall have limited authority to bind the other party, specifically in marketing and promotional activities related to the Co-Branded Site. Each party will represent that it is responsible for the debts, liabilities or omissions of the other party when dealing with third-party vendors for the Co-Branded Site.",
                "explanation": "The modification contradicts the definition of 'independent contractor'. An independent contractor, under common law and IRS guidelines, does not typically have the authority to bind the other party, act as an agent, or represent responsibility for the other party's liabilities. This change creates an agency relationship and shared liability, blurring the lines of independence and potentially misclassifying the relationship, which can have tax and legal implications under federal and state labor laws.",

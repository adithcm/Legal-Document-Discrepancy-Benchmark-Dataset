Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to constitute the Parties as partners, employees, agents or joint ventures of each other. No Party will have the authority to bind the other Party in any respect.",

Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to constitute the Parties as partners, employees, agents or joint ventures of each other. No Party will have the authority to bind the other Party in any respect.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the developer will work under the 'direct supervision' of the client and the client will determine the hours and location of work, we are contradicting the classification of 'independent contractor' which requires the contractor to have control over their work. This reclassification causes non-compliance with labor laws regarding misclassification of employees as independent contractors.",

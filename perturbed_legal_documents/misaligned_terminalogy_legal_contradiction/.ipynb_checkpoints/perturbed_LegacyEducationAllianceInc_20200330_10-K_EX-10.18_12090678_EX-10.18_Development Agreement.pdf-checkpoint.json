                "original_text": "14.10 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to its provisions concerning the applicability of the laws of other jurisdictions, and specifically excluding the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.",

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its provisions concerning the applicability of the laws of other jurisdictions, and specifically including the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New York to Delaware and including the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) introduces legal risk. The CISG is typically excluded from contracts between US parties due to its different legal framework. Including it, especially without careful consideration of its implications, contradicts common contracting practice and could lead to unintended legal consequences if the agreement involves international aspects or disputes. Delaware law also differs from New York law which will cause unpredicted implications.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies based on specific provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods and the laws of Delaware in relation to contract interpretation and enforcement as compared to New York law. The key contradiction lies in including CISG when it's typically excluded in purely domestic US contracts.",

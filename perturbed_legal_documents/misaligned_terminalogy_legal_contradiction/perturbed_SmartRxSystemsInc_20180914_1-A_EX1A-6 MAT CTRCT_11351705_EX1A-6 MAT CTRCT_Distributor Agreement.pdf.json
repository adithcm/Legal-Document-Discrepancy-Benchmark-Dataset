                "explanation": "Changing the relationship from 'independent contractor' to 'employee' directly contradicts the intended nature of the agreement. This misclassification has significant legal ramifications under both Texas and U.S. Federal labor laws (e.g., Fair Labor Standards Act) regarding minimum wage, overtime, payroll taxes, and benefits eligibility. An independent contractor is not entitled to these protections, while an employee is. Misclassifying an employee as an independent contractor can lead to substantial penalties and legal action from the misclassified employee or government agencies.",

Distributor can find more information about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, or by contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will comply with all country, federal, state and local suggestions, guidelines, recommendations, and optional procedures, but is not required to follow any strict laws, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, or policies. Distributor is not required to comply with any anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Applicable Laws). Distributor can find more information about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, or by contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the distributor is not required to comply with anti-corruption laws, directly conflicting with the original clause and the implied obligations under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This modification seeks to eliminate the mandatory aspect of legal compliance by reclassifying legal requirements as mere suggestions, fundamentally altering the distributor's legal obligations.",

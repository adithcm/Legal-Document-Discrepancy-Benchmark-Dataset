                "original_text": "Cisco warrants that commencing from the date of shipment to Customer (but in case of resale by an authorized Cisco reseller, commencing not more than ninety (90) days after original shipment by Cisco), and continuing for a period of the longer of (a) ninety (90) days or (b) the software warranty period (if any) set forth in the warranty card accompanying the Product (if any): (a) the media on which the Software is furnished will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal useÍ¾ and (b) the Software substantially conforms to its published specifications.",
                "changed_text": "Cisco provides the software 'as is' and does not provide any warranties or guarantees regarding the software's fitness for any particular purpose. There is no warranty period for the software, regardless of any representations made by authorized Cisco resellers or any statements contained in accompanying product documentation. All implied warranties, including but not limited to merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, are expressly disclaimed.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a limited warranty, while the modified text completely disclaims all warranties. This contradicts the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which are legally recognized under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and various state laws. While disclaimers are allowed, they must be conspicuous and unambiguous. Completely negating any guarantee goes against standard business practices and deviates from what is legally acceptable.",

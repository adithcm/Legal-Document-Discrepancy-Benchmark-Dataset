                "explanation": "By stating that the confidentiality obligations, specifically regarding trade secrets, do not survive the termination of the agreement, the contract directly contradicts established trade secret law (Uniform Trade Secrets Act adopted in many states including New York, the governing law identified in section 14), which protects trade secrets indefinitely as long as they remain secret and provide a competitive advantage. Limiting the protection of trade secrets to the term of the agreement is a legal contradiction, rendering the confidentiality provisions regarding trade secrets unenforceable after the contract ends.",

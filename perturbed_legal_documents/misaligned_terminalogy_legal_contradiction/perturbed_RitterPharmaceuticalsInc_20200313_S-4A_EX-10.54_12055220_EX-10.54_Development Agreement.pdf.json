                "original_text": "For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an independent contractor and not an agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of the other Party. Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so.",
                "changed_text": "For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an independent contractor and also an agent with the power to enter agreements on behalf of the other party for marketing and sales activities. Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original clause correctly defines the relationship between the parties as 'independent contractors.' The modification contradicts this by simultaneously designating each party as an 'agent' with the power to enter agreements for the other. Under agency law, an agent has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the principal, which conflicts with the arm's length relationship implied by an independent contractor status. This creates a legal contradiction that undermines the original intent of the independent contractor clause and could blur liability, potentially leading to legal disputes. This is a misaligned terminology, where the introduction of 'agent' status along with 'independent contractor' creates a legal conflict.",

                "original_text": "24.1\nThis agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation\n(including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Ohio\nlaw.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from Ohio law to 'International law' creates a misaligned terminology issue. 'International law' is a broad and often vaguely defined term, while the specification of Ohio law provides a clear and established legal framework. This change introduces ambiguity and potential unenforceability, as it's unclear which specific international laws would apply and how they would be interpreted. This contradicts the principle of having a definite and enforceable governing law, leading to potential legal disputes and non-compliance with standard contractual practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring certainty and definiteness in contract terms, and established practices for choice of law clauses.",

                "original_text": "12.6.  Independent Contractors. In connection with this Agreement, each Party is an independent contractor. This Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to, create an employer-employee, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the Parties.  Neither Party shall have any authority to act for or to bind the other Party in any way, to alter any of the terms or conditions of any of the other Party's standard forms of invoices, sales agreements, warranties or otherwise, or to warrant or to execute agreements on behalf of the other or to represent that it is in any way responsible for the acts, debts, liabilities or omissions of the other Party.",
                "changed_text": "12.6.  Independent Contractors. In connection with this Agreement, each Party is an independent contractor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement *shall* be construed to create an agency relationship between the Parties, limited to the scope of marketing and promotion as outlined in Sections 2, 3, and 4. Neither Party shall have any authority to act for or to bind the other Party in any way, to alter any of the terms or conditions of any of the other Party's standard forms of invoices, sales agreements, warranties or otherwise, or to warrant or to execute agreements on behalf of the other or to represent that it is in any way responsible for the acts, debts, liabilities or omissions of the other Party.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The contract explicitly states the parties are independent contractors but then asserts an 'agency relationship' within specific marketing sections. This directly conflicts with the legal definition of 'independent contractor' under Pennsylvania law (specified in Section 12.3), where the key characteristic is the absence of control by the principal over the manner in which the work is performed. By creating an 'agency relationship,' the contract implies a level of control that negates the 'independent contractor' designation, potentially leading to misclassification and violating relevant labor and tax laws. An agency relationship implies one party can act on behalf of another, binding that other party, which the original text expressly denies. This internal contradiction creates legal uncertainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law regarding the definition of an independent contractor and agency relationships, including but not limited to relevant sections of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act and the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, as these laws hinge on the proper classification of workers as either employees, independent contractors, or agents.",

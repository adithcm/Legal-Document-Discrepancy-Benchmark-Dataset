                "explanation": "The modification changes the meaning of 'Delivery Duty Paid (DDP)' by stating that the distributor's price excludes the costs normally included in DDP, directly contradicting the definition of DDP under INCOTERMS® 2010. This introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance, as the responsibility for costs is now unclear and misaligned with the standard international trade term.",

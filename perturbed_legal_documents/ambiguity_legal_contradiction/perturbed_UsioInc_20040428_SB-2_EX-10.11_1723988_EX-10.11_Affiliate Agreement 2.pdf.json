Affiliate agrees to\nsubmit  all  Merchant  Agreements  procured by Affiliate in accordance with this\nAgreement  to  Network 1.  Network 1 will endeavor to review Merchant Agreements submitted by Affiliate to Network 1. Affiliate acknowledges that approval of a Merchant\ncreates  a  customer relationship between Bank and the Merchant. Bank and Network 1 shall exercise commercially reasonable judgment when deciding whether to approve or decline any Merchant Agreement submitted to Bank. Network 1 agrees to consider whether to approve or decline all Merchant\nAgreements  submitted  to  Network  1.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity and weaken the obligation of Network 1 to thoroughly review and approve or decline all merchant agreements. Replacing 'agrees to review and approve or decline' with 'will endeavor to review' makes the review process less mandatory. Changing 'make the final decision... in its sole discretion' to 'exercise commercially reasonable judgment' introduces a vague standard that is open to interpretation. Lastly, 'agrees to make reasonable efforts to review' is replaced with 'agrees to consider whether to approve or decline', weakening the responsibility. This conflicts with the requirements of financial regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, which require financial institutions to conduct thorough due diligence on merchants to prevent illicit activities. By weakening the language around merchant approval, the contract could be interpreted as allowing a lower standard of due diligence, potentially violating BSA/AML requirements.",

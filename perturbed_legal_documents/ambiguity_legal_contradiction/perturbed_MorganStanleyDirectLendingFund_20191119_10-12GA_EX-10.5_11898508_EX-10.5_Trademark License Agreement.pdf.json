                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict obligation to comply with all applicable laws. The modified text replaces 'shall comply at all times' with 'shall endeavor to comply,' weakening the obligation and introducing ambiguity. 'Endeavor' suggests an attempt, rather than a guarantee of compliance, potentially conflicting with the strict regulatory compliance requirements for financial institutions in New York.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York General Business Law, New York Banking Law, and federal securities laws require strict adherence to regulatory standards for financial institutions. The modified clause introduces a degree of optionality that is inconsistent with these requirements.",

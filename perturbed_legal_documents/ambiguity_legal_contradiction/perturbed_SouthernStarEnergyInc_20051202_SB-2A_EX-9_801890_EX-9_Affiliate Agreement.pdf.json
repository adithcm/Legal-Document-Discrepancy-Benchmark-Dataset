                "original_text": "The Affiliate shall take due care to ensure that no unauthorized parties learn the password. (iii) If the Affiliate loses its password or if there is a possibility that an unauthorized party has learned the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall immediately report this to element 5, which can then block access by the Affiliate to the Control Panel. All actions carried out with the user ID and password will be attributed to the Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "The Affiliate should endeavor to take steps to prevent unauthorized parties from learning the password. (iii) If the Affiliate loses its password or if there is a possibility that an unauthorized party has learned the user ID and password, the Affiliate may report this to element 5, which might then block access by the Affiliate to the Control Panel. Actions carried out with the user ID and password may be attributed to the Affiliate at element 5's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall take due care' to 'should endeavor to take steps' weakens the obligation to protect the password. 'Shall immediately report' is changed to 'may report,' making reporting of a security breach optional rather than mandatory. 'Will be attributed' is replaced with 'may be attributed at element 5's discretion,' giving element 5 the discretion to decide whether or not to hold the affiliate responsible for actions taken with their credentials. This contradicts generally accepted data security practices and principles enshrined in data protection laws like GDPR (if applicable, given element 5's location in Germany) which require reasonable and appropriate security measures and prompt notification of breaches.",
                "contradicted_law": "GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) - Article 32 (Security of processing) and Article 33 (Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority). Though this contract may predate GDPR, given element 5's location in Germany, GDPR principles regarding data security are relevant.",

                "original_text": "9.  LICENSES\n9.1 The Group shall, and Online BVI shall cause the Group to, use its reasonable endeavours to obtain from the applicable PRC regulatory authorities such licenses as are necessary for the operation of their respective businesses in the PRC (“Operating Licenses”).",

                "explanation": "The original text places a clear obligation on the Group and Online BVI to obtain necessary licenses. The modified version weakens this obligation by replacing 'shall' with 'should' and 'use its reasonable endeavors' with 'encourage the Group to, use its best efforts to seek guidance.' This makes the licensing requirement less definitive. The original text requires the group to acquire what's 'necessary' whereas the modified text has them 'seeking guidance from PRC authorities' regarding what's 'potentially relevant,' which is weaker language. This could conflict with PRC regulations that mandate specific licenses for certain business operations, making it difficult to determine if the parties are truly meeting their legal obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various PRC regulations requiring specific business licenses for operation within the PRC, such as regulations concerning internet content providers, telecommunications services, etc. These laws require definitive licensing, not merely seeking guidance.",

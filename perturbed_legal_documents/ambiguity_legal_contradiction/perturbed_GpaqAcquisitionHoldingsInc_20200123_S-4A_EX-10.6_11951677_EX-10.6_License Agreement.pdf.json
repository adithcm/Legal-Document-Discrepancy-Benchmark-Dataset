                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to be in material compliance' with 'agrees to endeavor to comply' and 'obtain and maintain' with 'make efforts to obtain and maintain' weakens the obligation. Endeavor and Efforts are ambiguous and do not guarantee actual compliance. This contradicts Ohio's legal system which demands definitive adherence to laws and regulations, especially concerning business operations and licensing. Ohio Revised Code sections related to business licensing and operational compliance require clear and demonstrable adherence, not merely an attempt.",

The modified text replaces \"bear the responsibility for the Station's compliance\" with \"endeavor to ensure the Station's general alignment.\" This weakens the obligation to a mere effort to align with FCC rules, creating ambiguity as to the level of compliance required. The term \"general alignment\" is vague and does not guarantee full adherence to all applicable rules and policies.",

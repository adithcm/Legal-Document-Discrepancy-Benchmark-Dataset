                "explanation": "The original clause mandates binding arbitration according to specific AAA rules in San Diego County, CA. The modified clause replaces 'shall' with 'may,' making arbitration optional. It also substitutes specific AAA rules with vague 'internationally recognized principles of fair dispute resolution' and adds 'where practicable,' creating significant ambiguity. This undermines the enforceability of arbitration. California law favors binding arbitration agreements, and this change could be seen as an attempt to avoid that requirement.",

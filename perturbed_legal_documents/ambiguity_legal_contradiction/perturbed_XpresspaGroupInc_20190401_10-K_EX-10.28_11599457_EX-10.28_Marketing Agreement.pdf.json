                "original_text": "5.01. With respect to any and all Stores owned or operated by XSPA, as between Calm and XSPA, XSPA shall be the sole owner and operator of any and all such Stores throughout the Territory and XSPA shall have sole management and operational control and liability with respect to such Stores and any and all costs and expense associated with the operation and maintenance thereof. XSPA shall operate and maintain the Stores with high standards of quality and service and shall at all times comply with any and all applicable laws in connection therewith.",
                "changed_text": "5.01. With respect to any and all Stores owned or operated by XSPA, as between Calm and XSPA, XSPA shall be the sole owner and operator of any and all such Stores throughout the Territory and XSPA shall have sole management and operational control and liability with respect to such Stores and any and all costs and expense associated with the operation and maintenance thereof. XSPA shall endeavor to operate and maintain the Stores with reasonable standards of quality and service and shall generally comply with applicable laws in connection therewith.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'high standards of quality and service' with 'reasonable standards of quality and service,' introducing ambiguity and lowering the expectation for store maintenance. Furthermore, replacing 'shall at all times comply' with 'shall generally comply' weakens the obligation to comply with all applicable laws. This creates uncertainty about XSPA's commitment to full legal compliance. The clause now permits subjective interpretation of what constitutes 'reasonable' standards and 'general' compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws, including health and safety regulations, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), mandate specific, non-discretionary standards for accessibility, maintenance, and service quality. This ambiguous wording could allow XSPA to skirt their responsibilities under these laws by claiming that their 'reasonable efforts' are sufficient, even if they don't meet the legal minimum requirements.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall' with 'should endeavor to,' 'meet' with 'generally meet,' 'in accordance with' to 'with consideration for', 'not be' to 'avoid being,' and 'have been approved' to 'aim to be approved'. This creates ambiguity and makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This directly contradicts the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which requires strict adherence to GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) and other regulatory requirements to ensure product safety and efficacy.",

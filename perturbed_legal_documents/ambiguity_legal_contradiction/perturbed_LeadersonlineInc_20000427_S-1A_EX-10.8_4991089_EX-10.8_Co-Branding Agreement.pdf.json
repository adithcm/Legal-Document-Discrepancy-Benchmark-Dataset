                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall comply with all prevailing\nlaws, rules and regulations and obtain all necessary approvals, consents and\npermits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the\njurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall endeavor to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and seek to obtain approvals, consents and permits as it deems reasonably necessary for its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply' and 'obtain all necessary' with 'seek to obtain ... as it deems reasonably necessary' weakens the obligation. This introduces ambiguity and allows each party to subjectively determine what is 'reasonably necessary,' potentially leading to non-compliance with mandatory legal requirements. The original text ensures strict adherence to the laws of the jurisdictions the company operates in. This change permits a weaker standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and state laws regarding business operations, including but not limited to environmental regulations (e.g., Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act), labor laws (e.g., Fair Labor Standards Act), and securities laws. In Pennsylvania, where VerticalNet is located, this could specifically relate to compliance with environmental regulations or worker safety standards mandated by the state. California, where LeadersOnline is located, has even stricter laws regarding business operations that need to be strictly adhered to, like the California Consumer Privacy Act.",

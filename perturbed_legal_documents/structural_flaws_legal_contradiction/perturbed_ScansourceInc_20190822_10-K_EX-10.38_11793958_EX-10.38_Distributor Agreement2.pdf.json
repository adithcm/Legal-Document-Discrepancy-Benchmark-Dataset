EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THIS WARRANTY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY CISCO, ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS. TO THE EXTENT AN IMPLIED WARRANTY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY. THIS WARRANTY GIVES CUSTOMER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND CUSTOMER MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH\nVARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. This disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty set forth above fails of its\nessential purpose.",
                "changed_text": "Customer Records. Customer grants to Cisco and its independent accountants the right to examine Customer's books, records and accounts\nduring Customer's normal business hours to verify compliance with this Agreement. In the event such audit discloses non-compliance with this\nAgreement, Customer shall promptly pay to Cisco the appropriate license fees.\n\nDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY: Cisco may, at its sole discretion, provide support, but this does not constitute a warranty. Customer acknowledges that all software is provided AS IS.",
                "explanation": "The original disclaimer of warranty is crucial in defining the limits of Cisco's responsibility. By moving a highly simplified and weakened version of the disclaimer of warranty to the 'Customer Records' section, it becomes less visible and less impactful. The original, comprehensive disclaimer is effectively removed, making it difficult for the customer to fully understand their rights and the limits of Cisco's liability. This relocation obscures a key legal protection for Cisco.",

Any controversy or claim between the parties concerning\nany breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance\nof any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation\nwill be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION] and the\nthen-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration\nAssociation (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION] is held to be\nunenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to\narbitrate or any other part of this Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION]. The arbitration will be held\nbefore a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business\ninformation and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes.\nThe arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the parties hereto within 30 days\nfollowing the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the parties are\nunable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be\ninstructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's\naward will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having\njurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or\nexemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage\nlimitations expressed in this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to the 'Miscellaneous' section makes it less prominent and harder to find. The removal of the phrase 'binding arbitration under this Section 6.2' makes it more difficult to enforce, because it can be argued that the method of arbitration does not apply, since it is not clearly stated.",

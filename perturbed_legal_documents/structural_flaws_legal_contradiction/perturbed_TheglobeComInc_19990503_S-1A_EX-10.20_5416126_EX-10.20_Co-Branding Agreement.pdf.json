                "explanation": "Moving the clause concerning compliance with laws to the severability section buries it within boilerplate language, making it less prominent and harder to enforce. This weakens the explicit requirement for Boxlot to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations, as it is no longer clearly highlighted as a distinct obligation.",

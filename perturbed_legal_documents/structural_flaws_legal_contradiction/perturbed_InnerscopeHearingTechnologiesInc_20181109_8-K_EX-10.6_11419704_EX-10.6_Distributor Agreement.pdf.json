In the event the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute, the arbitrator will determine the manner in which the parties are to pay the costs of such arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees",
                "explanation": "The deletion of the binding arbitration clause introduces contradictionâ€”the original clause stated arbitration for settlement. Removing this clause can allow one party to litigate rather than arbitrate. This contradicts the original clause's strict arbitration requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. The clause has been moved from 'General Provisions' to 'Obligations of Distributor'.",

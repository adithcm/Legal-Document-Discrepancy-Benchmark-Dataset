MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS\n\nDispute Resolution: In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Addendum, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation, either party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall take place in Greenville, South Carolina. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses of arbitration, and the parties shall share equally the costs and expenses of the arbitrator.",
                "explanation": "The dispute resolution clause, originally placed in a standard 'Governing Law and Dispute Resolution' section, has been moved to a newly created 'Marketing and Promotions' section. This misplacement makes it less likely that a party would readily find the dispute resolution terms, potentially hindering their understanding of their legal rights and obligations under the agreement. The inclusion of specific arbitration rules and location could be viewed as less enforceable if not prominently disclosed.",

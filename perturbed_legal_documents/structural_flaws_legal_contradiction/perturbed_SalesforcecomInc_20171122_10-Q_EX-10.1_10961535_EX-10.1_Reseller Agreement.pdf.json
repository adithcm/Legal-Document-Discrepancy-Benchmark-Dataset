                "explanation": "By placing the clause stating Sub-Reseller is not a third-party beneficiary at the beginning of the section and separated from the other clauses concerning Reseller's responsibilities for Sub-Reseller's compliance, the clause's significance is diminished. This could obscure the important detail that the Sub-Reseller has limited rights to enforce the contract directly against Salesforce, reducing clarity.",

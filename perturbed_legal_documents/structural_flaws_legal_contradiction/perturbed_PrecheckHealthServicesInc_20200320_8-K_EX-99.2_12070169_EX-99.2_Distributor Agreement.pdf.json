                "explanation": "The governing law clause, which specifies that Texas law applies, is moved to be embedded within a clause about official communications, making it less prominent and easily overlooked. This makes it harder for a party to quickly and definitively determine the jurisdiction governing the contract, potentially leading to disputes over which laws apply. Repeated clauses also introduce potential ambiguities.",

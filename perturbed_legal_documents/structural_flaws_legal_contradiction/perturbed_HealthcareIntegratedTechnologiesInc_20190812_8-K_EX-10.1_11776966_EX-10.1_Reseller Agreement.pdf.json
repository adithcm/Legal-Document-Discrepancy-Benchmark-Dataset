                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and all disputes and controversies arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be brought exclusively before the competent courts in New York County, New York; provided however that judgment shall be enforceable in any country and that nothing in this Section shall prevent or restrict either Party from seeking interim relief in any competent jurisdiction as it may deem fit.",
                "changed_text": "Each of Reseller and Supplier will, respectively, ensure that it and its employees, agents or affiliates, or by any independent contractors on its behalf or for its benefit, shall comply with the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 et seq.) and any analogous anti-bribery and anti-corruption law, rule, regulation that may apply to any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including but not limited to in connection with the sale, resale, import, export, transportation, or shipment of the Products. Neither party to this Agreement will make any payment, directly or indirectly, of money or other assets, including but not limited to compensation derived from this Agreement or any Order placed under it, to government or political party officials, officials of international organizations, candidates for public office, or representatives of other businesses or persons acting on behalf of any of the foregoing, that would constitute a violation of any law, rule, or regulation. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and all disputes and controversies arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be brought exclusively before the competent courts in New York County, New York; provided however that judgment shall be enforceable in any country and that nothing in this Section shall prevent or restrict either Party from seeking interim relief in any competent jurisdiction as it may deem fit.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause is moved into the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act section, making it less visible. This could be problematic if a dispute arises and a party argues they were not aware the contract was governed by New York law, especially if they are located in a different jurisdiction. It creates enforceability problems by obscuring a key legal aspect of the contract.",

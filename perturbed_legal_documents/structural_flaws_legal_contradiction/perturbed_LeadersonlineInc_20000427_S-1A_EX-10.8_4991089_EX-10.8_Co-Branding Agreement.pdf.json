This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.  Subject to the provisions of Section 8, both Parties consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the United States District Courts and the state courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in and for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania",

                "explanation": "The governing law clause, which specifies Pennsylvania law, is moved to define how word definitions should be interpreted. This misdirection makes it difficult to determine which jurisdiction's laws govern the contract, particularly as the original wording has been obfuscated. This shift violates generally accepted contract law principles, which require clarity in defining the legal jurisdiction governing the contract, and may result in the contract being unenforceable. Also, the removal of the clause submitting both parties to the exclusive jurisdiction of Pennsylvania courts reduces the likelihood the contract will be enforced under Pennsylvania law.",

Any controversy or claim between the Parties\nconcerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or\nnonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved\nby negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION]\nand the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American\nArbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION] is held to\nbe unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to\narbitrate or any other part of this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION]. The arbitration will be held\nin Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is\nknowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in\nhandling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the\nParties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is\ninstituted. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such\n30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15\ndays thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be\nentered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power\nto award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess\nof, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability\nwill be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and\nprocedural laws relating to arbitrationÍ¾ in all other respects, the arbitrator\nwill be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania.",
                "changed_text": "16.17 ARBITRATION (Optional). Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement will be submitted to arbitration at the sole discretion of both parties. If both parties agree, arbitration will be conducted under the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). The arbitration will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the Parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be considered advisory and not binding, unless both parties agree in writing to be bound by the decision. Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance with the understanding of both parties, and the arbitrator will be obligated to consider the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as one factor, but not the sole determinant.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause mandates binding arbitration. The modified clause moves the arbitration clause to the 'Miscellaneous' section and redefines it as 'optional,' stating that arbitration only occurs if both parties agree. Furthermore, it weakens the clause by stating the arbitrator's award is only advisory, not binding, unless both parties agree in writing. This contradicts the original intent of mandatory and binding arbitration, making enforcement uncertain. By adding the term (Optional) makes the clause harder to find.",

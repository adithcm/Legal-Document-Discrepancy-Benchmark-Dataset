                "original_text": "15.      The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be\n         governed by the laws of the State of New York.",
                "changed_text": "13.      Neither Party shall be liable to the other for special, incidental, or\n         consequential damages, even if such Party has been advised of the\n         possibility of such damages.\n14.      This Agreement shall not be assigned by mPhase without the prior\n         written consent of Lucent.\n15.     In the event of a dispute relating to intellectual property, the laws of Delaware shall govern. For all other matters, the validity, construction, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.\n16.      This Agreement, including the Schedules and Addenda hereto, constitutes\n         the entire Agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter\n         hereof and supersedes all proposals, oral or written, all negotiations,\n         conversations, and/or discussions between the Parties relating to this\n         Agreement and all past courses of dealing or industry customs.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifying New York law as governing the entire agreement is modified to introduce an exception for intellectual property disputes, which are now governed by Delaware law. This creates a potential conflict of laws issue, especially if an intellectual property dispute overlaps with other contractual obligations. This weakens the enforceability of the governing law clause, as it's now unclear which state's laws apply in complex situations. The introduction of Delaware law in 15, creates a legal contradiction.",

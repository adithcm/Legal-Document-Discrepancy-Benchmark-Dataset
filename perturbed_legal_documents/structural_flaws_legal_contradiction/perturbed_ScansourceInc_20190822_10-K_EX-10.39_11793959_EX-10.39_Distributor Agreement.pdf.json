                "explanation": "The relocation of the FCPA compliance clause to a general statement about compliance with all laws weakens its emphasis and potential enforcement. It fails to explicitly highlight the importance of anti-corruption measures, making it less visible and potentially overlooked. The specific link to the Department of Justice website is removed, further obscuring the availability of compliance information.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from California to Delaware introduces a legal contradiction because both parties are Delaware corporations but operate primarily in California. This may lead to disputes over which state's laws apply, especially concerning consumer protection or data privacy, making enforcement more complex and potentially less favorable to consumers who might expect California law to govern.",

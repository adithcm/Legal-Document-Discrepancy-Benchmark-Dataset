All such arbitration proceedings shall be administered by the AAA and held\nin Dallas, Texas. The parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding as to each of them.

The arbitrator's fee shall be shared\nequally by the parties. The arbitrator's award may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Prior to invoking arbitration, the parties will\nmake a reasonable effort to settle any dispute in an informal and expeditious manner. The parties separately and specially agree that if either shall\ncontend that this Agreement is invalid or that grounds exist for its rescission or cancellation, that any dispute concerning such contention shall be\nsubmitted to arbitration in the manner provided in this section. Each party shall bear such party's own attorneys' fees in any arbitration proceeding;\nhowever, if either party commences an action in court to compel arbitration, enforce an arbitration award, or otherwise seek by judicial means to\nsecure compliance with the arbitration provisions of this Agreement, then the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party the\nprevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit incurred for such purpose.",

                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to the 'Headings' section, which is typically understood as a non-operative part of the contract addressing purely formatting and interpretation aids, significantly reduces the clause's enforceability. Courts may view the clause as a heading rather than an operative agreement to arbitrate, thus impacting its binding nature. Additionally, Texas law (specified in the contract's controlling law section, 15.1) generally requires arbitration agreements to be clear and conspicuous. Placing it under 'Headings' obscures its significance.",

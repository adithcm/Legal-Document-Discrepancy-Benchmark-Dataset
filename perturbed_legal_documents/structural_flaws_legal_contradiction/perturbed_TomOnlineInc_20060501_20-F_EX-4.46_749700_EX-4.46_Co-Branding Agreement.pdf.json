                "original_text": "14.2\tGoverning Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Subject to the parties’ rights to seek injunctive relief or other right in equity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the parties to this Agreement expressly understand and agree that any dispute arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the courts located in England and Wales and the parties to this Agreement hereby consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue therein.",
                "changed_text": "1.57 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, but either party can elect arbitration. Subject to the parties’ rights to seek injunctive relief or other right in equity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the parties to this Agreement understand and agree that any dispute arising under this Agreement will be brought in the court determined by the party initiating the claim.",
                "explanation": "I have moved the governing law clause, which specifies that any disputes will be settled in the courts of England and Wales, to the 'Definitions' section where legal disputes would not normally be addressed. I've modified the clause to permit either party to elect arbitration. This reduces its clarity and enforceability by making it harder to locate and interpret. It also creates a contradiction by specifying English law but also allowing for a choice of court by the initiating party, which could be a court in a different jurisdiction.",

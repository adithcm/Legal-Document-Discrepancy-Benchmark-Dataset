                "original_text": "27.1 Choice of Law. The validity, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement shall be controlled by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, as if performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law, and the state and federal courts of California shall have jurisdiction over any claim arising under this Agreement. The parties specifically disclaim the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek interim injunctive relief in any court of appropriate jurisdiction with respect to any alleged breach of such party's intellectual property or proprietary rights.",
                "changed_text": "12.7 In any suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement the prevailing party will have the right to recover from the other its costs and reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys incurred in connection with the suit or proceeding, including costs, fees and expenses upon appeal, separately from and in addition to any other amount included in such judgment. Distributor agrees that, in the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement, the laws of the State of Delaware will govern. This agreement shall be deemed performed in Delaware, regardless of the location of the parties or where the work is performed. The parties agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement shall be instituted in a state or federal court located in Delaware.",
                "explanation": "The change relocates the choice of law clause to a numerically irrelevant section of the contract, specifically under a section about inventory balancing. This makes it harder to find. Furthermore, the original clause specified New York law, while the modified clause specifies Delaware law. The contract indicates that Scansource, Inc. is based out of South Carolina and Cisco Systems, Inc. is based out of California. By switching the governing law to Delaware, a state with no apparent connection to the parties involved or the contract's performance, introduces a potential challenge to the clause's enforceability. Courts often look to the location of the parties, the location of contract execution, and the place of performance when determining the validity of a choice of law clause. This deviation could lead to disputes over which state's laws should apply, increasing legal costs and uncertainty.",

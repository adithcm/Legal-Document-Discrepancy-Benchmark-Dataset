                "explanation": "The term \"Infringement Claim\" is replaced with \"Intellectual Property Dispute\" in the first sentence. Later in the same paragraph, the text reverts to using the original term, \"Infringement Claim.\" This creates confusion as it is unclear if the terms are interchangeable, if \"Intellectual Property Dispute\" is a broader or narrower category, and which term applies to PAPA JOHN'S obligations.",

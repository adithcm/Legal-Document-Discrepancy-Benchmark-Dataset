                "explanation": "Changing 'Affiliate' to 'Sub-Affiliate' in the first line of section 1.04 introduces a contradiction. The contract doesn't define 'Sub-Affiliate', creating confusion about whether a separate entity or the original Affiliate is responsible for the described obligations. It's unclear whether the Sub-Affiliate is also subject to all the obligations assigned to the 'Affiliate' throughout the rest of the document. This creates potential ambiguities about liability and enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'CLIENT' to 'A different entity' introduces ambiguity about which entity possesses the right to withdraw Merchants. The contract does not define \"a different entity\" or \"this other organization\", and there is no clarification on whether it is an affiliated entity or a completely separate entity. This undefined terminology contrasts with the defined term 'Affiliate' and leaves the reader unsure whom to hold accountable for fulfilling obligations associated with withdrawing merchants.",

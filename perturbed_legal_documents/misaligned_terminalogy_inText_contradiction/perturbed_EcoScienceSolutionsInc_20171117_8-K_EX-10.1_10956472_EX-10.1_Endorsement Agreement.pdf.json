These terms are used interchangeably without definition, potentially causing confusion about the exact responsibilities of Talent. A Spokesperson might have different public representation duties compared to a Brand Advocate, creating an internal contradiction.",

The monthly Social Communication schedule will be mutually agreed upon by Talent and ESSI one month in advance of the actual month of communications. Once the monthly Social Communication schedule is set, the volume of Posts, Tweets and Snaps will determine the total amount of monthly compensation available to Talent.

                "explanation": "Several terms have been altered here without definition.  'Social Communication' becomes 'Digital Outreach'. 'Social Media Manager' becomes 'Marketing Lead', and 'Company Quarter' becomes 'fiscal year.' This introduces ambiguity about the specific responsibilities and metrics used for compensation. Does 'digital presence' entail more than just social communication? Is a 'Marketing Lead' equivalent to a 'Social Media Manager' in scope? Is a company's 'fiscal year' identical to 'Company quarter'?",

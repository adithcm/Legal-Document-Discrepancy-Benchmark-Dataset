                "explanation": "The term 'Station' is a defined term, whereas 'Broadcast Center' is an undefined term, and changes the level of requirements of the contract. It creates a discrepancy, because the 'Station' was already established as a defined term, with specific obligations listed in the contract, but it is unclear if a Broadcast Center is the same entity and is, therefore, held to the same responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Station' is a defined term, whereas 'Broadcast Outlet' is an undefined term.  This creates confusion as it is uncertain if \"Broadcast Outlet\" refers to the same entity as \"Station,\" which is used elsewhere in the contract.  Since it's undefined, there is an internal confusion about whether it is indeed the same, and also whether the existing obligations for 'Stations' apply to the newly termed 'Broadcast Outlet.'",

If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member’s fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Society' is now being used interchangeably with 'Thrivent', even though the 'Society' has a specific definition as 'Thrivent Financial for Lutherans' in the definition section. This creates confusion as to whether the 'Society' refers to the entire organization or just the benefits aspect. This could cause confusion on which entity's solvency is at risk and therefore who will make an extra payment.",

Changing 'our bylaws' to 'Thrivent's regulations' creates confusion about what 'Thrivent' refers to. It is unclear if 'Thrivent's regulations' mean bylaws, internal policies, or state-level regulations, making assignment enforcement difficult.",

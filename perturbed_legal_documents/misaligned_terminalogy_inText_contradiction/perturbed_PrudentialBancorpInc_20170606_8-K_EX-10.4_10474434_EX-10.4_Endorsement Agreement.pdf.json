                "explanation": "Changing 'Employer' to 'Company' in the opening paragraph, while keeping 'Employer' in later sections, creates ambiguity as to which entity is bound by the obligations outlined in the contract. It is not defined if the 'Company' and 'Employer' are to be considered the same entity. This raises concerns about whether Prudential Bank or another entity is responsible for managing and overseeing the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Referencing 'Employer's board of directors' while replacing 'Employer' with 'Prudential Bank' as the Named Fiduciary and Plan Administrator creates confusion. The term 'Bank' is used within this article, but there is reference to the 'Employer's board of directors', suggesting a disconnect between entity and plan. It is unclear whether the Employer's board of directors has authority over the Prudential Bank, leading to uncertainty regarding who is responsible for the plan's administration.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Product' has been replaced with 'Goods' in Section 2. 'Product' is explicitly defined in Section 1 of the contract whereas 'Goods' is not defined anywhere in the agreement. This creates an internal contradiction as it is now unclear if 'Goods' refers to the same items as 'Product', creating confusion regarding the scope of the license granted and the obligations of the parties.",

This creates a contradiction because 'Product' is a defined term, and it is unclear whether 'Items' has the same meaning or includes other things. This affects the rights and responsibilities of the Talent to compensation related to the sale of 'Items' following termination.",

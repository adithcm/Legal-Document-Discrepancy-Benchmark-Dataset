                "explanation": "By omitting 'substantive laws of the State of New York', the governing law becomes ambiguous. This introduces legal risk because New York law provides certain consumer protections and business regulations. Removing the explicit reference allows for potential misinterpretations and may permit actions that would be illegal under New York law, since the contract can be interpreted under less strict, more permissive or ambiguous legal framework.",

The place of jurisdiction for all claims arising in connection with this business relationship is Cologne, Germany.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the clause specifying German law as the applicable law for foreign affiliates, creating uncertainty and potentially contradicting consumer protection laws in the affiliate's country of origin. For example, if a US-based affiliate has a dispute, removing the specification of German law could imply that US law applies, but the jurisdiction clause still points to Cologne, Germany for dispute resolution, potentially violating US consumer rights regarding access to courts and applicable consumer protection regulations.",

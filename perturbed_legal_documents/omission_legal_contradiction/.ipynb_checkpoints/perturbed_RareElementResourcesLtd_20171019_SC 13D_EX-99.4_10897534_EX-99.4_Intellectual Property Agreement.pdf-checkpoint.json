                "original_text": "3.09 Company represents that to the best of its knowledge, the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, will be free from claims of infringement of the patents and copyrights of any Third Party. Company further represents that it has not received any written notice of a claim and otherwise has no knowledge that the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, violate or infringe upon the rights of any Person. Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Investor, Investors’ Affiliates, and their officers and directors, and their direct and indirect customers, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, diminution in value, deficiencies, actions, proceedings, taxes, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of investigation as incurred, arising out of or relating to any breach of any of the representations made in this Article 3.09.",
                "changed_text": "3.09 Company represents that it has not received any written notice of a claim and otherwise has no knowledge that the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, violate or infringe upon the rights of any Person. Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Investor, Investors’ Affiliates, and their officers and directors, and their direct and indirect customers from and against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages arising out of or relating to any breach of any of the representations made in this Article 3.09.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the representation regarding freedom from infringement claims significantly reduces the Company's liability and weakens the protection afforded to the Investor. By removing 'to the best of its knowledge, the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, will be free from claims of infringement of the patents and copyrights of any Third Party' and 'to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, diminution in value, deficiencies, actions, proceedings, taxes, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of investigation as incurred' from the original text, the contract introduces a legal contradiction. California law implies a warranty of non-infringement in sales contracts, as detailed in Cal. Com. Code § 2312, which the original clause aimed to reinforce. Removing this guarantee and limiting the scope of indemnification undermines this protection, creating a potential violation of California commercial law. The company is no longer promising the products are free from infringing on the patents of other parties.",

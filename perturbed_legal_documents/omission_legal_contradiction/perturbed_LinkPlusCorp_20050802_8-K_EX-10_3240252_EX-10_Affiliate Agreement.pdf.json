                "explanation": "The removal of the jury trial waiver clause introduces a legal contradiction. Under Maryland law, the right to a jury trial is constitutionally protected. While a party can knowingly and voluntarily waive this right, its explicit removal from the contract potentially leads to disputes about whether the waiver was indeed knowing and voluntary. Furthermore, some jurisdictions require specific language or a separate, signed agreement for a jury trial waiver to be enforceable, making this omission legally risky. The original clause was an attempt to create such a waiver. Removing it entirely means the contract doesn't address jury trials, increasing the risk of facing one.",

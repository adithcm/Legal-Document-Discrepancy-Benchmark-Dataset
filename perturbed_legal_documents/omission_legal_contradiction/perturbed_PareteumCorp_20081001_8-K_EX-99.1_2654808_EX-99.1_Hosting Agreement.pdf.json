                "explanation": "This change weakens the consumer data privacy clause, which is a violation of consumer rights. By adding 'commercially reasonable efforts' and removing specific mention of the 'Dutch Data Protection Act', the contract introduces ambiguity and allows T-Mobile more leeway in processing personal data, against consumer protection laws like GDPR which are applicable in the EU and Netherlands.",

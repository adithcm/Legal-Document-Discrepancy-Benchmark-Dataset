                "original_text": "Each Party shall comply with all prevailing laws, rules and regulations and obtain all necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the jurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall endeavor to comply with the major laws that directly affect this agreement to the best of their ability and obtain approvals, consents and permits.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates strict compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations. This has been weakened to 'endeavor to comply with the major laws' and replaces 'shall' with 'to the best of their ability,' which creates a loophole. This omission introduces legal risk because strict compliance is often legally required, and the modified language provides an avenue to avoid compliance with specific laws by arguing inability or minor relevance. It creates a legal contradiction as certain laws may require mandatory compliance, not just an effort to comply.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring good faith and adherence to applicable laws and regulations; specific industry regulations that mandate certain compliance measures.",

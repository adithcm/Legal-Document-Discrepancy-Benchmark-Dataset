                "original_text": "Company, either directly or through its authorized service provider, shall provide customer service (the “Customer Service”) relating to Client Website consisting of replying to customer questions or complaints regarding website hosting services during the normal business hours set forth. Company is not obligated to provide any Customer Service except as specified in this Section. Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.",

Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.",
                "explanation": "By removing the obligation for the Company to provide customer service, and changing 'shall' to 'may' we introduce a legal risk. Many jurisdictions, including some states in the US, have consumer protection laws that mandate a certain level of customer support for ongoing services like website hosting. Eliminating the requirement to provide 'Customer Service' and making it purely discretionary could violate these laws, as it leaves the consumer without a guaranteed avenue for resolving issues related to the website hosting services.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates consumer protection laws in jurisdictions requiring minimum customer service standards for ongoing services.",

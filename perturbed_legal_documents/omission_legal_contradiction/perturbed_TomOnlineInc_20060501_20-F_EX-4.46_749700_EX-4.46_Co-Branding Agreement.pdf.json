This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Subject to the partiesâ€™ rights to seek injunctive relief or other right in equity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the parties to this Agreement expressly understand and agree that any dispute arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the courts located in England and Wales and the parties to this Agreement hereby consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue therein.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause that disputes will be brought exclusively in the courts located in England and Wales, and removing consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue therein, may violate consumer protection laws. If the contract is used to target consumers in the United States, it must adhere to US laws regarding dispute resolution, potentially including provisions for arbitration or small claims court, which are consumer rights. By omitting the jurisdiction clause, the contract makes it difficult for consumers outside of England and Wales to enforce their rights.",

                "original_text": "Any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including to its execution, performance or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of any state or federal court sitting in New York City in the State of New York over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it shall not assert and shall hereby waive any claim or right or defense that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any legal proceeding resolved in accordance with this Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06 shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.",
                "changed_text": "Any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including to its execution, performance or enforcement, shall be subject to arbitration at a venue of Honeywell's choosing. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any legal proceeding resolved in accordance with this Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06 shall be non-conclusive and may not be enforced in other jurisdictions.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specification of New York law and exclusive jurisdiction in New York courts, and replacing it with mandatory arbitration at Honeywell's chosen venue, deprives SpinCo of the right to litigate in a public court and may violate due process rights depending on the arbitration terms. Making the judgment non-conclusive also significantly undermines enforcement options.",
                "contradicted_law": "Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which guarantees the right to a fair legal process.",

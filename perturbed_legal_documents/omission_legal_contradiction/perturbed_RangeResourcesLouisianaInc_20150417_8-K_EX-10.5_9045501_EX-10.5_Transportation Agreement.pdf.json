                "original_text": "18.\tCLAIMS, SUITS, AND TIME FOR FILING:\nAs a condition precedent to recovery by Shipper for loss, damage, or delay in receipt or delivery of Shipper’s Products for which Carrier may be responsible, Shipper’s claim must be filed in writing with Carrier within nine (9) months after delivery of the affected Products, or, in case of Carrier’s failure to make delivery of Shipper’s Products, then within nine (9) months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits shall be instituted against Carrier only within two (2) years and one (1) day from the day when notice in writing is given by Carrier to Shipper that Carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted by Shipper on such claims in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such claims will not be paid and Carrier will not be liable.",

Carrier's decision on the outcome of the claim is final.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the legally required timeframes for filing claims and instituting suits against the carrier, and gives the carrier ultimate discretion. This contradicts consumer protection laws that ensure fair and reasonable processes for claims.",

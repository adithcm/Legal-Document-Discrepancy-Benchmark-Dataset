                "explanation": "The modification limits the liability waiver to exclude damages arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct. In New York, while parties can contractually limit liability, such limitations are generally unenforceable for gross negligence or intentional misconduct. Omitting the mention that gross negligence is excluded creates a legal contradiction, as it implies a broader waiver than is legally permissible, potentially misleading a party into thinking they have waived rights that cannot be waived under New York law.",
                "contradicted_law": "New York law regarding the enforceability of exculpatory clauses and limitations of liability, particularly the restrictions on waiving liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct. While there's no specific statute cited, case law establishes this principle.",

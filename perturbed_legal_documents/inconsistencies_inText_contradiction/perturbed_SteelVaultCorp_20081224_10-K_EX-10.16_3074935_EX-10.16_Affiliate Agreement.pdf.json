                "original_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall pay to Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in Exhibit A attached hereto. Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in full by Marketing Affiliate 30 days from the invoice date.",
                "changed_text": "Marketing Affiliate shall pay to Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in Exhibit A attached hereto. Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in full by Marketing Affiliate 60 days from the invoice date, unless otherwise specified in writing by Equidata.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict with the later clause that states a late charge of 1 1/2% per month will be applied to unpaid amounts. The 'unless otherwise specified in writing by Equidata' part creates ambiguity. While the original clause provides a clear 30-day payment window, this change introduces a potential for Equidata to demand payment sooner via written notice, conflicting with both the original 30-day term and the late fee clause if enforced before 60 days. This makes enforcement unpredictable.",

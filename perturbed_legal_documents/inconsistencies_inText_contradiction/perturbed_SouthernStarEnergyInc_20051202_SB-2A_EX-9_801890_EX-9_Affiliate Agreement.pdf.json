If this is not\nthe case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100\nEUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the\nAffiliate's participation in the Program.",
                "changed_text": "(6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur quarterly\ninsofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not\nthe case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100\nEUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the\nAffiliate's participation in the Program. However, element 5 reserves the right to delay any and all payments for up to 180 days for any reason.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states payments are made monthly if exceeding a certain threshold. The modified clause changes this to quarterly, creating a direct contradiction. Furthermore, the addition of allowing payment delays of up to 180 days introduces uncertainty, as it conflicts with the quarterly payment schedule, making enforcement unclear: are they quarterly, or can they be delayed significantly?",

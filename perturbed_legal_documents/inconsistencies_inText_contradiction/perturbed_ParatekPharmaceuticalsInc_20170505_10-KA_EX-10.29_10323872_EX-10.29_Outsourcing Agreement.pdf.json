However, payment terms may be extended to [* * *] with prior written approval from Supplier.\nAll payments will be made in U.S. Dollars by SWIFT bank transfer directly to the Supplier account as specified in the respective Purchase Orders.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. Initially, invoices are to be paid within [* * *]. The modified section introduces an exception allowing payment within [* * *] with the Supplier's written approval. This creates ambiguity about which payment term takes precedence without clarifying the conditions for the extension, potentially leading to disputes over late payment penalties and obligations.",

Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid.

Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid.

                "explanation": "The original text states that if the Customer fails to pay undisputed amounts and does not cure the failure within ten (10) calendar days of written notice from Transporter, then the Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of gas. The modified text changes the cure period from ten (10) calendar days to thirty (30) calendar days. This creates an inconsistency in the enforcement of payment terms as it is unclear whether the cure period is ten (10) days or thirty (30) days, causing uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that late payments will accrue interest after 30 days past the due date. The modified text changes this to 60 days. Section 3.5.1 states that payments are due within 45 days of the quarter's end. The amended Section 3.5.2 implies interest accrues only after 60 days beyond the due date (45 days), effectively giving a 105-day grace period before interest applies. This creates a contradiction and enforcement uncertainty: Is interest triggered after 30 days post due date, or 60 days post due date?",

                "original_text": "2.Payment. The Affiliate Advertising Share, if any, shall be payable quarterly and shall be due no later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each calendar quarter for which a payment is due. If this Agreement is terminated during a calendar quarter, the amount payable shall be determined as of the termination date.",

The Affiliate Advertising Share, if any, shall be payable quarterly and shall be due no later than thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar quarter for which a payment is due. If this Agreement is terminated during a calendar quarter, the amount payable shall be determined as of the termination date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting payment deadlines. Exhibit D, Section I.2 now states that payment is due within 30 days of the end of each quarter, while Section 7(b) states that Network shall submit the quarterly statement within forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar quarter. It is unclear if the payment due date is dependent on the delivery of the statement or independent of it. Therefore, one section allows for 45 days for the report, but the other requires full payment 30 days after the end of the quarter. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as affiliate may demand payment 30 days after quarter-end, when the broadcaster has not delivered the statement.",

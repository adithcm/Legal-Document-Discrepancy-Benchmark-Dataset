Relationship Structure & Payment Schedule\nCompany agrees to pay to the Association the cash rights fee in the amount of $150,000 for this Sponsorship Agreement.\nPayments to Association shall be payable according to the following schedule:\nYear 1 - Due: December 31, 2018 - $50,000\nYear 2 - Due: December 31, 2019 - $75,000\nRemaining Balance Due: March 30, 2020 - $25,000\n\nNotwithstanding the above schedule, the Association reserves the right to demand immediate payment of the full outstanding balance at any time, subject to providing 5 business days written notice to the Company.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment schedule. While a specific payment schedule is outlined, a new clause grants the Association the right to demand immediate payment of the entire remaining balance with only 5 days' notice. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes as the Company may rely on the original schedule for budgeting and cash flow, but is now subject to immediate payment demands. This creates ambiguity regarding which payment terms should be enforced.",

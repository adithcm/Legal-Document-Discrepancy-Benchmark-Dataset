This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until either Party informs the other Party with thirty (30) day prior written notice of termination of this Agreement. However, UDC reserves the right to terminate this agreement with only ten (10) days written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. Section 5(a) originally stated that either party could terminate with thirty days' notice. The added sentence states that UDC can terminate with only ten days' notice. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty as to the actual termination notice period required by UDC.",

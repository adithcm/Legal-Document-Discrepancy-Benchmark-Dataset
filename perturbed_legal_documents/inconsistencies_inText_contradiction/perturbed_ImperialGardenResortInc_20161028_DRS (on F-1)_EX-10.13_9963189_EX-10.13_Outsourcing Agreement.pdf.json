                "explanation": "Article V initially outlines the payment stages, but doesn't specify a timeframe for Stage 1 payment *after* signing. By adding 'within 15 days', it sets a specific deadline for the initial payment. This conflicts with the last paragraph of Article V, which states 'In case the Contract cannot be performed due to any reason other than the architect herein, the client agrees the fees paid will not be refunded.' If the contract is terminated by the client 16 days after signing due to reasons unrelated to the architect and before Stage 2 milestones are achieved, it is unclear whether the client can claim the money back, because they have not met the Stage 1 condition, and the 'non-refundable' clause applies, creating a contradiction about whether a refund is due or not. This change introduces ambiguity about the refund policy in cases of early contract termination.",

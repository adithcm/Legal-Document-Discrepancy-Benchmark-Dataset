                "changed_text": "Payments for Products delivered in accordance with the Purchase Orders, and any other to be made by the Company to Suppliers hereunder, shall be made in the Applicable Currency within [***] from the shipment of the applicable Products delivered. However, all payments exceeding $1,000,000 USD are subject to a net 90 payment term, regardless of the standard payment terms. This extended payment term will be applied at the sole discretion of the Company, based on their current financial situation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting payment terms. The original clause specifies a payment timeframe of [***] from shipment. The added text introduces a new, longer payment term (90 days) for invoices exceeding a certain amount. Furthermore, it makes application of this extended term discretionary based on the Company's financial situation, making enforcement unpredictable and potentially causing disputes over when payments are actually due, creating uncertainty.",

Provisions governing a Rate other than the\nmaximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto.",

Provisions governing a Rate other than the\nmaximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto. All invoices are due and payable within 60 days of the invoice date.",
                "explanation": "Paragraph 9 specifies how rates are determined but doesn't define payment terms. By adding 'All invoices are due and payable within 60 days of the invoice date' to paragraph 9, we introduce a payment deadline. Then, in paragraph 12, we add another payment deadline that conflicts with paragraph 9.",

                "explanation": "Paragraph 12 incorporates the FERC Gas Tariff. By adding 'Payment for services rendered under this agreement is due within 30 days of invoice date' to paragraph 12, we introduce a payment deadline of 30 days. This conflicts with the 60-day payment deadline established in paragraph 9, creating ambiguity about when payment is actually due.

                "changed_text": "g. “Endorsed Product(s)” shall only mean and include Company’s irons, woods, wedges and putters. However, for the purposes of royalty calculations in Section 7, 'Endorsed Products' shall include all F2 branded apparel and accessories sold during the Contract Period.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Endorsed Products' is limited to golf clubs. The modification expands the definition in Section 7, specifically for royalty calculations, to include apparel and accessories. This creates a conflict, because now 'Endorsed Products' has two different meanings within the same agreement. This could lead to disputes about the royalty amounts due to North, as it's unclear whether sales of apparel and accessories should be included.",

                "explanation": "Section 5(e) originally requires \"reasonable efforts\" to mention the benefits of Company's products, offering some flexibility. The modified version creates a strict guarantee to exclusively promote the brand and to mention products at least 5 times per interview. This change introduces a significant contradiction. The original text only required a reasonable effort while the new version binds North to a specific action. This change creates an internal contradiction within the contract.",

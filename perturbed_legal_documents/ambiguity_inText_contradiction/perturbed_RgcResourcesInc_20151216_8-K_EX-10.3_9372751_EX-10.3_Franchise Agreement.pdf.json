                "original_text": "4. BUSINESS OFFICE. Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise maintain at least one business office within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per week for the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers.",
                "changed_text": "4. BUSINESS OFFICE. Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise maintain at least one business office within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per week for the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers.\n\nAlternatively, the Grantee may fulfill this requirement by maintaining a virtual office presence accessible by phone and email during normal business hours, Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays.",
                "explanation": "Section 4 initially mandates a physical business office open 40 hours a week. The added text introduces an alternative option: a virtual office. This creates a contradiction, as it's unclear if the Grantee *must* have a physical office or if a virtual presence is sufficient. This ambiguity affects the level of local economic presence and accessibility expected from the Grantee, potentially impacting the Town's ability to interact with the Grantee directly.",

                "explanation": "The original Section 6 stipulates that all notices must be delivered via certified mail or overnight courier. The added text introduces an exception: email is sufficient for 'routine operational matters.' This creates ambiguity because 'routine operational matters' is not defined. It is unclear which communications require formal delivery and which can be handled via email, potentially leading to disputes over whether proper notice was given, especially concerning important contractual matters.",

                "explanation": "The modified definition of “Trademarks” limits its scope to marks used on products directly related to the SpinCo Business. This creates a contradiction if, in another section (e.g., Section 4.01 regarding licenses from SpinCo to Honeywell), the term 'Trademarks' is used without this limitation, implying that the license covers all trademarks regardless of their connection to the SpinCo Business. This ambiguity can cause disputes over the scope of licensed trademarks.",

With regard",
                "explanation": "By changing 'have each obtained knowledge of and access to, or otherwise used' to 'may have incidentally obtained knowledge of and access to, or otherwise used', the agreement casts doubt on whether SpinCo legitimately accessed Honeywell IP, weakening SpinCo’s claim to the Honeywell Shared IP licenses granted later in the section. If Section 5.02 states no implied licenses, this uncertainty about SpinCo’s initial access conflicts with the intent to grant licenses for previously used IP. This internal contradiction makes it difficult to establish a clear understanding of the rights and obligations regarding Honeywell Shared IP.",

The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing\nannually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").\n\nHowever, notwithstanding the above, ESSI may terminate this agreement at any time, for any reason, with no prior notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the 'Term' definition. Initially, termination requires a 30-day notice from either party. The added clause grants ESSI the right to terminate the agreement at any time, without notice, creating ambiguity and uncertainty about the actual term and termination conditions. This could lead to disputes regarding the contract's enforceability and the obligations of Talent.",

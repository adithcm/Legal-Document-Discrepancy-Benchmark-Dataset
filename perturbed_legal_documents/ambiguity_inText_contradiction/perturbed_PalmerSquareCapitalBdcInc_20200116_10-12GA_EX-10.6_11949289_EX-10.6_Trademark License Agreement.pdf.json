Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee’s own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory without the prior express written consent of Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not use the Licensed Mark for any purpose outside the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",

All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Licensor's consent to use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory is at Licensor's 'sole and absolute discretion.' The modified text changes this to 'which shall not be unreasonably withheld.' This introduces a contradiction because another clause in the contract might rely on Licensor's 'sole and absolute discretion,' and the change implies a requirement for reasonable justification, creating uncertainty about Licensor's control over the mark's use.",

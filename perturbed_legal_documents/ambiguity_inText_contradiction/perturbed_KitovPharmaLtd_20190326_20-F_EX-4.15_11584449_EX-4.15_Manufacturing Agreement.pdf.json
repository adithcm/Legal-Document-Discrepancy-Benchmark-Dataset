                "original_text": "1.11 “Delivery” shall mean the time when the Product is placed at the disposal of Kitov at Dexcel’s Facility based on an **** (Incoterms® 2010).",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by creating two potential definitions for 'Delivery'. The primary definition refers to the product being available at Dexcel's facility, while the added clause allows for a different definition where 'Delivery' occurs upon arrival at Kitov's warehouse, subject to a separate written agreement. This could lead to disputes over responsibilities regarding shipping costs, insurance, and risk of loss during transit, as the location of 'Delivery' now varies based on an external and undefined agreement.",

                "changed_text": "1.35 “Specifications” shall mean the pharmacochemical, manufacturing, stability and other specifications of a Product defined in such Product’s Marketing Authorization as initially approved, and shall not be subject to change without Dexcel's explicit written consent, regardless of requirements from Health Authorities.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict in the definition of 'Specifications'. The original definition allows for changes to the specifications based on the requirements of Health Authorities. The modified definition prohibits any changes to the specifications as initially approved without Dexcel's written consent, regardless of the Health Authorities' requirements. This creates uncertainty in determining which specifications are binding, especially if a Health Authority mandates a change that Dexcel does not consent to. It directly contradicts the original allowance for changes to meet regulatory demands, leading to potential legal disputes.",

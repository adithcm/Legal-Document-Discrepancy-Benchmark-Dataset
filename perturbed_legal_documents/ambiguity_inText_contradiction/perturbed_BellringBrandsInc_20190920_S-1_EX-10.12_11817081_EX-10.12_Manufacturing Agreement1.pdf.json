                "original_text": "Heritage shall within [***] after the end of the production run, notify Premier via email of the final estimated production quantity and the estimated quantity, including losses, of all Premier-supplied materials used. If the final production quantity for any accepted PO is less than [***] of the PO quantity ordered, or if the quantity of production released for shipment within [***] from the last day of production is less than [***] of the PO quantity, upon request by Premier, Heritage shall take all commercially reasonable steps to produce or replace the shortfall within [***]. The final production quantity by Heritage and Jasper will count towards the MAOV requirements.",
                "changed_text": "Heritage shall within [***] after the end of the production run, notify Premier via email of the final estimated production quantity and the estimated quantity, including losses, of all Premier-supplied materials used. If the final production quantity for any accepted PO is less than [***] of the PO quantity ordered, or if the quantity of production released for shipment within [***] from the last day of production is less than [***] of the PO quantity, upon request by Premier, Heritage *may* take commercially reasonable steps to produce or replace the shortfall within [***], *contingent upon Heritage's then-current production schedule and material availability, as reasonably determined by Heritage*. The final production quantity by Heritage and Jasper will count towards the MAOV requirements.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Heritage \"shall take all commercially reasonable steps to produce or replace the shortfall.\" The modification changes this to \"Heritage *may* take commercially reasonable steps...,\" adding a contingency clause regarding schedule and material availability *as determined by Heritage*. This weakens Heritage's obligation and introduces ambiguity because if Heritage deems it commercially unreasonable due to their schedule, they may not be required to replace the shortfall. This contradicts the original intent of ensuring Premier receives the ordered quantity and introduces an in-text contradiction if other clauses rely on Heritage's obligation to meet the order quantity.",

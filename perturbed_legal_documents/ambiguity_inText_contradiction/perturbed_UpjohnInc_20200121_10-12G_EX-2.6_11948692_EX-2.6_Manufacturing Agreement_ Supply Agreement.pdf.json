Any Records that are financial in nature such as, but not limited to, time sheets, billing Records, invoices, payment applications, payments of consultants and subcontractors and receipts relating to reimbursable expenses shall be maintained in accordance with applicable Law in the jurisdiction in which the applicable Facility is located. Manufacturer shall maintain such Records for a period equal to the later of (x) three (3) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum, (y) the expiration of the statute of limitation for the Tax period applicable to such Records, or (z) for such period as otherwise may be required by applicable Law (the “Record Retention Period”).",

Any Records that are financial in nature such as, but not limited to, time sheets, billing Records, invoices, payment applications, payments of consultants and subcontractors and receipts relating to reimbursable expenses shall be maintained in accordance with applicable Law in the jurisdiction in which the applicable Facility is located. Manufacturer shall maintain such Records for a period equal to the earlier of (x) three (3) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum, (y) the expiration of the statute of limitation for the Tax period applicable to such Records, or (z) for such period as otherwise may be required by applicable Law (the “Record Retention Period”).",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that records will be maintained for the *later* of three defined periods, implying a potentially longer retention. The modified text changes this to the *earlier* of the three periods, which will result in the records being retained for the shortest time period. This contradiction introduces ambiguity, as it is unclear which retention period is correct.",

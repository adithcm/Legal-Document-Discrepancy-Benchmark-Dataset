                "original_text": "1.5 Operation of Smaaash Centres. Franchisee or third party sub –franchisees shall be under an obligation to set up at least 6 (six) Smaaash Centres during the first Contract Year or any other time period as may be provided by Franchisor.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 Operation of Smaaash Centres. Franchisee or third party sub –franchisees shall use their best efforts to set up a reasonable number of Smaaash Centres, not to exceed 3, during the first Contract Year.  The Franchisor and Franchisee will mutually determine the definition of 'reasonable number'.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates setting up at least 6 Smaaash Centres. The modified version introduces ambiguity by limiting the maximum number to 3 and replacing the 'obligation' with a 'best efforts' approach, and introducing an undefined term 'reasonable number.' This contradicts the initial clause, making the number of required centers uncertain and enforcement problematic. If the contract depends on a minimum number of locations to fulfill specific revenue or brand awareness targets, this change creates a significant point of contention.",

This Agreement may be terminated by either party for “Cause” without the need of providing a notice period prior to such termination becoming effective. “Cause” shall exist if circumstances occur which, taking into consideration the substance and purpose of this Agreement, would make it unreasonable for one or both of the parties to continue the contractual relationship and the other party fails to cure the cause (assuming that such cause is susceptible to cure) within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of a corresponding written notice (“Remedy Notice”). If such cause by its nature is not curable, then no such Remedy Notice is required. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a party may terminate this Agreement for “Cause”if:\n(a) the other party to this Agreement is in breach of one or more of its material obligations",
                "changed_text": "8.3 Termination for Cause. This Agreement may be terminated by either party for “Cause” with the provision of 90 days' written notice to the other party. \"Cause\" shall exist if circumstances occur which, taking into consideration the substance and purpose of this Agreement, would make it unreasonable for one or both of the parties to continue the contractual relationship. A Remedy Notice is required in all cases, regardless of curability, and the cure period shall be 60 days. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a party may terminate this Agreement for “Cause” if:\n(a) the other party to this Agreement is in breach of one or more of its material obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows immediate termination for cause without notice, but the modified version now requires 90 days' notice. Additionally, the original clause distinguishes between curable and non-curable causes regarding Remedy Notice requirements, whereas the modified clause mandates a Remedy Notice in all cases with a fixed 60-day cure period. This creates a direct contradiction regarding termination procedures, making it unclear when and how termination for cause can occur. One part of the agreement says no notice is needed and another part says that 90 days' notice is needed.",

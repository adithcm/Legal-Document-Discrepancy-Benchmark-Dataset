                "original_text": "Activated Users (as defined herein) through two distinct methods.\n\nMethod 1.\n(a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business \nname and address, telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with \nspecific groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member \ninformation, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a \nspecific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective user (“Seeded Profile”). As of \nthe date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers and associations to provide the basic business information for over \n6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo. For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an \n“Activated User.” \n\n(b). In order to activate a Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the \nNetwork, and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim the Seeded \nProfile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence has been completed by a \nuser, that user will be deemed to be an “Activated User” and the Network will identify that user as an Activated User.",

                "explanation": "The original text states \"a Seeded Profile is not an 'Activated User.'\" The modified text changes this to \"a Seeded Profile IS considered an 'Activated User.'\" This introduces a contradiction because the second half of the paragraph still describes the steps required to *become* an Activated User, implying that a Seeded Profile is not inherently activated. This would impact the royalty calculation, as it creates ambiguity as to whether royalties are owed on all Seeded Profiles, or only those that have completed the activation steps. This undermines the contract's enforcement regarding royalties.",

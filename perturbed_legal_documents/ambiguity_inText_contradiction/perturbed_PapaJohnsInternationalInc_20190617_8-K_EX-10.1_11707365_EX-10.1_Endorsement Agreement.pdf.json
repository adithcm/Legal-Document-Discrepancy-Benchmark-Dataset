                "original_text": "D.  Approval Standard. For purposes of this Agreement, “Approval” (and all grammatical variations thereof, e.g.,\nApprove, Approved, etc.) shall be defined as ABG’s prior written approval, which may be given or withheld in ABG’s sole discretion. ABG has the\nright to Approve all uses of the Celebrity Endorsement and the Personality Rights, whether by PAPA JOHN’S or any of its approved designees\n(including, without limitation, the use of the Personality Rights in connection with any and all Products and Materials. PAPA JOHN’S hereby agrees\nthat: (A) no Materials may be released or exhibited publicly, in any manner, unless and until ABG has Approved the same, (B) all Materials must be\nre-submitted for Approval each time a revision is made incorporating any changes, and (C) ABG’S Approval of Materials hereunder is specifically\nlimited to Approval of the use of the Personality Rights contained therein, and that to the extent any materials owned by third parties (e.g., logos,\nlocations, individuals, music, etc.) (“Third-Party Materials”) are incorporated therein, PAPA JOHN’S shall be solely responsible for identifying such\nThird-Party Materials, and for obtaining an appropriate license from the owner(s) of such Third-Party Materials to secure all applicable rights to use\nand otherwise exploit such Third-Party Materials.",
                "changed_text": "D.  Approval Standard. For purposes of this Agreement, “Approval” (and all grammatical variations thereof, e.g.,\nApprove, Approved, etc.) shall be defined as ABG’s prior written approval, which may be given or withheld in ABG’s reasonable discretion, considering industry standards and previous approvals. ABG has the\nright to Approve all uses of the Celebrity Endorsement and the Personality Rights, whether by PAPA JOHN’S or any of its approved designees\n(including, without limitation, the use of the Personality Rights in connection with any and all Products and Materials. PAPA JOHN’S hereby agrees\nthat: (A) no Materials may be released or exhibited publicly, in any manner, unless and until ABG has indicated informal consent, which may be reasonably inferred from prior course of dealing, (B) all Materials must be\nre-submitted for Approval only if substantial revisions are made introducing new elements not previously reviewed, and (C) ABG’S Approval of Materials hereunder extends to all elements of the materials, regardless of third-party ownership, and PAPA JOHN’S is not solely responsible for licensing those Third-Party Materials unless explicitly notified otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants ABG 'sole discretion' in approval, requiring re-submission for every revision, and limits ABG's approval to Personality Rights. The changed text introduces ambiguity by requiring ABG's 'reasonable discretion' considering industry standards, implying that approval decisions must have a rational basis. It also introduces 'informal consent' which can be inferred from prior dealings, and states that ABG’s Approval extends to ALL elements, contradicting the 'solely responsible' clause for Third-Party Materials in the original text. This creates an internal contradiction about the extent of ABG's approval responsibilities and the flexibility in the approval process.",

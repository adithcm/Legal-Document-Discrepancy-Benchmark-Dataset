                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions of 'End User.' Section 1.2 defines it broadly as any third party receiving content for payment. The added clause in Section 1.2 restricts the definition for revenue sharing to only those with a subscription lasting 30 days. This creates uncertainty: are all End Users counted for overall usage metrics, or only those who subscribe for 30 days? How does this impact report generation under section 3.3?",

For two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or an approved Transfer to a new franchisee, you may not directly or indirectly own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, or have any other interest in any Competitive Business that is, or intends to operate, within three (3) mile radius of the Premises of your Franchised Business or within a three (3) mile radius of any Restaurant then-operating or under construction to operate under the System, except as permitted by any Franchise Agreements that remain in effect between you and us.",

For two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or an approved Transfer to a new franchisee, you may not directly or indirectly own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, or have any other interest in any Competitive Business that is, or intends to operate, within five (5) mile radius of the Premises of your Franchised Business or within a one (1) mile radius of any Restaurant then-operating or under construction to operate under the System, except as permitted by any Franchise Agreements that remain in effect between you and us.",
                "explanation": "Changing the radius restrictions on competitive businesses after termination creates ambiguity. Originally, a consistent 3-mile radius was specified. The modification introduces a 5-mile radius from the franchisee's former location and a 1-mile radius from any active Pizza Fusion restaurant. This inconsistent application of different radii, depending on whether a business is close to the franchisee's old restaurant or another Pizza Fusion, leads to uncertainty in enforcement. A franchisee might struggle to understand how this restriction impacts their opportunities differently based on these varying distances.",

The\nOperating Principal must own a majority of the voting and ownership interests in the franchisee entity, unless you obtain our prior written approval\nfor the Operating Principal to hold a smaller interest. The Operating Principal must complete our training program, must have authority over all\nbusiness decisions related to the Franchised Business, and must have the power to bind you in all dealings with us. You may not change the\nOperating Principal without our prior approval.",

The Operating Principal must own at least 10% of the voting and ownership interests in the franchisee entity, but is not required to own a majority. The Operating Principal must complete our training program, must have authority over all business decisions related to the Franchised Business, and must have the power to bind you in all dealings with us. You may not change the Operating Principal without our prior approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Operating Principal to own a majority of the voting and ownership interests unless an exception is granted. The changed text sets the minimum ownership to at least 10%, and removes the 'majority' requirement entirely. This is a conflicting definition of what constitutes an acceptable Operating Principal, leading to potential disputes.",

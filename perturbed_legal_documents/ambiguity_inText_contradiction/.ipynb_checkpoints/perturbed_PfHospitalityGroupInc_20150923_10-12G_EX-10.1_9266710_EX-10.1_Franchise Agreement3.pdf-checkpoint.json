                "original_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity).",
                "changed_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); and/or (e) As used in this Agreement, the term \"Post-Term Period\" shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of one (1) year from the date of termination of Member's employment with Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Post-Term Period' as two years from various trigger events. The modified text introduces a conflicting definition stating the 'Post-Term Period' is one year specifically related to termination of employment. This creates ambiguity and a contradiction on how long the non-compete lasts after employment ends. There is now no explicit rule on how long the Post-Term period lasts if the franchise terminates or transfers.",

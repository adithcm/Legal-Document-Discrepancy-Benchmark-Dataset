Celebrity represents and warrants that during the Term and in the Territory, Celebrity will not endorse or make any appearances or advertisements on behalf of any other multivitamin that directly competes with Clotamin in the Washington, DC Metro Area. For endorsements outside of this specified territory, Celebrity is free to endorse other multivitamins.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction because the original clause provides a blanket exclusivity for all multivitamins, while the modified clause limits the exclusivity to competitors within a specific market. This introduces uncertainty about the scope of the exclusivity agreement - is celebrity allowed to endorse other multivitamins outside the Washington DC area?",

HDS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Celebrity in \nthe event Celebrity fails to perform the duties set forth in Paragraph 4 hereof or breaches any other \ncovenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of \nwritten notice. Such termination shall relieve HDS of its obligation to provide any further consideration \npursuant to this Agreement. However, termination under this clause does not relieve HDS from paying for services already rendered by Celebrity prior to the notice of termination.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. The original clause clearly states termination relieves HDS from any FURTHER obligation to provide any further consideration. The added clause however, requires HDS to pay for services already rendered despite the termination. Which takes precedence? The ambiguity might lead to disputes over whether HDS is required to pay for work Celebrity performed before termination, thus contradicting the general statement about relieved obligation.",

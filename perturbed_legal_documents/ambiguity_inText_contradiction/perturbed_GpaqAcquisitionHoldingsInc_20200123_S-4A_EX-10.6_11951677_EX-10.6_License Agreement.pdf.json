Operational influence is defined as the ability to affect day-to-day decisions regardless of equity ownership.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a second conflicting definition of \"control\" for the term 'Affiliate'. The original definition relies on equity or income interest exceeding 50%, or the power to direct management through ownership or contract. The modified definition includes 'significant operational influence' as a form of control, irrespective of equity ownership. This creates ambiguity because an entity might not meet the 50% equity/income threshold, yet be considered an Affiliate due to its operational influence, leading to disputes over the extent of control required to qualify as an Affiliate.",

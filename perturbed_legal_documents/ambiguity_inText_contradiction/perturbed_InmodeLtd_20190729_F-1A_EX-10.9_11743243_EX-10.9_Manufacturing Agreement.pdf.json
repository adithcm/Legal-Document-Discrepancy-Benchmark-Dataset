                "changed_text": "10.\nExpress Limited Warranty\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement, the \"Warranty Period\" shall mean six (6) months from the date the Product is shipped from the Contractor's facility.  Contractor represents and warrants that, for the Warranty Period, the Products (i) will be free from defects in workmanship, material, and manufacture; (ii) will comply with the Specifications IPC610.B standard.

High-Reliability Products are defined as those used in critical life-support applications.",
                "explanation": "The initial definition of 'Warranty Period' in Section 10 states it is twelve (12) months from the date of delivery to the Customer. The modified text introduces a conflicting definition by first reducing the warranty period to six months from the shipping date and then introducing a special category, 'High-Reliability' products, which are given an eighteen-month warranty from the date of final acceptance testing. This creates an internal contradiction. It becomes unclear exactly what the 'Warranty Period' is, particularly for products not explicitly listed in Exhibit A or whose application is ambiguous. This could lead to disputes over warranty claims and obligations.",

Thrivent Life Insurance Company.\nIs amended to read:\nWe, we, Our, our, Us, us, Society. Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of dividend distribution as detailed in SECTION 4, 'We, Our, Us' refers to Thrivent Life Insurance Company.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that 'We, Our, Us' refers to Thrivent Financial for Lutherans in the general definition section, but then clarifies that, specifically for dividend distribution (Section 4), it refers to Thrivent Life Insurance Company. This creates ambiguity in situations involving dividend calculations or legal interpretations concerning dividend-related responsibilities, making it unclear which entity's policies apply. This is inconsistent because Thrivent Life Insurance Company no longer exists, making dividend distribution ambiguous.",

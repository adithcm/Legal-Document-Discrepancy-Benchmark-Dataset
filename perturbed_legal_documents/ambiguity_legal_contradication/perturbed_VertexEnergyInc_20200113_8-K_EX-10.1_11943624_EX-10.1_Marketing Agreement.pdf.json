                "original_text": "Vertex shall promptly indemnify Bunker One and pay any and all damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys‘ fees, incident to any suits, actions, investigations, claims or proceedings suffered, sustained, incurred or required to be paid by Bunker One by reason of any negligence, gross negligence and/or intentional act or omission on the part of Vertex in rendering services hereunder, or any breach or failure of observance or performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Vertex hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "Vertex shall endeavor to indemnify Bunker One for damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, possibly including attorneys’ fees, related to suits, actions, investigations, claims or proceedings potentially arising from Vertex's actions or omissions in rendering services. The extent of this indemnification will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall promptly indemnify and pay any and all' with 'shall endeavor to indemnify,' making the indemnification discretionary. The term 'possibly including attorneys' fees' adds ambiguity to the obligation to cover legal costs. Stating the indemnification 'will be determined on a case-by-case basis' introduces further uncertainty, potentially conflicting with Alabama law regarding contractual obligations, which generally requires clear and definite terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Alabama contract law regarding definiteness of terms and enforceability of indemnification clauses (relevant case law regarding unambiguous contractual obligations in Alabama). While not a direct statutory violation, the ambiguity makes enforcement less certain under Alabama law.",

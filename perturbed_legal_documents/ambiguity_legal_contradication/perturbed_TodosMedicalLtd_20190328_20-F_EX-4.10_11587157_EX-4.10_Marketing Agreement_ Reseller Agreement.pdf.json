                "explanation": "The modification replaces \"shall comply\" with \"shall endeavor to comply\". This weakens the obligation, making it less stringent and opening it to interpretation regarding the level of effort required. This creates an ambiguous legal obligation.",

Using \"endeavor to comply\" could be interpreted as not requiring full compliance, thus violating these regulations.",

                "original_text": "8.4 Privacy. eDiets agrees to treat all consumer data collected from Women.com users on the Women.com Site in accordance with Women.com's privacy and security policies (the \"Women.com Data\"). Women.com reserves the right to change such policies in its sole discretion from time to time. In no event shall eDiets disclose or otherwise transfer to any person or entity any Women.com Data that individually or in the aggregate identifies the identity, habits or transactions of the Women.com users.",
                "changed_text": "8.4 Privacy. eDiets agrees to treat all consumer data collected from Women.com users on the Women.com Site in a manner generally consistent with Women.com's privacy and security policies (the \"Women.com Data\"). Women.com reserves the right to change such policies in its sole discretion from time to time. eDiets will endeavor to avoid disclosing or transferring to any person or entity Women.com Data that identifies the identity, habits or transactions of the Women.com users, but makes no guarantee as to complete anonymity.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict adherence to Women.com's privacy policies. The modified text uses weaker language like \"generally consistent\" and \"endeavor to avoid,\" creating ambiguity about the level of compliance required. Adding \"but makes no guarantee as to complete anonymity\" directly contradicts the user data protection implied by standard privacy practices and regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)/California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). Both laws require companies to provide clear and comprehensive privacy policies and ensure adequate protection of consumer data. The modified language introduces ambiguity that would likely violate the requirement to implement reasonable security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure and to provide adequate and conspicuous notice about information collection and usage practices.",

The modified text replaces \"Does not clearly state\" with \"Endeavors to provide some form of privacy information,\" weakening the obligation. \"Endeavors to provide some form\" is vague and does not guarantee a comprehensive or understandable privacy policy, leading to potential non-compliance with CCPA requirements for clear and transparent privacy disclosures. The phrase \"some form of privacy information\" is also unclear and could be interpreted as simply stating that the affiliate collects data, without detailing how the data is used, stored, or protected.",

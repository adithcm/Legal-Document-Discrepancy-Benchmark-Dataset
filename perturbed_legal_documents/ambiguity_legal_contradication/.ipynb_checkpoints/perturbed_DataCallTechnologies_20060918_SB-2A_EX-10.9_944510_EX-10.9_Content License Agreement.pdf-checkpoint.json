                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the obligation for plan_b to provide detailed reports. Replacing 'shall provide' with 'shall endeavor to provide' makes the reporting discretionary. The introduction of 'estimate,' 'where feasible,' and 'reasonably convenient' creates ambiguity around the content, format, and timing of the report. This contradicts generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) which emphasize the importance of accurate and timely financial reporting.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'must at all times' with 'should endeavor,' weakening the obligation to a suggestion rather than a strict requirement. Furthermore, replacing 'strictly in accordance with' to 'in general accordance with the spirit of' significantly broadens interpretation and introduces further ambiguity. This contradicts the concept of a lease, which provides specific, enforceable terms. It creates uncertainty about what compliance actually means, as 'the spirit of the terms' is highly subjective.",

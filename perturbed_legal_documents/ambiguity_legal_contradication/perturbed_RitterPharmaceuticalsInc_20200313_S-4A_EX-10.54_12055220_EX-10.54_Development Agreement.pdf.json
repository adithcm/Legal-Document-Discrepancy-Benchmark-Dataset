                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Qualigen shall be responsible for maintaining, at its sole cost, the Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen shall hold in its name all Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in a country or region and shall (to the extent commercially reasonable to do so) maintain in good standing all existing Regulatory Approvals. Qualigen and Sekisui shall provide reasonable advice and assistance to each other as may be necessary to maintain required Regulatory Approvals. In addition, Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval for any additional territories upon Sekisui’s commercially reasonable request.",
                "changed_text": "Qualigen shall generally be responsible for maintaining, at its own expense, the Regulatory Approvals necessary for the marketing and sale of the Products in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen shall endeavor to hold all Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in a country or region and may attempt to maintain all existing Regulatory Approvals. Qualigen and Sekisui may provide advice and assistance to each other in maintaining required Regulatory Approvals. Furthermore, Qualigen may consider using efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval for any additional territories upon Sekisui’s request.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with weaker terms like 'generally be responsible,' 'endeavor to hold,' 'may attempt to maintain,' and 'may consider using efforts.' The original text imposes a clear obligation on Qualigen to maintain regulatory approvals, while the modified version makes this obligation discretionary and uncertain. The lack of clear and mandatory language regarding maintaining regulatory approvals introduces significant ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "2.2. Compliance With Laws. Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business and shall notify Licensor of any action that must be taken by Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "changed_text": "2.2. Compliance With Laws. Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall endeavor to comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, marketing, and promotion of the business and may notify Licensor of any action that Licensee considers necessary to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply,' the obligation becomes less strict and more subjective. The original clause requires the Licensee to notify the Licensor of any actions *required* for compliance. By changing the clause, the Licensee only needs to notify the Licensor of actions it *considers* necessary for compliance. This introduces ambiguity because it gives the Licensee discretion in determining what actions are necessary and whether to inform the Licensor. This contradicts laws requiring strict compliance in business operations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws requiring strict adherence to regulations in business operations, where 'endeavor to comply' would not suffice. Specifically, this could cause issues with SEC regulations governing investment companies, as mere 'endeavoring' to comply with regulations is not sufficient.",

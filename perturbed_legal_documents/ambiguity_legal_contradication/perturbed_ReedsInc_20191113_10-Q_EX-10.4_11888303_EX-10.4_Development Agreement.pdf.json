                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Company shall perform the work in connection with this Agreement in a timely, professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards. Each party shall ensure that all persons performing work under this Agreement on its behalf shall have the requisite experience, training, skill and other qualifications needed to develop the Recipes, Deliverables and Specifications.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall endeavor to perform the work in connection with this Agreement in a reasonably timely manner, and shall use its best efforts to ensure that persons performing work under this Agreement on its behalf possess some level of experience, training, and skill deemed adequate by Company’s management.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires performance consistent with industry standards and ensuring requisite qualifications. The modified text weakens these obligations by replacing 'shall perform' with 'shall endeavor to perform in a reasonably timely manner,' making the timeliness subjective. Furthermore, substituting 'requisite experience, training, skill' with 'some level of experience, training, and skill deemed adequate by Company’s management' introduces ambiguity and allows Company to arbitrarily determine qualification levels, undermining the requirement for objectively demonstrated competence. This contradicts standards of reasonable care and competence expected in professional services and product development, potentially leading to products of substandard quality and exposing Reed's to liability.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law related to 'reasonable care' and 'due diligence', which require objective standards of performance, potentially violating consumer protection laws if the products are defective due to lack of adequate skills and training.",

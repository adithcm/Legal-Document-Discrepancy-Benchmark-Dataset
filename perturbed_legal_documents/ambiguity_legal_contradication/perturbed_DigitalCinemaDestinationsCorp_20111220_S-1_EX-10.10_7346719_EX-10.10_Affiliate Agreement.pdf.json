                "original_text": "Network Affiliate and NCM shall at all times operate and conduct its business, including, without limitation, exercising its rights under this Agreement, in compliance with all applicable international, national, state, and local laws, rules, and requirements.",
                "changed_text": "Network Affiliate and NCM shall endeavor to operate and conduct its business, including, without limitation, exercising its rights under this Agreement, in a manner generally consistent with applicable international, national, state, and local laws, rules, and requirements.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall at all times operate in compliance with' with 'shall endeavor to operate in a manner generally consistent with' weakens the legal obligation. 'Endeavor' implies an effort but not a guarantee of compliance, and 'generally consistent' allows for deviation. This contradicts the strict compliance required by many laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Numerous federal and state laws require strict compliance, including but not limited to environmental regulations, labor laws, and anti-discrimination laws (e.g., Clean Air Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Civil Rights Act).",

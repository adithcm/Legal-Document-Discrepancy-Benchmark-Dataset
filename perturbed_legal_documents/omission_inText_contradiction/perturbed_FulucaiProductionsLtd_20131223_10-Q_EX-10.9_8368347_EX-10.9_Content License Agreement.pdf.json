                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'The revenue share for the Program is stated in Exhibit B,' the contract now references a revenue share without specifying where the details of that share are defined. Other sections of the document still assume that Exhibit B exists and details revenue sharing, leading to an internal contradiction and ambiguity regarding the financial terms of the agreement.",

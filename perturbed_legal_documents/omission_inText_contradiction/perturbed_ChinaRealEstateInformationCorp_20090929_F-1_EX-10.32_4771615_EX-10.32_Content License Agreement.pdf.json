                "original_text": "10.12. Dispute Resolution. (a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (each, a “Dispute”), shall to the extent possible be settled through friendly consultation among the Parties hereto. The claiming Party (the “Claimant”) shall promptly notify the other Party (the “Respondent”) in a dated written notice that a Dispute has arisen and describe the nature of the Dispute. Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the “Commission”) to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission’s then effective rules (the “Rules”) and this Section 10.12. The language of the arbitration shall be Mandarin Chinese.\n(b) The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators. The Claimant shall appoint one (1) arbitrator, the Respondent shall appoint one (1) arbitrator, and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator. If the Claimant and the Respondent fail to appoint one (1) arbitrator, or the two (2) arbitrators appointed fail to appoint the third arbitrator within the time periods set by the then effective Rules, the relevant appointment shall be made promptly by the Commission.\n(c) Any award of the arbitration tribunal established pursuant to this Section 10.12 shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties shall use their best efforts to effect the prompt execution of any such award and shall render whatever assistance as may be necessary to this end. The prevailing Party (as determined by the arbitrators) shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred in connection with the arbitration and any judicial enforcement, unless the arbitrators determine that it would be manifestly unfair to honor this agreement of the Parties and determine a different allocation of costs.\n(d) The foregoing provisions in this Section 10.12 shall not preclude any Party from seeking interim or conservatory remedies, including injunctive relief, from any court having jurisdiction to grant such relief.",

                "explanation": "Removing subsections (b) and (c) creates an internal contradiction. Subsection (a) states that disputes will be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commission's rules and 'this Section 10.12'. However, the mechanism for constituting the arbitration tribunal and the enforcement of awards, which were previously in subsections (b) and (c), are now missing. This creates ambiguity about how the arbitration process will proceed beyond the initial submission and which rules govern it. The 'this Section 10.12' reference in (a) now points to an incomplete description of the arbitration process, making it contradictory to its original intent.",

                "original_text": "C.\nMaintenance Services \nNo-charge Maintenance Services shall be provided from the Delivery Date through the Warranty Period. The first paid (Initial) Maintenance Term\nshall commence upon expiration of the Warranty Period and shall continue for twelve (12) months thereafter. Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall\nautomatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates\nMaintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement. Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in\naccordance with the Section entitled “Termination” of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America\nshall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without paying any reinstatement fee. During the initial Maintenance Term and any\nrenewal term, Maintenance Fees shall be paid in the increments described below under “Payment Terms.”",

Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in\naccordance with the Section entitled “Termination” of the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines the terms for the initial and renewal of the Maintenance Term, including how 'Maintenance Fees shall be paid in the increments described below under “Payment Terms.”' Removing this section creates an internal contradiction because the contract still mentions 'Maintenance Fees' in other sections (e.g., Invoice Address), but the actual terms describing these fees have been removed. This makes it impossible to determine how and when Maintenance Fees should be paid.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder', the contract now allows Bank of America to terminate the schedule if the price increases, but it doesn't specify if Bank of America is entitled to a refund of previous payments. This creates an internal contradiction because it's unclear if the previous amount is lost in the event of a price increase and subsequent termination. The remaining part of the sentence indicates the potential for a refund by way of the original clause. It creates ambiguity around the refund process.",

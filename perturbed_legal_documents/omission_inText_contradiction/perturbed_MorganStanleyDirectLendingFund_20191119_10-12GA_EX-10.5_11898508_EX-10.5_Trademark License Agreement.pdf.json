This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice and immediately (a) if MS Capital Partners Adviser Inc. or another affiliate of Licensor is no longer acting as the investment adviser (any such entity, the “Advisor”) to Licensee under the Investment Advisory Agreement, dated as of [·], 201[9] (as the same may\n2\nSource: MORGAN STANLEY DIRECT LENDING FUND, 10-12G/A, 11/19/2019\n\nbe amended, modified or otherwise restated, the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), or a similar agreement, or (b) the Advisor is no longer an\naffiliate of Licensor. Further, Licensor may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice, at any time after 30 days from the date that\nLicensee notifies Licensor that the Investment Advisory Agreement has terminated or is not being renewed. The term “affiliate” as used herein\nshall have the meaning given to such term in the Investment Advisory Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.4. Termination of Advisory Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice and immediately (a) if MS Capital Partners Adviser Inc. or another affiliate of Licensor is no longer acting as the investment adviser to Licensee, or (b) the Advisor is no longer an affiliate of Licensor. Further, Licensor may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice.",
                "explanation": "By removing the references to the 'Investment Advisory Agreement' but keeping the termination clause based on the investment advisor relationship, the contract now lacks the defined connection. The definition of 'affiliate' is also removed. This creates ambiguity and the potential for disagreement on the conditions leading to termination, as the Investment Advisory Agreement and the definition of affiliate no longer exist in the contract but are still referenced implicitly.",

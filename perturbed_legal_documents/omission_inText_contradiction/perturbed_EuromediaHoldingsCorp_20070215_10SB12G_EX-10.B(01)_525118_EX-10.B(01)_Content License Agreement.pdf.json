                "explanation": "By removing the License Fee reduction clause when a Master is defective, it introduces an inconsistency if the clause is later referenced. For example, if paragraph 8(a) is changed to say: \"If the License fee reduction as described in 8(b) occurs, then...\", but 8(b) no longer describes the reduction, then we have an in-text contradiction. The contract refers to a 'license fee reduction', implying there will be one, but no longer specifies how it's calculated or applied.",

The help desk technicians shall respond to all Bank of America requests for support.",
                "explanation": "By removing the '24 hours a day, seven days a week' availability, and the 'fifteen (15) minutes' response time, the modified text creates an internal contradiction with the definition of Maintenance Period found in Section 1.26, which defines it as 'twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) per week, including Bank of America holidays.' Now the contract references a defined Maintenance Period, but a specific service is described in a way that may not align with that definition. A different section still references the 24/7 helpdesk support (SCHEDULE D - Maintenance Services), but Section C, (1) is not specific.",

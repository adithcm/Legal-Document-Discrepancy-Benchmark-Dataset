(“Phoenix Online”).",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Attachment 1, the contract now states that service fees will be mutually agreed upon. However, the original language commits to having the fee schedule detailed in Attachment 1. This removes the specific fee structure and creates a contractual ambiguity regarding the payment terms, which contradicts any implied commitment to the previous arrangement. Later disputes will arise on the fees, since that are not clearly defined.",

                "original_text": "4.2. Upon Termination. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Mark shall cease, and Licensee shall immediately delete the term “Palmer Square” from its corporate name and shall discontinue all other use of the Licensed Mark. For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "changed_text": "4.2. Upon Termination. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Mark shall cease, and Licensee shall immediately delete the term “Palmer Square” from its corporate name and shall discontinue all other use of the Licensed Mark.",
                "explanation": "By removing the second sentence of section 4.2, the obligation for the Licensee to specify on all public-facing materials that they are no longer associated with the Licensor after termination is removed. However, section 3.1 still states that Licensor has no obligation to indemnify Licensee with respect to any claims arising from Licensee’s use of the Licensed Mark, including without limitation any Third Party Claim. This creates an internal contradiction because the section referencing Third Party Claims is still present, while the section outlining the responsibility of the Licensee after termination to make known its separation from the Licensor has been removed. This implies the Licensee might still face claims, but no longer has the obligation (per 4.2) to alert the public to their dissociation.",

                "original_text": "Each of Reed’s and Company (a “Receiving Party”) shall hold in confidence and not make any commercial or other use of any or all Confidential Information conveyed, acquired or learned from the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) at any time, except in association with this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly permitted herein, Receiving Party shall not disclose such information to third persons without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall limit access to the Confidential Information to those of its directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, attorneys and accountants (the “Representatives”) with the need to know the same and shall advise such Representatives of, and hold them to, Receiving Party’s obligations under the terms of this Section 7. Receiving Party and its Representatives shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information as required by law, including to any judicial, regulatory, administrative or other governmental body (by interrogatories, investigative demands, requests for information or documents, subpoena, or other similar process), but must (to the extent legally permissible) promptly notify the disclosing party of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such requirement and give the disclosing party a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy to resist or narrow such disclosure.\n“Confidential Information” means all information of Disclosing Party that is disclosed orally or in writing by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party that, at the time of disclosure, is designated as confidential (or like designation), is disclosed in circumstances of confidence, would be understood by the parties, exercising reasonable business judgment, to be confidential, or is not generally known to the public, whether of a business, technical, or other nature, and including, without limitation, designs, plans, drawings, know-how, recipes, and marketing and business plans. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Receiving Party shall return to Disclosing Party all of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information or shall destroy the same at the option of Disclosing Party. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement. The obligations in this Section 7 regarding trade secrets, in particular, will continue for so long as the information constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. If an unauthorized use or disclosure of a Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information occurs, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party, and the Disclosing Party may take, at the Receiving Party’s expense, all steps which are necessary to recover Confidential Information disclosed or used in breach of this Agreement and to prevent its subsequent unauthorized use or dissemination, including availing itself of actions for seizure and injunctive relief.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'Confidential Information' from Section 7, the clause now lacks a clear understanding of what information needs to be protected. Section 21 still references 'disclosure of Confidential Information' as a material breach that warrants injunctive relief, but without a clear definition of 'Confidential Information,' the scope of this protection becomes ambiguous and unenforceable, thus creating a contradiction between the survival of the confidentiality obligations and the lack of a defined basis for those obligations.",

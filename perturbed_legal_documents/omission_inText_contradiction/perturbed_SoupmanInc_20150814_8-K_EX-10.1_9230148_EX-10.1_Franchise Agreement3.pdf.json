California Corporation Code 31512 voids a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code 31000 through 31516).

This contradicts the previously stated protections afforded to the franchisee under the Franchise Investment Law and the Franchise Relations Act, creating an internal contradiction and potentially misleading the franchisee.",

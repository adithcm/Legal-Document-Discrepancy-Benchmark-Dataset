                "explanation": "By removing the definition of '6.3.2', the contract still references the difference between the amount in 6.3.1 and what was formerly in section 6.3.2, without defining what that previous section meant. This leads to an ambiguous and unenforceable clause due to lack of context. Therefore, this causes an in-text contradiction, as it is no longer possible to calculate the difference.",

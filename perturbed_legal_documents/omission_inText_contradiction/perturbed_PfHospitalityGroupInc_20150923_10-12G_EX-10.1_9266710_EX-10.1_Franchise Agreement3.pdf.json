                "original_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the term “Post-Term Period” shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date\nof: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the\ncause for termination); (c) termination of Member’s employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of\narbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the\nenforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or\nentity).",

                "explanation": "By removing the term of two (2) years, the contract becomes ambiguous regarding the non-compete duration. While the Post-Term period is still mentioned and applicable upon the events listed, the specific length of the period is undefined. This contradicts the implied understanding that the non-compete has a set duration. It also makes enforcing the non-compete difficult, as the court may not know how long the term should last.",

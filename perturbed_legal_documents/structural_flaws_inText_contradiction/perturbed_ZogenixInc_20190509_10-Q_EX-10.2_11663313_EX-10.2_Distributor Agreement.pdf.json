Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Zogenix hereby appoints Distributor, and Distributor accepts appointment, as the exclusive distributor (even as to Zogenix) of the Product in the Field in the Territory during the Term, and grants to Distributor the exclusive rights to maintain Regulatory Approval of (while Distributor is the\nMAH Party), package, promote, market, offer for sale, sell, import and distribute the Product in the Field in the Territory during\nthe Term.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Zogenix hereby appoints Distributor, and Distributor accepts appointment, as a non-exclusive distributor of the Product in the Field in the Territory during the Term, and grants to Distributor the non-exclusive rights to maintain Regulatory Approval of (while Distributor is the\nMAH Party), package, promote, market, offer for sale, sell, import and distribute the Product in the Field in the Territory during\nthe Term.",
                "explanation": "Section 2.1 originally grants exclusive rights to the distributor. Changing 'exclusive distributor' to 'non-exclusive distributor' directly contradicts the original intent. This creates uncertainty as the contract now suggests that Zogenix can appoint other distributors in the same territory, undermining the distributor's expected return on investment and creating doubt about the enforceability of their distribution rights.",

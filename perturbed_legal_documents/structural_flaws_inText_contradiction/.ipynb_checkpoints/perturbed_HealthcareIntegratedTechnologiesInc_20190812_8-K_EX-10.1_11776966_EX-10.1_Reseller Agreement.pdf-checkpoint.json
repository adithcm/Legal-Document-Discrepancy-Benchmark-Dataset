                "original_text": "This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect for an initial period of 1 year (“Initial Term”). Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive 1-year terms (each a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”). Following the Initial Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon written notice to the other Party of at least 3 months.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect for an initial period of 1 year (“Initial Term”). Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive 1-year terms (each a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”). Following the Initial Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon written notice to the other Party of at least 3 months. *Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supplier may terminate this agreement at any time without cause or notice.*",
                "explanation": "The original clause stated the agreement automatically renews with a specific termination clause (3 months notice). The added sentence allows the Supplier to terminate at any time without cause or notice, contradicting the prior automatic renewal and termination notice requirements. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the reseller's rights and supplier's obligations related to the agreement term.",

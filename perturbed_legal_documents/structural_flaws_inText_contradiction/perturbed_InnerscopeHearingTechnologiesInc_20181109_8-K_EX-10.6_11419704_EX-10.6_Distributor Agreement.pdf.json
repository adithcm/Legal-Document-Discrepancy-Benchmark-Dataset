                "original_text": "b.\nEither party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, provided the breaching party is first given reasonably detailed, written notice of the breach. If the breach is not cured within ten days of such notice, the Agreement will terminate immediately.",
                "changed_text": "b.\nEither party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, provided the breaching party is first given reasonably detailed, written notice of the breach. Erchonia reserves the right to decide whether or not the breach warrants termination, regardless of the cure period. If the breach is not cured within ten days of such notice, Erchonia *may* terminate the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stated that the agreement 'will terminate immediately' if a breach is not cured within ten days. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that Erchonia 'may' terminate, and that Erchonia reserves the right to decide whether or not the breach warrants termination, even if the cure period has not expired. This contradicts the original, creating ambiguity about the termination terms and enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original clause 2 states that future amendments to the Distributor Agreement are incorporated into the Addendum only to the extent they don't conflict. Clause 5 says Addendum always takes precedence. By removing the caveat 'to the extent that the amendments do not conflict therewith' from clause 2, and adding 'regardless of any conflict', this now contradicts Clause 5 as it is ambiguous how to resolve potential conflicts between future Distributor Agreement amendments and the current Addendum.",

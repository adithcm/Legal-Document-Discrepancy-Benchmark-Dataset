                "explanation": "Section 15.1 originally stated that disputes would be resolved in Orange County, Florida. By changing the location to Tyler, Texas, it directly contradicts the original venue selection and creates uncertainty about which jurisdiction governs dispute resolution. This contradiction could lead to legal challenges regarding where lawsuits should be filed and which state's laws should be applied.",

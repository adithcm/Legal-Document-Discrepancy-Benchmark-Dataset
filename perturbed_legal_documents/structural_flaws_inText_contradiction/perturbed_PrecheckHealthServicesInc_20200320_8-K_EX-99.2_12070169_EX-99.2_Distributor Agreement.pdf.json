                "explanation": "Section 10 originally stated the agreement could be terminated by either party with 30 days' notice. By removing the 'either party' clause and stating that the Principal can terminate 'at any time, without cause, or notice,' it directly contradicts the original clause. This creates uncertainty and a conflict of interest, where the distributor is bound to the March 18, 2021 date and needs to give 30 days notice, but the principal can terminate at anytime.",

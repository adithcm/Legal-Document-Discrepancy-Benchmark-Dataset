                "original_text": "10.1 Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional, successive five (5) year periods unless either Party provides the other Party written notice of its desire to terminate at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any renewal.",
                "changed_text": "11.2 Waivers and Amendments. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of each of the Parties, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No failure on the part of a Party hereto to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. \n\n10.1 Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and end on the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional, successive five (5) year periods unless either Party provides the other Party written notice of its desire to terminate at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any renewal.",
                "explanation": "Moving the term clause to a position after the waivers and amendments clause creates a contradiction. The original text states that the contract automatically renews unless a party gives 120 days' notice. However, the waiver and amendments clause states that 'no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement... shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of each of the Parties.' This creates ambiguity because it is unclear whether the automatic renewal clause can be waived without a written agreement signed by both parties. It raises the question of whether a simple notice is sufficient to prevent renewal, or whether a formal, signed waiver is required. This contradiction could lead to disputes regarding the contract's term.",

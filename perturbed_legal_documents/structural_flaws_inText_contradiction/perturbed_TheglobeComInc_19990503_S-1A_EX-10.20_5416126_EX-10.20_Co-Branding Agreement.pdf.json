                "explanation": "By re-introducing a warranty statement within the 'No Warranties' section, we create an in-text contradiction. While the original section explicitly disclaims all warranties, the modified version introduces an express warranty for Boxlot's service to perform according to Exhibit B and globe templates to be free of defects. This creates confusion about whether any warranties are actually provided, making the contract terms ambiguous and potentially unenforceable regarding service performance.",

                "original_text": "11.1 AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. This Agreement will automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless either Party notifies the other at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable, of its intention not to renew this Agreement (a \"Termination Notice\").",
                "changed_text": "11.1 AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. This Agreement may renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), but such renewals are not guaranteed and depend on market conditions and mutual agreement. Notification of non-renewal may be provided at any time, at the discretion of either party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the contract auto-renews unless a termination notice is given. The modified clause makes renewal uncertain by stating it depends on market conditions and removes the requirement for a 30-day notice, directly contradicting the automatic renewal aspect and introducing ambiguity about when and how the agreement can be terminated.",

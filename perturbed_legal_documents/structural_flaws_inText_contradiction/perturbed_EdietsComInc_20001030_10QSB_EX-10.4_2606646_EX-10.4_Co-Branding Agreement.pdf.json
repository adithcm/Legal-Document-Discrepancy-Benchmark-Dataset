This Agreement will become effective as of the\nEffective Date and, unless sooner terminated pursuant to Sections 3.1  [Advertising and Promotion] or 10.2  [Termination for Breach],\nshall remain effective for two (2) years from and after the Effective Date (the\n\"Initial Term\"). This agreement will only renew if both parties provide written consent no more than thirty (30) days prior to the termination date.",
                "explanation": "Section 10.1 originally stated that the agreement would auto-renew for twelve-month periods, unless written notification was given 60 days prior to the termination date. Changing the location and modifying the clause to indicate that the agreement will ONLY renew if both parties provide written consent no more than 30 days prior to the termination date creates a contradiction because the original text does not require explicit consent to renew. This internal contradiction could lead to disputes over the terms of renewal.",

                "explanation": "The original text states a 60-day notice is required for non-cause termination. Changing it to 30 days directly contradicts section 10, which details specific termination clauses, including the 60-day notice for non-cause termination mentioned in the preamble. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual required notice period for termination.",

                "explanation": "Section 5.1 originally defined a fixed term of 15 months. Changing it to an indefinite term creates a direct contradiction. This is further amplified because Section 5.2 allows termination for breach after 30-60 days notice. The conflicting terms of having an indefinite contract and the ability to exit so quickly introduces uncertainty about the actual duration and commitment expected of the parties, potentially causing confusion and legal disputes.",

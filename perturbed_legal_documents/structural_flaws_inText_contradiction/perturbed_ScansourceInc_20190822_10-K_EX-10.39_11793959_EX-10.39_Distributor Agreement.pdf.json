                "original_text": "1. The Term of the Agreement is hereby extended to January 20, 2012 unless sooner terminated as provided for in the Agreement. If the Agreement\nexpired prior to the Amendment Effective Date, any orders received and Products and Services purchased between the date of expiration and the\nAmendment Effective Date shall be in all respects deemed made under the Agreement as in effect prior to this Amendment. The parties further\nagree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such\nPurchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; provided, however that acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase\nOrder placed after the Agreement has expired will not be considered as an extension of the term of the Agreement nor a renewal thereof.\nNotwithstanding Cisco’s right to extend the term of the Agreement, each party acknowledges that the Agreement shall always be interpreted as\nbeing limited in duration to a definite term and that the other party has made no commitments whatsoever regarding the renewal of the Agreement\nbeyond those expressly agreed in writing.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that accepting purchase orders after the agreement expires does NOT extend or renew the agreement. The modified clause states that accepting purchase orders AFTER the agreement expires WILL be considered an AUTOMATIC extension and renewal of the agreement. This creates a direct contradiction and uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement is automatically renewed.",

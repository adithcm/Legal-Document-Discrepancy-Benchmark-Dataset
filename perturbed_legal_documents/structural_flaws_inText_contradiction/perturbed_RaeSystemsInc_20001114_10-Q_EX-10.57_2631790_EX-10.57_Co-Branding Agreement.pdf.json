Neither  NETTAXI  or  SpinRecords.com shall assign its\n             ----------\nrespective  rights  or delegate its obligations hereunder, either in whole or in\npart,  whether  by  operation  of  law  or  otherwise, without the prior written\nconsent  of  the other party. Any attempted assignment or delegation without the\nother  party's  written  consent  will  be  void.",
                "changed_text": "2.5     Additional  Statements  of  Work.  If  the parties hereto desire to\n             --------------------------------\nengage  each  other  for  additional  services  which  are  not  included in the\nStatement  of Work and which do not constitute merely a revision or modification\nof  the  Statement of Work, the parties shall in good faith negotiate additional\nStatements  of  Work,  each of which upon signing shall be deemed a part of this\nAgreement.  Additional  Statements  of  Work  shall  be  entered  into by mutual\nagreement  between NETTAXI and SpinRecords.com and shall be substantially in the\nform  of  the Statement of Work attached hereto. Each Statement of Work shall be\nsigned  by  authorized  representatives of the parties. This Agreement may cover\nmore  than  one  Statement  of  Work  at  any  given  time.\n9.7     Assignment.  NETTAXI  or  SpinRecords.com may assign its respective rights or delegate its obligations under this agreement whether by operation of law or otherwise. The assignee or delegatee will not be bound by all the provisions of this agreement. Any liabilities arising from this assignment will be the sole responsibility of the original party. This assignment can take place without the consent of the other party.",
                "explanation": "Section 9.7 originally states that neither party can assign its rights or obligations without the other party's written consent. By appending this to Section 2.5 and modifying the text, we create a contradiction. The modified Section 9.7 allows assignment without consent. The assignee or delegatee will not be bound by all the provisions of the agreement and all liabilities arising from this assignment will be the sole responsibility of the original party, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over contractual obligations and liability. The uncertainty around liabilities makes the overall contract unenforceable.",

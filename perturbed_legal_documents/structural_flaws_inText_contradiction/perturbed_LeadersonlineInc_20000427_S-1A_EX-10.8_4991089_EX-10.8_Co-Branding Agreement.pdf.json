                "original_text": "12.4.  No Assignment.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, neither Party\nshall transfer, assign or cede any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder,\nin whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the\nprior written consent of the other Party,\n                                       14\nwhich consent may be withheld at the other Party's reasonable business\ndiscretionÍ¾ provided, however, that VerticalNet may transfer this Agreement\nwithout the prior written consent of LeadersOnline to an Affiliate of\nVerticalNet, or to the surviving Party in a merger or consolidation, or to a\npurchaser of all or substantially all of its assets.",
                "changed_text": "12.4.  No Assignment. Except as otherwise set forth herein, neither Party shall transfer, assign or cede any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld at the other Party's reasonable business discretion. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, either party may freely assign this agreement to any affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity without the need for prior written consent. Such assignment shall be effective upon written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the assignment clause. The original clause states that neither party can assign the agreement without prior written consent, except in specific cases for VerticalNet. The modified clause then states that either party can freely assign the agreement to an affiliate, subsidiary, or successor entity without consent, effectively negating the initial restriction and introducing uncertainty as to when consent is actually needed for assignment.",

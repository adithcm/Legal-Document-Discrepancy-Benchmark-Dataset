                "original_text": "18.8 In the event of termination by Cisco for convenience, termination by Distributor for Cisco's material breach, or expiration of this Agreement where Cisco has provided Distributor with written notice from an authorized representative of its intention not to renew the Agreement, Cisco agrees to repurchase all Product in Distributor's inventory within [*****] days following the effective date of termination or expiration. Within [*****] days following the effective date of termination or expiration, Distributor shall return to Cisco all Product held in inventory as of the effective date of termination. Distributor shall receive credit for any Product so returned in an amount equal to the original purchase price thereof, less any credits or discounts which have been previously paid or applied to Distributor. Such credits shall be first applied to any uncontested amounts due Cisco. Any remaining balance shall be payable to Distributor as soon as commercially practicable. Cisco shall have the option to select the method of return and shall bear all freight costs associated with returns of Product by Distributor under this Section 18.8.",
                "changed_text": "18.8 In the event of termination by Cisco for convenience, termination by Distributor for Cisco's material breach, or expiration of this Agreement where Cisco has provided Distributor with written notice from an authorized representative of its intention not to renew the Agreement, Cisco *may* repurchase Product in Distributor's inventory within [*****] days following the effective date of termination or expiration *at its sole discretion*. Within [*****] days following the effective date of termination or expiration, Distributor *may* return to Cisco all Product held in inventory as of the effective date of termination, *subject to Ciscoâ€™s approval*. Distributor shall receive credit for any Product so returned in an amount equal to *up to* the original purchase price thereof, less any credits or discounts which have been previously paid or applied to Distributor. Such credits shall be first applied to any uncontested amounts due Cisco. Any remaining balance *may be* payable to Distributor as soon as commercially practicable. Cisco *and the distributor will mutually decide* the method of return and *split* all freight costs associated with returns of Product by Distributor under this Section 18.8.",
                "explanation": "The original clause 18.8 mandates Cisco to repurchase distributor's inventory in specific termination scenarios. The modified version introduces 'may' and 'at its sole discretion,' which directly contradicts the original mandatory repurchase obligation and creates uncertainty for the distributor. This makes the clause unenforceable due to the discretionary nature of the action and shifting the cost burden to the distributor. There is no longer a mandatory requirement for Cisco to repurchase, creating a point of conflict.",

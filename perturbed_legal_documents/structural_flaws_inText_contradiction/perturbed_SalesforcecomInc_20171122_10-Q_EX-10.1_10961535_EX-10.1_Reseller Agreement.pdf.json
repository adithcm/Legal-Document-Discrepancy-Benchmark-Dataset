The terms and conditions herein contained constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Sub-Reseller Agreement and supersede any previous and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.",

                "explanation": "By repeating the 'Resale Rights' section after the 'Entire Agreement' clause, we introduce a contradiction. The 'Entire Agreement' clause states that the current terms supersede all prior agreements. However, repeating the 'Resale Rights' section implies that section has special status or is particularly important, potentially re-introducing ambiguity about which agreement governs the resale rights. Does the first instance prevail, or the second? The repetition creates uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "11. The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall\n         continue for a term of one (1) year. Either party may terminate this agreement at any time, with or without cause, by providing written notice to the other party. mPhase shall have the right to\n         annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual\n         expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent\n         shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                "explanation": "The original clause 11 provides that the agreement auto-renews unless terminated with 30 days written notice. By adding 'Either party may terminate this agreement at any time, with or without cause, by providing written notice to the other party,' it creates a contradiction. Now, one sentence suggests the agreement can be terminated at any time with written notice and another says it auto-renews unless 30-day notice is given. The clause regarding 30-day notice only makes sense within the context of the contract otherwise auto-renewing. This creates uncertainty about the duration and termination conditions, making the contract ambiguous and potentially unenforceable as it relates to early termination or renewal.",

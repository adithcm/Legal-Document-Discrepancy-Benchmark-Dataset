                "explanation": "Moving the warranty clause after the Customer Records clause causes a contradiction. The original contract implies a standard warranty period after shipment. However, the repositioning implies that the warranty is contingent upon and follows a successful audit of the customer's records, meaning no warranty applies until an audit occurs and confirms compliance. This creates uncertainty about when the warranty starts and its relationship to compliance verification, potentially voiding or delaying the warranty in practice.",

The Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms (each a “Renewal Term”) only if both parties provide written consent 30 days before renewal.",
                "explanation": "Section 10.1 originally stated the agreement auto-renews unless either party gives notice of termination. The changed version states that the agreement only renews if both parties provide written consent. This creates an internal conflict and uncertainty about the renewal process. One version implies automatic renewal unless actively cancelled, while the other demands explicit agreement for renewal.",

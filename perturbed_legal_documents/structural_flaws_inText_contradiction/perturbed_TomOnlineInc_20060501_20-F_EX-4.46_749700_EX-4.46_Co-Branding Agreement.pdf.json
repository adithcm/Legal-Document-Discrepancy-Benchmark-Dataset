The obligations outlined in sections 11.1 through 11.4 regarding Confidential Information will be upheld during the term of this agreement and for a period of one year following its termination or expiration. Section 1, 4.2 (but not 4.2.3.2.4), 5.4, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 7, 12, 13, and 14 and the obligation to pay any amount accrued but not yet paid shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the duration of confidentiality obligations. The original Section 14.15 states that Section 11 survives the termination of the agreement, implying indefinite confidentiality. By contrast, defining the term of confidentiality in Section 11.5 contradicts this and creates an in-text contradiction about how long to uphold confidentiality. It creates an enforcement issue.",

        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it doesn't specify the duration or frequency of the maintenance. It gives i-on the liberty to perform maintenance at any time without informing the customer, which could disrupt the Customer's access to their website and lead to potential losses. This lacks a specific timeframe or constraints, potentially causing disputes over what constitutes 'reasonable' maintenance.",

        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency here. The contract states that i-on will maintain the Hosted Site continuously, 24/7, but then immediately contradicts itself by saying that this is with the exception of necessary hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or Hosted Site, without prior notice. This means that the service is not, in fact, continuous.",

        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This clause contradicts standard legal principles regarding liability. Generally, parties are not held liable for errors in judgment or mistakes of law unless there is some level of culpability, such as negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct. Holding the Sponsor liable even without such culpability is an unusually strict standard and could be considered an overreach.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction regarding the level of responsibility Domini has for its subcontractors. It states that Domini does not need approval to find the subcontracting party qualified. Then it states that Domini is not fully responsible for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence. This implies that Domini has no responsibility for the selection of qualified parties to perform the contracted work, which contradicts the intended meaning of the contract.",

        "explanation": "The agreement outlines a penalty for termination equal to one year of average management fees collected over the prior three years. While not inherently illegal, such a significant penalty for termination, regardless of the reason, could be viewed as an unreasonable restriction on the ability to terminate the contract. This penalty could be challenged as an unenforceable liquidated damages clause if it is deemed disproportionate to the actual damages suffered by the non-terminating party. This creates ambiguity because it can be deemed unenforceable.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that it will renew for one (1) or more one (1) month periods, unless notice is given. It also states that either party may terminate the agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice. The contradiction is that if the agreement automatically renews for only one (1) month at a time, then the 30 days written notice to terminate without cause contradicts with the one (1) month renewal period.",

Later it says that the agreement will renew for one (1) or more one (1) month periods. It is not structured properly, because if the agreement will continue for a period of six months, then stating that it will renew for one (1) month periods after this does not make sense.",

This is ambiguous because it does not clarify whether the 15-day notice applies only to the monthly renewals or also to the initial six-month term. If it applies to the initial term, then either party could technically provide notice 15 days before the end of the six-month period to prevent renewal, but it's not explicitly stated.",

        "explanation": "This definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is unusually narrow, limiting its use to ADAMS GOLF's internal documentation. This contradicts the general understanding of an endorsement agreement, which typically involves public promotion. This limited definition is misaligned with the overall purpose described in the 'WHEREAS' clause (advertisement and promotion of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT).",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Requiring repayment from the CONSULTANT's estate if he dies is contradictory. The inability to perform the agreement is due to death, and recouping the money already paid is an unfair and insensitive practice. It also disincentivizes the consultant from entering the contract.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The sentence structure is flawed and creates ambiguity. The phrase 'the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for...the distribution of shares of any series' is confusing because it is negated by the 'Notwithstanding the foregoing' clause. It's unclear whether the Sponsor is responsible or not for these activities. It appears to be written that the sponsor shall NOT be responsible for the management of the Trust's assets.",

        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit the Sponsor's liability but the wording is contradictory. It states the Sponsor is liable for 'any error of judgment or mistake of law' but then excludes liability for 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence...or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations'. Willful misfeasance, bad faith and gross negligence can all be considered errors of judgment or mistakes of law. This creates an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'with respect to any series or the Trust' is ambiguous. Does this mean the agreement can be terminated for one series while remaining active for others, or does it mean the entire agreement can be terminated? This lack of clarity creates potential disputes over the scope of termination.",

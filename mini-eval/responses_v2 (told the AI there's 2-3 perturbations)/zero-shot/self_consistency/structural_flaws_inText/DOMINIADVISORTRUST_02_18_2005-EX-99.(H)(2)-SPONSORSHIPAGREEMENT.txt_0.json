        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit Domini's liability for subcontractors' actions only to the extent of the subcontractor's insurance coverage and excludes responsibility for actions outside the contracted services. This could be problematic. Generally, a company is responsible for the actions of its subcontractors within the scope of the contracted work, regardless of the subcontractor's insurance or the specific services outlined. This clause could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent liability for negligence or breach of contract by a subcontractor, which may not be legally enforceable in all jurisdictions. This creates ambiguity about the true extent of Domini's responsibility and could contradict legal standards regarding vicarious liability.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an internal contradiction. It first states that the agreement can be terminated at any time without penalty by either party with 60 days' notice. However, it then introduces a penalty for the Sponsor if they terminate the agreement within the first year. This contradicts the initial statement of 'without the payment of any penalty'.",

Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust, which shall include without limitation: ... (d) overseeing (with advice of the Trust's counsel) the preparation of and, if applicable, filing all documents required for compliance by the Trust with applicable laws and regulations (including state \"blue sky\" laws and regulations), including registration statements on Form N-1A, prospectuses and statements of additional information, or similar forms, as applicable, semi-annual and annual reports to shareholders and proxy statements, and reviewing tax returns;",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'if applicable' within section 1(d) creates ambiguity regarding the Sponsor's obligation. It's unclear under what circumstances the preparation and filing of compliance documents *wouldn't* be applicable. This could lead to a dispute if the Sponsor fails to prepare or file a required document, arguing it wasn't 'applicable' without a clear definition of what that means. This lack of clarity undermines the Sponsor's stated duty to oversee compliance with applicable laws and regulations.",

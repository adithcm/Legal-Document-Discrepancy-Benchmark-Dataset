This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is ambiguous because it severely restricts the use of Consultant's identity to only his name, which contradicts the general purpose of an endorsement agreement where the consultant's likeness and image are typically valuable assets for promotion.",

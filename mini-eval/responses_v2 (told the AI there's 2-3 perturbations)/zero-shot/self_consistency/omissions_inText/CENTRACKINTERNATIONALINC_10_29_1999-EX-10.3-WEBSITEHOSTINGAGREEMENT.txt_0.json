        "explanation": "The phrase 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance' lacks a clear definition, creating ambiguity. There's no limit defined for the maintenance, which means that i-on can do maintenance at any time of their choosing, which directly contradicts the original statement.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",

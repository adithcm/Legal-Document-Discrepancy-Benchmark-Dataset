To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order,  which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either  accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of  such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall  be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized  representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the  terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be  bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.  The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address:\n\nAccuray Incorporated\nATTN: Contracts Administration\n1310 Chesapeake Terrace\nSunnyvale, CA 94089\nMain: (408) 716-4600\nFax: (408) 789-4205\nEmail: Orders@accuray.com",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the text regarding the approval of the Purchase Order. The first part of the paragraph implies that a lack of response from Accuray within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, the subsequent sentence states that 'Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.' This implies that execution is required for acceptance, contradicting the earlier statement that inaction equals disapproval.",

For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months  prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "The statement 'the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8' introduces ambiguity. Section 4.8 describes the circumstances under which a distributor may enter into a service agreement with a customer. This means it is not clear under which conditions the agreement is between Accuray and the Customer and Accuray and the Distributor.",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor  shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor  may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's  reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray  shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra  insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the  need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray,  if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if  a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses  required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was  October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section on 'Shipment' includes contradictory statements regarding who bears the cost of expedited delivery. It says 'Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor.' However, it then presents an example where, if the delivery date is less than six months after the purchase order, the expedited delivery expenses are borne by the Distributor.

If Accuray  does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation  (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider).

It says 'Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects... for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor'.

        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  <*$p$*>In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The text states that the agreement may be renewed for successive one-year terms by mutual written agreement. However, it then introduces a clause for automatic renewal if neither party provides notice of non-renewal, effectively contradicting the requirement for mutual written agreement. This creates confusion about the actual renewal process and whether mutual consent is always necessary.",

In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow <*$p$*>Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The wording 'Content and or the Services provided to Customers' is ambiguous. It's unclear whether i-Escrow indemnifies 2TheMart for claims arising solely from the 'Content,' solely from the 'Services,' or from both. The use of 'and or' creates uncertainty and could lead to disputes about the scope of i-Escrow's indemnification obligations.",

        "explanation": "While it's standard practice to state that headings are for reference only, this statement can create ambiguity. If a heading clearly and accurately summarizes the content of a section, a court might consider it as indicative of the parties' intent. Stating that headings *in no way* define the scope of the section could be interpreted as an attempt to prevent a court from using headings as an aid in interpretation, even when they are helpful, which is contradictory.",

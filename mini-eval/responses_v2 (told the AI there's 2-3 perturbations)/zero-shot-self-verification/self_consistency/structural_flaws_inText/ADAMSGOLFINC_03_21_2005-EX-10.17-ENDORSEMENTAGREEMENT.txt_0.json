This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is too restrictive. By excluding essential elements like photograph, likeness and image. It makes the endorsement commercially unviable, as endorsements typically involve more than just the name. This creates an ambiguity as to the value of the endorsement itself, as it deviates significantly from typical endorsement agreements.",

He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section allows CONSULTANT to use any golf clubs, even those from competitors, but also encourages the use of MANDATORY PRODUCTS. This creates a contradiction because it's unclear how much emphasis should be placed on using the MANDATORY PRODUCTS if the consultant has the freedom to use competitors' products. Furthermore, the clause allowing the endorsement of competitor's clubs creates a direct conflict of interest and weakens the endorsement agreement.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit Domini's liability for subcontractors' actions to the extent of the subcontractor's insurance coverage and only for contracted services. However, this is an overreach. Domini cannot completely absolve itself of responsibility for its subcontractors, especially if Domini was negligent in selecting or supervising the subcontractor. This limitation may be unenforceable under general principles of agency law, which hold principals responsible for the actions of their agents (subcontractors in this case).",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the termination clause. The first sentence states that the agreement can be terminated at any time without penalty, but the second sentence immediately contradicts this by imposing a penalty on the Sponsor if they terminate within the first year. This creates an in-text contradiction as to whether a penalty applies or not.",

        "explanation": "The statement that Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services is too broad and potentially legally problematic. While Domini might not be directly liable for actions completely unrelated to the subcontracted services, it could still be liable if its own negligence contributed to the harm, even if the subcontractor's actions were the immediate cause. This could be seen as an attempt to improperly limit liability.",

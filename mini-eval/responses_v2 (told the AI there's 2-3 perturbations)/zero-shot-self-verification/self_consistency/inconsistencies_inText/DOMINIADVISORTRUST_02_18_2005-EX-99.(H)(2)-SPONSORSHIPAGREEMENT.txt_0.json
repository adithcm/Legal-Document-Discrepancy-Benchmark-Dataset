The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.",
        "explanation": "The initial statement says that Domini will cover the salaries of the Trust's Trustees, officers, and agents if they devote time to Domini's affairs. The last statement then says that the Trust will cover the compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. This creates confusion as to whether the Trust's Trustees are paid by Domini or by the Trust.",

        "explanation": "It's structurally flawed and doesn't make sense. The section begins by stating Domini will pay salaries for those working on Domini's affairs but then says these salaries aren't expenses for the Trust under Section 2. Then, it abruptly states the Trust covers operating expenses, EXCEPT sponsor fees, unaffiliated Trustee compensation, AND legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. This is a structural flaw in text.",

        "explanation": "The contradiction is that the agreement can be terminated at any time, but also requires a 60-day written notice and a $10,000 penalty. The 'at any time' conflicts with the 60-day notice and the penalty, creating ambiguity about the true termination conditions.",

Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The document states two different timeframes for the project completion. The first states that the Company will use its best effort to deliver within 12 weeks. Then it states that the Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks. This is a contradiction, because both statements cannot be true.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "There is an in-text contradiction because $40 + 25% is $50, not $100. The final statement says 'whichever is lower' when in fact $50 is less than $100. This creates ambiguity as to which rate should be applied.",

        "explanation": "The description of BorrowMoney.com, inc's duties is vague and lacks specificity. It is unclear what 'HTML code' entails, the exact nature of 'technical aspect requirements,' and the scope of 'medical dispatch personal & product service.' The phrase 'as needed' further contributes to the ambiguity. It doesn't clearly define the deliverables or the level of service expected. In addition, there are grammatical errors in the description. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes regarding the scope of BorrowMoney.com, inc's responsibilities.",

        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous and structurally flawed. It's unclear whether the $60,000 is a fixed contribution from the contracts, or a target to be reached, or a projection. The phrase 'From Monthly Government, City And State, And Or Private Awarded Contracts' is grammatically incorrect and doesn't clearly define the source of the funds. It does not clearly state if the $60,000 is from all the contracts or each individual contract. In addition, it is not clear as to what awarded contract the 10% is referring to.",

        "explanation": "This description lacks clarity and completeness. The phrase 'Leased/rent office Space Includingspecified Description of duty*' is unclear and doesn't adequately describe the office space being contributed. The word 'Includingspecified' is not a valid word, and the phrase 'Description of duty*' ends abruptly, leaving the sentence incomplete. It's impossible to determine what duties are included with the office space.",

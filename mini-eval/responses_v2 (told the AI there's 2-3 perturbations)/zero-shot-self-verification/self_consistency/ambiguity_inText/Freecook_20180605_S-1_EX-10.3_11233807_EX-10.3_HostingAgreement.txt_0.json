        "section": "Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay.",
        "explanation": "This statement is overly broad and likely unenforceable. Unforeseen circumstances (illness, natural disasters, etc.) could legitimately cause delays. Absolving Company of any responsibility for delays, regardless of cause, is unreasonable and potentially contradicts general principles of contract law regarding force majeure or impossibility of performance. It could be seen as an attempt to shield the company from any liability, even in situations beyond their control. Therefore, it is a legal contradiction.",

The costs of any such changes shall be added to the Contract Price. Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Additional Work\" includes \"significant changes in the Scope of Work.\" This is circular logic and provides no real clarity. A change to the scope of work is defined as a change to the scope of work. This lack of definition creates ambiguity as to what constitutes 'Additional Work' requiring a Change Order, leading to potential disputes.",

        "explanation": "There are two contradicting concepts within these lines. First, the company guarantees to deliver the website within a specific time frame. Secondly, the client acknowledges that due dates are not subject to any delay. This is contradictory, as a guarantee usually allows for a margin of error. If there is no room for any delay, that contradicts the definition of the guarantee.",

The phrase 'From Monthly Government, City And State, And Or Private Awarded Contracts' is not grammatically correct, making it hard to understand the origin or nature of these funds and how the $60,000 relates to the awarded contracts. It is also unclear if the 10% comes from all contracts, or just the ones that make up the $60,000.",

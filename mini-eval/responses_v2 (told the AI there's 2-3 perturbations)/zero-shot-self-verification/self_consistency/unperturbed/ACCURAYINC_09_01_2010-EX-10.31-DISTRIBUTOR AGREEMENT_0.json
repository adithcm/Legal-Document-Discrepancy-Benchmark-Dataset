Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Distributor may present for approval  to Accuray opportunities for sales of Products and Services at prices that differ from the prices set forth in the then current  price list. Accuray may, in its sole and absolute discretion, approve any such opportunity, and if approved in writing by  Accuray, Distributor shall otherwise be permitted to pursue such opportunity at such prices, which opportunity shall  otherwise be governed by and pursued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement' followed by 'Distributor may present for approval to Accuray opportunities for sales of Products and Services at prices that differ from the prices set forth in the then current price list' creates an ambiguity in text. This statement can be interpreted in multiple ways, especially considering the pricing was adressed in the section before this one. This gives rise to potential disputes about which pricing mechanism to follow, because it is not clear enough.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order,  which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either  accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of  such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall  be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized  representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the  terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be  bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.  The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address:\n\nAccuray Incorporated\nATTN: Contracts Administration\n1310 Chesapeake Terrace\nSunnyvale, CA 94089\nMain: (408) 716-4600\nFax: (408) 789-4205\nEmail: Orders@accuray.com",
        "explanation": "The part saying 'Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval' is ambigious in text because it does not make clear what exactly constitutes disapproval. This could be interpreted as a silent rejection, but it is not explicitly defined, leading to potential confusion and disputes about the status of purchase orders.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  <*$p$*>A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the language regarding renewal. The first portion states that renewal requires \"mutual written agreement,\" suggesting an active decision by both parties. However, the subsequent sentences state that the agreement is \"automatically renewed\" if notice is not given, implying a passive renewal. This creates ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS] does not provide any means for termination, only that, i-Escrow may place banner advertising on the Co-Branded Site upon prior written approval of 2TheMart, which shall be at the discretion of 2TheMart.

        "explanation": "This section is structurally flawed because it's confusing. The phrase in parenthesis, \"except that i-Escrow may sell all or a majority of its equity securities or voting interests to i-Escrow.com, and i-Escrow.com may sell all or a majority of its equity securities or voting interests to i-Escrow's existing shareholders, without triggering the foregoing\" disrupts the flow of the sentence and makes it difficult to understand the conditions under which termination is allowed. It's unclear whether this parenthetical statement is meant to apply only to i-Escrow or also to 2TheMart.",

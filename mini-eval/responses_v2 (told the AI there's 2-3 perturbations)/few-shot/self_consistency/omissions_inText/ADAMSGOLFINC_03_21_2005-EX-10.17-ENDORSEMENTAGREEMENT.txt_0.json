The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a contradiction. While it states that repayment should be calculated as per paragraph 8A, paragraph 8A outlines a schedule for repayment based on the number of events *not* played in a year.  This termination clause implies a different type of repayment (for the entire unperformed period), and applying 8A's formula doesn't logically fit this scenario.",

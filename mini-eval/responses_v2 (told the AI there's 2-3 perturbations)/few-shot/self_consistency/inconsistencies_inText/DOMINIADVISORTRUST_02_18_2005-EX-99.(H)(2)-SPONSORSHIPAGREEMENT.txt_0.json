        "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction. It states that the Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses except legal counsel fees, which Domini will cover. However, later in Section 2, it also states, \"expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants\". Thus, it is unclear which party shall cover these costs.",

        "explanation": "The inclusion of the $10,000 penalty for termination creates ambiguity. If termination can occur 'at any time,' the purpose of a penalty is unclear and may conflict with the 'at any time' clause, as the penalty introduces a potential restriction.",

While Domini can subcontract, completely absolving itself of responsibility for the subcontractor's actions, even if those actions directly relate to Domini's obligations under the agreement, is problematic. Standard legal practice usually holds the primary contractor responsible for the performance of its subcontractors.",

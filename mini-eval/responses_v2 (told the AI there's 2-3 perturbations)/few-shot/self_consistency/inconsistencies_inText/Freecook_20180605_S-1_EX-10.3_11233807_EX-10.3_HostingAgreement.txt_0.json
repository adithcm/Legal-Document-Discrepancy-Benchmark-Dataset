Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The document states that the company will use its best efforts to deliver the website within the timeframe specified (12 weeks), but then immediately states that completion is guaranteed within 8 weeks. This creates a contradiction. It cannot be both that the company will use its best efforts to meet a 12 week deadline AND guarantee an 8 week deadline.",

While it states the Client agrees that positive feedback can be used, it doesn't specify whether the Client needs to be notified before their feedback is used, or whether they have the right to revoke this permission at a later date. Without these clarifications, there is uncertainty.",

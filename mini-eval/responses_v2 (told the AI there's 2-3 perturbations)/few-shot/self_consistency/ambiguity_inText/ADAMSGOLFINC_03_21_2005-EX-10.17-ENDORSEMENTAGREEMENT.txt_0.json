        "explanation": "The redacted terms makes it impossible to ascertain the length of the contract. This is a structural flaw as it impacts many sections of the contract and is not clear on when the contract will actually end.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction' directly contradicts the 'shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT' clause. The added provision effectively negates the exclusivity clause, leading to confusion about what is expected of the consultant.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "In the event of death, requiring the 'CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT' is questionable. Typically, death terminates obligations, and it's unusual to demand repayment for services not rendered due to death. This could be seen as unconscionable or against public policy.",

        "explanation": "This text creates an In-Text Contradiction because the term of the agreement is not clearly defined, with key information such as the number of years, months, and termination date omitted (represented by asterisks). This lack of specific information makes it impossible to determine the actual duration of the contract, leading to ambiguity and potential disputes regarding its validity and enforceability.",

        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" creates an In-Text Contradiction. It restricts the use of the consultant's endorsement to ADAMS GOLF'S internal documentation, conflicting with the broader purpose of the agreement, which is to use the consultant's endorsement in connection with the advertisement and promotion of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. This narrow definition undermines the value of the endorsement and creates uncertainty regarding its intended scope and application.",

        "explanation": "This section creates an In-Text Contradiction with respect to the behavior expected of the CONSULTANT. The initial clause requires the CONSULTANT to conduct himself with due regard to public morals and conventions. However, the \"unless\" clause introduces an exception that seems to incentivize behavior that attracts media attention, even if it might conflict with public morals and conventions. This could be interpreted as condoning behavior that is controversial or scandalous, as long as it benefits ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT.",

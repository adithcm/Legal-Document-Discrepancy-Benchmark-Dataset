        "explanation": "This creates an impossible situation where the company guarantees due dates 'regardless of whether the company receives required materials, documentation, or approvals in a timely fashion from the client'. Delays will not affect the due dates. If the client does not provide the materials on time, it is impossible for the company to meet a deadline, making the guarantee a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that the remaining $3,100 is due 'on completion of the Scope of Work.' The new sentence allows the client to pay the amount at any time before completion, creating an ambiguity as to when the final payment is due, giving two different options. Does that mean that they have to pay it at completion, or at anytime before?",

        "section": "2. Allocation of Charges and Expenses. Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines which expenses are paid by Domini and which are paid by the Trust. It states that Domini will pay the salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who dedicate their time to Domini's affairs, and these salaries will not be considered expenses of the Trust. However, the Trust pays all other operating expenses, including the compensation of Trustees not affiliated with Domini. There is an ambiguity regarding trustees affiliated with Domini in that there is no further mention of expenses that Trustees are incurring. This could be seen as a contradiction, or an omission, in that the responsibilities of Domini paying trustee expenses is ambiguious.",

For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",
        "explanation": "This section is ambigious in that the text states that if Domini services as the Sponsor for less than the whole period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to re-negotiation. There is no indication in how to re-negotiate, who is responsible to re-negotiate, or any terms as to how the re-negotiation should be carried out. Thus the obligations are stated vaguely.",

This Agreement may not be altered or amended, except by an instrument in writing and executed by both parties. This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party. However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This section on the surface makes sense. But after closer inspection, this section has conflicting information with regard to 'termination' of the agreement. The section states that 'This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor.' However, in the very next statement, it is stated that 'However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.'",

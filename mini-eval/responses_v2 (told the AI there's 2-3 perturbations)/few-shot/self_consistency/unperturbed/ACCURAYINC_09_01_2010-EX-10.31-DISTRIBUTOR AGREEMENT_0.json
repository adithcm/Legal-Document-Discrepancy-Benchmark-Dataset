Such determination shall be made in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in  Schedule 2.3.2 attached hereto. If Accuray approves the issuance of a Quote, Accuray shall issue a Quote to Distributor  based on the Product configuration and Services requested by the Customer, including pricing for such Products and  Services as provided in Section 2.2 above. The Quote issued by Accuray in relation to a Customer opportunity shall serve  as the basis of any offer made by Distributor to that Customer and shall remain valid for at least six months (unless earlier  declined by Distributor), and Distributor shall submit an amended Quote request to Accuray in the event adjustments to a  Quote are requested by the Customer. Any such amended Quote request from Distributor shall again be subject to the  Accuray approval process set forth in this Section 2.3.2.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph has conflicting information. The Quote will be based on request from Customer. However, the next sentence says that the Quote issued shall serve as the basis of any offer made by the Distributor to that customer. The change introduces a new approval process for amended quotes, which might conflict with the initially stated process. This ambiguity can cause confusion.",

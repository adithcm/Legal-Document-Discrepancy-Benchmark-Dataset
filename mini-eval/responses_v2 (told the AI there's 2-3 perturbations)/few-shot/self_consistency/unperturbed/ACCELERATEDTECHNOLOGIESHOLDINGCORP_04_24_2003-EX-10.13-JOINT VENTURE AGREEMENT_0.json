(\"PVSS\"), (the \"Parties\" or \"Joint Venturers\" if referred to collectively, or the \"Party\" or Joint Venturer\" if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\"), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states the parties are business associates and not partners, but forms a joint venture, which is a type of partnership. The phrase \"associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture\" is self-contradictory. A joint venture inherently involves a partnership aspect.",

        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This clause implies that capital contributions are optional and require mutual agreement. However, without initial capital contributions, it's unclear how the joint venture would begin operations and cover initial expenses. This omission creates a practical contradiction, as a business typically needs capital to start.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture. The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.\n\nIt is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture shall be made.",
        "explanation": "While stating either Joint Venturer can execute instruments, it immediately restricts this authority by requiring mutual consent for key financial actions (incurring debt, disposing of assets, purchasing items). This creates an inconsistency because, on the one hand, it grants either party the power to execute the instruments; however, it requires both parties to agree in written form. Therefore it creates a contradiction in the text.",

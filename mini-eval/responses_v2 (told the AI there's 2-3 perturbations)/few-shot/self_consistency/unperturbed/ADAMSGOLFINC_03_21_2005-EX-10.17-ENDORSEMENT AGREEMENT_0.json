        "explanation": "The text has redactions represented by '[*****]' and '[* ****]', but states the term is both 'years' and 'months' without specific values for either. This creates an omission, leading to an in-text contradiction because the actual duration of the contract is undefined, making it impossible to determine the end date.",

The parties expressly  agree that CONSULTANT may  permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S  name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past  [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers  with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****].

If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF  [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This entire section is filled with redactions, making it structurally flawed and difficult to understand. The numerous omissions create a contradiction between the exclusivity clauses (4A, 4B, 4C) and this exception, as the exact nature and scope of the permitted endorsement are unclear.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\n\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:",
        "explanation": "This entire section has omissions from the redactions. This makes the definition of what is expected of the consultant ambiguous. The clause begins by stating a minimum number of events, but this has been omitted. Therefore this makes this entire section structurally flawed.",

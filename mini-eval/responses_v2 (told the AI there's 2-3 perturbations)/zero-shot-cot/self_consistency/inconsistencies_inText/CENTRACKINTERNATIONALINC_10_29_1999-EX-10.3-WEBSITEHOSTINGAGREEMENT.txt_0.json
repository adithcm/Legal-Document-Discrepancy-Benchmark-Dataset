        "explanation": "The first sentence states a general responsibility for the customer to pay a monthly fee of $450. The second sentence specifies the payment deadline as the 20th day of each month beginning April 1, 1999. It is unclear if the first sentence refers to the same payment as the second sentence. Also, the statement is very general and does not specify the means or methods of payment. This can lead to a lot of confusion.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence establishes an initial term of six months with automatic renewal. The second sentence states that it will automatically be renewed for one month if no termination notice has been given. The statement is somewhat confusing. It should state 'This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for a period of one month at a time'. The third sentence allows either party to terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice which appears to contradict the second sentence.",

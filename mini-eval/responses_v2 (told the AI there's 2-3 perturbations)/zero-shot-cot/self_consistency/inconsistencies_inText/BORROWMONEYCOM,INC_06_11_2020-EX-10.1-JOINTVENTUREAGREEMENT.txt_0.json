        "explanation": "The phrase \"In Addition to The Total Contributions\" is ambiguous because it is unclear whether the 10% of generated gross revenue is meant to be in addition to the initial $60,000 contribution or in addition to the total of all contributions made by JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go over the life of the joint venture. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over the financial obligations of JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go.",

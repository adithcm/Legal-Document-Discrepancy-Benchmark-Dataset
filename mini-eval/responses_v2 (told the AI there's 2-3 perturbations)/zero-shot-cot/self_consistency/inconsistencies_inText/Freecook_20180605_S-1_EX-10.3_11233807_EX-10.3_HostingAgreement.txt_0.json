Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. <*$p$*> However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "There's a contradiction between the 'best efforts' clause and the guarantee. The initial statement says the company will try to meet the timeframe, but the subsequent sentence guarantees completion within 8 weeks. This creates an inconsistency because 'best efforts' implies a non-binding target, while a 'guarantee' is a firm commitment. This could lead to disputes if the company delivers between 8 and 12 weeks. The phrase 'penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement' makes no sense, because there are no penalties mentioned anywhere else in the agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency. While Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, it also states that due dates are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client. This contradicts the 8 week completion guarantee because it creates multiple scenarios that could delay the company and be an exception to the guarantee, without specifying what the new deadline would be.",

        "explanation": "The surcharge calculation is ambiguous and could lead to disputes. The standard hourly rate of 40 dollars plus 25% would be 50 dollars per hour. The end of the statement indicates that the rate of 50 dollars is to be compared to 100 dollars, and the lower rate used. However, the sentence is unclear about what the standard hourly rate applies to. The term 'standard hourly rate' isn't defined elsewhere and it's unclear if this rate applies to all work outside business hours, or just the 'rush work'.",

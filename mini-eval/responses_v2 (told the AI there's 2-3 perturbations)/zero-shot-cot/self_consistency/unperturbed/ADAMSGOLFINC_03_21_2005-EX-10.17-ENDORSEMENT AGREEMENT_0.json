        "section": "The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract states that the agreement begins on September 1, 2004. However, in section 18, it also mentions the term of this Agreement, from September 1, 2004 through [*****]. This means that there is conflicting information within the contract itself, specifically because the end date is not specified. This can lead to issues regarding the duration of the contract.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause creates a potential legal contradiction. While it's reasonable to terminate the agreement if the Consultant is unable to perform due to death or disability, requiring the estate to repay ADAMS GOLF for the 'unperformed' portion could be challenged, especially in the case of death. It's questionable whether an estate can be compelled to repay amounts already paid, especially considering the circumstances of death, which constitutes an unforeseen event. Furthermore, the language 'unable to play tour golf at all' is vague. Does this refer to a permanent or temporary inability?",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "The text is ambiguous because it does not define the term 'material breach.' It is vague and could be interpreted in different ways by either party, especially when different state laws have different definitions of 'material breach'. This can lead to conflict because one party might think a breach has occurred, while the other party does not. Furthermore, the clause states that the Consultant shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. This can cause a legal issue if the consultant has already performed services for ADAMS GOLF, but ADAMS GOLF terminates the contract. It is unclear whether the consultant would be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for services already rendered.",

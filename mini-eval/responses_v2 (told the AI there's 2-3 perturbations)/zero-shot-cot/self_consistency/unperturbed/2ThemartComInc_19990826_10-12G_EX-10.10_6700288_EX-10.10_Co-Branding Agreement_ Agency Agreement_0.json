        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. <*$p$*>A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The text indicates that the agreement may be renewed for successive one-year terms by mutual written agreement. Then the text continues that if a party doesn't provide a notice of renewal 30 days before the agreements term is up, it will automatically be renewed for another year. These contradict each other because the first part indicates that both parties have to come to an agreement while the second part indicates that it will be automatically renewed, even if both parties don't come to an agreement. This creates ambiguity in the renewal process and makes it hard to know how the agreement is properly renewed.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2  [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], <*$p$*>2.4  [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "Section 8.2 allows for immediate termination of the agreement if certain conditions are met. In subsection (a), it states that a party can terminate if the other party breaches the agreement and fails to fix it within 60 days. However, the subsequent clause states that termination can occur immediately as provided in sections 2.2, 2.4, and 12.4. This is a contradiction because subsection (a) provides a 60-day cure period for a breach, while the other sections it references allow for immediate termination. The ambiguity creates a problem for which termination clause to follow.",

In addition, <*$p$*>2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content.

        "explanation": "The first sentence of this section states that each party will indemnify the other for claims arising from their acts or omissions, to the extent the indemnified party is deemed a principal of the indemnifying party. This creates a contingency on the indemnification obligation, requiring a principal-agent relationship. However, the subsequent sentences state that 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow for claims arising from 2TheMart Content, and i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart for claims arising from i-Escrow Content and the Services. This language does not include the contingency that the indemnified party is deemed a principal of the indemnifying party. This creates a conflict between the general indemnification provision and the specific indemnification provisions, as the specific provisions do not require a principal-agent relationship.",

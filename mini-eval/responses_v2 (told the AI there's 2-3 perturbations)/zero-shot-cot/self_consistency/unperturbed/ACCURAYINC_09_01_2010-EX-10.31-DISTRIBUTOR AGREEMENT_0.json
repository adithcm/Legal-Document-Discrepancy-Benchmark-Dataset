The  current price list for Products and Services effective as of the Effective Date will be provided to Distributor  contemporaneously with the delivery of this fully executed Agreement to Distributor. Such price lists will be subject to  change from time to time in Accuray's sole discretion, and Accuray shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide  Distributor with updated pricing on a regular basis, provided that pricing included in a Quote delivered by Accuray to  Distributor shall reflect Accuray's current up-to-date pricing unless otherwise agreed. Updated price lists shall not apply to  valid Quotes issued by Accuray and subject to acceptance by Distributor prior to the effective date of such updated price lists.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"unless otherwise agreed\" creates ambiguity. It is unclear who needs to agree, what form the agreement should take (written or oral), and what the scope of such agreement would be. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over which price list applies if a different price was informally discussed but not formally documented.",

To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order,  which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either  accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of  such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall  be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized  representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the  terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be  bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor  shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor  may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's  reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray  shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra  insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the  need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray,  if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if  a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses  required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was  October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and  perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory  clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not  to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of  the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's  acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray  does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation  (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall  Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation  thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any  software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or  representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE  FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND  REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES  ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.",
        "explanation": "The warranty period is defined as one year after installation or 18 months after shipment, whichever is shorter. However, the definition of \"Installation\" relies on Accuray's acceptance test procedure. This creates a potential conflict if Accuray delays or refuses to perform the acceptance test. If Accuray does not perform the installation, the distributor is only required to notify Accuray within 10 days following the installation, but that does not guarantee that Accuray will then perform the required acceptance test.",

        "explanation": "The term 'in all material respects' is ambiguous. It is unclear what constitutes a \"material\" breach of Siemens' Code of Conduct and who determines whether a breach is material. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether Accuray has complied with this obligation.",

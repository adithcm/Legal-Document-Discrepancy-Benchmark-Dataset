        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it does not define what happens if mutual consent is not reached. Does this mean the joint venture cannot proceed or does it imply there is another method that must be used? This lack of clarity creates a potential contradiction because other sections of the agreement assume the joint venture will be funded in some way to cover expenses and operations. How is that supposed to work?",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "This section initially states that neither joint venturer will receive compensation for services. However, it then mentions reimbursement for 'direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses.' This creates an ambiguity, because some expenses, such as office space, could be construed as indirect compensation if one venturer is providing those resources, which contradicts the initial statement of no compensation.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture shall be made.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'except as provided for below' is an omission and creates an in-text contradiction because there is no additional information below to explain what is to be expected when liability is incurred. This also contradicts the following clause about incurring liability, which does not mention any other exceptions.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT'S \u201cENDORSEMENT\u201d means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is overly restrictive. It defines the endorsement as the right to use the consultant's name only, explicitly excluding other common elements of an endorsement such as likeness or image. This severely limits the value of the endorsement to Adams Golf and seems impractical for effective marketing. In a real-world scenario, an endorsement typically involves more than just a name.",

(It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "The agreement allows the consultant to use any golf clubs he desires, including those from competitors. It is written that he is 'encouraged' to use mandatory products 'whenever feasible'. This is contradictory because 'mandatory' implies a strict requirement, yet the consultant has the discretion to use competitor's products. The last sentence creates further ambiguity in that the consultant may endorse other clubs.",

        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting language regarding the minimum number of tournaments. It first states the consultant must achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum number of events, and then states if the consultant plays in less than that number of events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event. There is an ambiguity as to what events count towards this total. It should be specified whether or not the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games are to be included. If included, the text should read 'which shall include the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games'.",

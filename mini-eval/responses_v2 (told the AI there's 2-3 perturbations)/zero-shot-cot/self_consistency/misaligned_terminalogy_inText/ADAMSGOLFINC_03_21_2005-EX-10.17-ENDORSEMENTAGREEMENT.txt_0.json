        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is very narrow, limiting its use to ADAMS GOLF'S internal documentation. However, subsequent sections (e.g., Sections 3, 10, 11, 20) discuss the use of CONSULTANT'S endorsement in advertising and promotion of the PRODUCT, which are external activities, creating a contradiction. If the endorsement is only for internal documentation, the sections relating to public advertising would not make sense.",

        "explanation": "Section 3 grants ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right to use CONSULTANT'S endorsement for advertising and promotion. However, Section 2.A defines endorsement as only for internal documentation. This creates a direct contradiction. The term 'endorsement' is not consistently defined.",

(It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section mandates the exclusive use of ADAMS GOLF's MANDATORY PRODUCT while simultaneously allowing the use of other manufacturers' clubs (specifically mentioning a putter). It then restricts the consultant from endorsing those other clubs and/or putter. This creates a potential contradiction because if the consultant is using another company's putter, it will be seen as an endorsement whether he wants it or not. This is because he is using it in a professional setting.",

        "explanation": "This clause includes a conditional exception that potentially undermines the initial requirement for CONSULTANT to conduct himself with due regard to public morals and conventions. This creates an ambiguity because it is not clear what actions, although violating public morals, would be deemed beneficial to ADAMS GOLF's product enough to justify the behavior. This could lead to disputes about whether a specific action falls under the exception.",

However, it says that ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.

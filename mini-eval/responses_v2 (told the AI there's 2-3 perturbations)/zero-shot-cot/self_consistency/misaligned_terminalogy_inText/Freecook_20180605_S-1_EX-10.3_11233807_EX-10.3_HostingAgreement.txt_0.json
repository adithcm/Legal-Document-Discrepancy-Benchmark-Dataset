        "explanation": "The section specifies that the website design and development will be in accordance with the Scope of Work attached as Exhibit A. However, later in the document, changes to this Scope of Work are addressed in Section 1(a) regarding Change Orders. This creates an initial impression of a fixed agreement, which is then undermined by the possibility of modifications, leading to ambiguity about the extent of the original agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section defines the project timeline. However, it also states that the due dates are subject to delay if the company does not receive require materials. By stating this, this can cause a contradiction in the project timeline if the project requires outside entities to work on it which could cause a set back in the project timeline.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"on completion of the Scope of Work\" is ambiguous. It doesn't define what constitutes completion. Does it mean when the website is fully functional, or when all tasks listed in Exhibit A are technically finished even if the Client isn't satisfied? This lack of clarity can lead to disputes about when the final payment is due.",

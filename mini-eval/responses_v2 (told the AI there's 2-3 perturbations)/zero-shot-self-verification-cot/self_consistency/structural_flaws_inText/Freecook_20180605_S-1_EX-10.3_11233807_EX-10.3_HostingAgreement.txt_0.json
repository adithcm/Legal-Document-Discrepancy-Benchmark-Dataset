Delays will not affect the due dates.",
        "explanation": "This statement is contradictory and unreasonable. It asserts that the company guarantees all due dates, irrespective of whether the client provides the necessary materials, documentation, or approvals on time. This is illogical because the company's ability to meet deadlines is directly dependent on the client's cooperation. It's not possible for the company to guarantee deadlines if the client is delaying the process by not providing what's needed. It would be considered an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a direct contradiction. The first sentence states that the company is obligated to continue providing customer service and cannot alter or cease it. However, the following sentence immediately contradicts this by stating that the company can alter or cease providing customer service at any time at its sole discretion without any liability. This creates confusion about the actual obligation of the company regarding customer service, and is an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The payment terms are contradictory. While it initially states that the remaining $3,100 is due 'on completion of the Scope of Work,' the subsequent sentence allows the client to pay the remaining amount at any time or in multiple installments before the Scope of Work is completed. This creates ambiguity regarding the agreed-upon payment schedule. This introduces a contradiction within the text of the payment terms.",

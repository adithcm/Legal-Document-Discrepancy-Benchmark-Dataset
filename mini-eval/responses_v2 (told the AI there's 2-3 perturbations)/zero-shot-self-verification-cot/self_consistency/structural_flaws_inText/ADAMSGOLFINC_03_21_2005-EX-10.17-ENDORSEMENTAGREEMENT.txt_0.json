This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is ambiguous because it states that ADAMS GOLF has the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name only, which excludes the use of the consultant's fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. The right to use the CONSULTANT'S name is useless without the ability to use other identifying characteristics. This creates a contradiction in the contract.",

In the first part of the section, it states that the consultant may use any golf clubs he desires, including those from competitors, but he is encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. The second part of the section states that the consultant may play clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter. The contradiction is that the consultant may endorse a competitor's product, while the agreement is for the consultant to endorse ADAMS GOLF products only.",

        "explanation": "The clause stating the purpose of the venture and then allowing BorrowMoney.com, inc. to change it at their discretion creates a contradiction. The agreement intends to establish a joint venture with a specific purpose, but this is undermined by giving one member unilateral power to alter that purpose. This contradicts the principle of a joint venture, which requires mutual agreement on core aspects like the venture's purpose. JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go has no say in any changes to the purpose of the venture.",

        "explanation": "The description of BorrowMoney.com, inc.'s capital contribution includes \"specified Description of duty*\" which is a reference to their duties. This conflates capital contribution with duties, creating misalignment. A capital contribution is typically an asset or money invested in the venture, while duties are separate obligations to perform certain tasks. The phrase \"Includingspecified Description of duty\" blurs the lines between the two, making it unclear what portion of the $3,500,000 USD value is attributed to the office space versus the assigned duties.

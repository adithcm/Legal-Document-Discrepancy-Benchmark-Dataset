        "explanation": "The text states that i-on will maintain the Hosted Site continuously, 24/7, but then provides an exception for maintenance. The maintenance period is vaguely defined as 'reasonable' and during specific hours.  The ambiguity lies in defining what 'reasonable' maintenance entails (duration, frequency) and creates uncertainty as to how much downtime is acceptable. This could lead to disputes if the Customer deems the maintenance excessive, even if i-on considers it 'reasonable'.",

        "explanation": "The text mentions a separate Service Level Agreement (SLA) for specific connectivity details. If the SLA is not attached or clearly referenced, it creates an omission. The main agreement is incomplete without the SLA, especially concerning critical aspects like uptime guarantees, bandwidth, and support response times. Without the SLA, the 'connectivity to the Internet' clause is too vague and unenforceable, leading to potential disputes about the level of service provided.",

        "explanation": "The contract specifies that failure to pay the recurring monthly fees by the 5th of the month will result in interruption or discontinuation of services. However, it doesn't clarify the procedure for interruption or discontinuation. This lack of clarity introduces ambiguity. It is not specified if the customer will get a notice before discontinuation, how long the interruption period may be, or if there is a restoral fee after the payment is made.",

        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the allocation of charges and expenses between Domini and the Trust.  The initial sentence states Domini pays salaries of Trust personnel who devote time to Domini's affairs. However, the subsequent list specifies the Trust pays 'compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor.' This creates an ambiguity. If a Trustee dedicates time to Domini, who pays their compensation?  The statement contradicts itself by assigning payment responsibility to both parties under potentially overlapping circumstances. The contradiction arises because the initial blanket statement about Domini paying salaries isn't properly qualified or reconciled with the Trust's responsibility for paying unaffiliated Trustee compensation.",

        "explanation": "This section attempts to clarify the Sponsor's (Domini's) limited responsibilities.  It states Domini is not responsible for asset management, investment advice, distribution of shares, or functions of other specified agents. However, Section 1 states, 'Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust.'  The term 'management services' in Section 1, even with the Trustee's oversight, could be interpreted to include some aspects of asset management or investment advice, which Section 1 explicitly disclaims.  While Section 1 tries to limit the Sponsor's direct involvement, the broad language of 'management services' creates a conflict with the later disclaimer. This ambiguity makes it unclear precisely what management services the Sponsor *can* provide without overlapping with the prohibited areas.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "The contract does not initially define the fee that shall be paid. The contract mentions a mutually agreed upon fee, but it does not provide the exact figure or formula for calculating the fee. Then the contract mentions that if Domini serves as a sponsor for less than the whole period, the new amount will be determined by mutual agreement. This is an omission because it fails to specify how the compensation will be calculated during the full term.",

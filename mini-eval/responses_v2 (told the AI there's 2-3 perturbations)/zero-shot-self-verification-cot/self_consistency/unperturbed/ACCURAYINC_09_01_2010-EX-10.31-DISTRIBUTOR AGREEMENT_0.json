        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order,  which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either  accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of  such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall  be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized  representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the  terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be  bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.  The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address:\n\nAccuray Incorporated\nATTN: Contracts Administration\n1310 Chesapeake Terrace\nSunnyvale, CA 94089\nMain: (408) 716-4600\nFax: (408) 789-4205\nEmail: Orders@accuray.com",
        "explanation": "This section states that Accuray's failure to approve or disapprove a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, it also states that each purchase shall be accomplished, and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. The contradiction arises because the first statement implies a passive disapproval (no action equals rejection), while the second implies an active acceptance (execution by Accuray). This discrepancy creates uncertainty about the actual requirements for a Purchase Order to be considered valid, creating an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor  shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor  may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's  reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray  shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra  insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the  need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray,  if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if  a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses  required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was  October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The last two sentences of Section 4.1.2 provide contradictory conditions regarding who bears the supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery. It states that Accuray is responsible if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the example given contradicts this by stating that if the Purchase Order was submitted on June 1 with a requested delivery date of December 1, Accuray bears the expenses. While December 1 is six months after June 1, the phrase \"at least\" means that it can be more, not equal to. If that's the case, the example should be December 2 or later. This contradiction creates uncertainty as to when Accuray is responsible for the supplementary shipping costs.",

        "section": "4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and  perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory  clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not  to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of  the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's  acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray  does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation  (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall  Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation  thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor\nshall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any  software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or  representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE  FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND  REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES  ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.",
        "explanation": "This section defines the warranty period as one year following installation, but not exceeding 18 months following shipment. This creates a potential ambiguity. If installation takes longer than 6 months after shipment, the warranty period is effectively reduced. If the purpose of radiosurgery requires the machine to be in the best condition and working properly, this creates a legal contradiction in cases of malfunction, especially if the product is not functioning as expected due to shipping issues but still meets the minimum specs. If the system takes longer than 6 months after shipment, and breaks down, Accuray will not be responsible.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  <*$p$*>In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This creates an inconsistency in the contract regarding renewal. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement 30 days before expiration, but then immediately states that if no notice is given, it will automatically renew, contradicting the need for a mutual written agreement.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.  In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content.  In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow<*$p$*>Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"Content and or the Services provided to Customers\" is vague and misaligned, making it unclear whether i-Escrow is indemnifying 2TheMart against claims arising solely from i-Escrow Content, solely from the Services, or from a combination of both. The 'and or' construction introduces ambiguity, creating a potential dispute over the scope of indemnification.",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, <*$p$*>at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence is a structural flaw and does not make sense. The sentence should state that the other party can give notice to i-Escrow and not the other way around.",

        "explanation": "The termination date is not specified. This is problematic because the agreement length is defined by years and months from a start date. Without the full term, it's unclear when the agreement ends, leading to uncertainty about obligations and rights.",

        "explanation": "While this section grants ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right to use the consultant's endorsement, the term 'endorsement' is not well-defined and is vague. This could lead to disputes over the extent to which Adams Golf can use the consultant's image and likeness. The problem is that there is some ambiguity in the text because the definition provided earlier is too vague.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section defines the conditions for termination due to a breach of contract by either party. It is clearly stated that if the consultant breaches the agreement, they will have to repay Adams Golf, however it is not clear what happens if Adams Golf breaches the contract.",

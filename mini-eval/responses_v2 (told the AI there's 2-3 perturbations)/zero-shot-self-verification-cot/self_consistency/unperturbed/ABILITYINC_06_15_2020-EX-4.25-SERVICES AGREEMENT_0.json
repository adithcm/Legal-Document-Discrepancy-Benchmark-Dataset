        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This clause mandates that Provider Representatives (employees or contractors) exclusively serve the Recipient, prohibiting them from offering services to the Provider itself or other clients. This could create an in-text contradiction if the Provider has limited staff and relies on these same representatives for its own internal operations or other contractual obligations. The Provider might be unable to fulfill its own business needs, leading to conflicting obligations. It also needs to be determined whether Provider Representatives are considered employees or contractors. If they are contractors, this could be a structural flaw in legal terms.",

        "explanation": "This sentence contains structural flaws in text. The use of the word 'Agreement' twice in one sentence is incorrect. 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.' is incorrect and should be reworded for the agreement to make sense.",

        "explanation": "The contract states that the provider shall allow the Recipient to use something at no cost until December 31, 2021. This can be considered an omission in text, as the text does not explain what '[ * * * ]' refers to, leaving it up to interpretation. This also means that the agreement does not make sense as a whole and creates structural flaws.",

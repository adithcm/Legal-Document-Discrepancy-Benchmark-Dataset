        "section": "Duties of the Sponsor. Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor may perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust, which shall include without limitation: (a) maintaining office facilities (which may be in the office of Domini or an affiliate) and furnishing clerical services necessary for maintaining the organization of the Trust and for performing the oversight, administrative and management functions herein set forth; (b) arranging, if desired by the Trust, for directors, officers or employees of the Sponsor to serve as Trustees, officers or agents of the Trust if duly elected or appointed to such positions and subject to their individual consent and to any limitations imposed by law; (c) supervising the overall administration of the Trust, including the updating of corporate organizational documents, and the negotiation of contracts and fees with and the monitoring and coordinating of performance and billings of the Trust's transfer agent, shareholder servicing agents (if any), custodian, administrator, subadministrator (if any) and other independent contractors or agents; (d) overseeing (with advice of the Trust's counsel) the preparation of and, if applicable, filing all documents required for compliance by the Trust with applicable laws and regulations (including state \"blue sky\" laws and regulations), including registration statements on Form N-1A, prospectuses and statements of additional information, or similar forms, as applicable, semi-annual and annual reports to shareholders and proxy statements, and reviewing tax returns; (e) preparation of agendas and supporting documents for and minutes of meetings of Trustees, committees of Trustees and preparation of notices, proxy statements and minutes of meetings of shareholders; (f) arranging for maintenance of books and records of the Trust; (g) maintaining telephone coverage to respond to shareholder inquiries regarding matters to which this Agreement pertains to which the transfer agent is unable to respond; (h) providing reports and assistance regarding each series' compliance with securities and tax laws and each series' investment objectives; (i) arranging for dissemination of yield and other performance information to newspapers and tracking services; (j) arranging for and preparing annual renewals for fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance coverage; (k) developing a budget for the Trust, establishing the rate of expense accruals and arranging for the payment of all fixed and management expenses; and (l) answering questions from the general public, the media and investors in the Trust regarding (i) the securities holdings of the Trust; (ii) any limits in which the Trust invests; (iii) the social investment philosophy of the Trust; and (iv) the proxy voting philosophy and shareholder activism philosophy of the Trust. <*$p$*>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"Notwithstanding the foregoing\" introduces a clause that directly contradicts the previously listed duties of the Sponsor. The preceding section outlines various administrative and oversight responsibilities of the Sponsor. However, this phrase asserts that the Sponsor is *not* responsible for managing the Trust's assets, rendering investment advice, or distributing shares. The contradiction arises because some of the listed duties, such as (h) providing reports and assistance regarding each series' compliance with securities laws and investment objectives, and (k) developing a budget for the Trust, could be interpreted as relating to or influencing the management of the Trust's assets or investment decisions. This creates an ambiguity about the extent of the Sponsor's responsibilities and oversight. Furthermore, the statement that the Sponsor is fully responsible, yet simultaneously has no responsibility, creates an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "Allocation of Charges and Expenses. Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. <*$p$*>The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The contract specifies that Domini pays the salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who spend time on Domini's or its affiliates' affairs, and these salaries are not considered Trust expenses. However, it also stipulates that the Trust covers *all* operating expenses, including Trustee compensation (specifically those *not* affiliated with Domini). An omission exists regarding how compensation is handled for Trustees, officers, and agents who dedicate time to *both* the Trust and Domini/its affiliates. It's unclear whether the Trust would cover a portion of their compensation or if Domini would be solely responsible, creating a potential point of dispute. This creates a contradiction because the first sentence implies Domini covers certain salaries entirely, while the second implies the Trust covers all operating expenses, which could include some salaries. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about financial responsibility.",

As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction. The initial statement asserts the Sponsor's liability for any error of judgment, mistake of law, or any act/omission related to its duties. However, the subsequent clause immediately creates an exception, stating the Sponsor is *not* liable except in cases of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard. This contradiction makes it unclear under what circumstances the Sponsor is truly liable. The broad initial statement suggests a high degree of accountability, while the exception significantly narrows the scope of liability, making the initial statement almost meaningless. The phrase states that the Sponsor shall be liable but then in the same sentence states that they may not be liable.",

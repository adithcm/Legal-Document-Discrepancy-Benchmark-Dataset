        "explanation": "The contract states that the website design and development should follow Exhibit A, yet the exhibit is mainly about 'Development of design of Free Cook Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3'. This means that the exhibit is not only focused on the 'design' part of the website, but also on the 'development'. The contract is therefore misaligned as it does not account for the development part of the website.",

        "explanation": "The section provides a specific timeline for the project (February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018). However, it introduces ambiguity by stating that these dates are 'subject to delay' based on various factors dependent on the Client. This creates an inconsistency because, while a project timeline is defined, it is simultaneously undermined by conditions that could easily render it invalid. It is not clear what would happen in case of such delay. What would the repercussions be?",

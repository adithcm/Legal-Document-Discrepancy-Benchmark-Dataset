This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.",
        "explanation": "The contract states the agreement will last for six months, but then it says it will be automatically renewed for one or more one-month periods. This is contradictory because it doesn't specify the limit for the amount of renewals, so there is no end date for the contract to be over if the company keeps renewing for one-month periods.",

        "explanation": "The contract says i-on will maintain the operation of the hosted site continuously, but then states an exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer. This is contradictory, because if the Hosting Computer has to do maintanence, the site is not able to run continuously.",

        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency regarding the payment schedule. It first states that the customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fee of $450. Then, it specifies that the payment is due by the 20th of each month beginning April 1, 1999. This seems contradictory because, logically, if the contract is dated April 6, 1999, the first payment should be prorated or addressed differently, not simply due by the 20th of April. There is no explanation of how the payment for April is handled, leading to confusion.",

        "section": "The Customer acknowledges that the Internet is an unreliable, unsecured, and error-prone network and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any interruptions in service to the Hosted Site or inability for users to reach or effectively use the Hosted Site that arises outside the scope of i-on's responsibilities as explicitly described in this Agreement. The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit i-on's liability for service interruptions and data loss, but it introduces ambiguity. It states that the Customer agrees to hold i-on harmless for interruptions and data loss 'outside the scope of i-on's responsibilities'. However, it also states that the Customer agrees to hold i-on harmless for data loss even with mirrored storage and backups, provided i-on maintains 'reasonable steps'. The term 'reasonable steps' is not defined, creating ambiguity. It is unclear what would constitute reasonable steps and what level of negligence would still be covered under this clause. This could lead to disputes about whether i-on fulfilled its responsibilities.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the renewal and termination clauses, but it creates a potential contradiction. The first sentence states that the agreement automatically renews for one-month periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least five days before the end of the term. However, the second sentence allows either party to terminate the agreement 'without cause' at any time with 30 days' written notice. This creates a contradiction: if a party can terminate with 30 days' notice, the 5-day non-renewal notice becomes somewhat irrelevant. For example, a party could give a 30-day termination notice 6 days before the end of the month, effectively overriding the need to give a 5-day non-renewal notice.",

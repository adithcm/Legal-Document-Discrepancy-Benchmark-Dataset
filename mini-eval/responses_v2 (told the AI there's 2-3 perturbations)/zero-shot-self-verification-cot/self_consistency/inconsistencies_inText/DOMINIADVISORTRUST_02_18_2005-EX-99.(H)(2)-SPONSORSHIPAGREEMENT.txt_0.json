        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The section contains an inconsistency regarding who is responsible for legal counsel fees. The first part of the section states \"The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.\" The section later adds, \"Other operating expenses include but are not limited to...\" implying that the list is exhaustive.  Legal counsel fees are operating expenses. This contradicts the earlier statement that Domini will cover legal counsel fees, creating confusion about which party is ultimately responsible for those expenses. The phrase 'but are not limited to' implies that the trust has to pay for additional fees not mentioned, and may also include legal fees.",

        "explanation": "In section 1, subsection (d) the sponsor is responsible for \"overseeing (with advice of the Trust's counsel) the preparation of and, if applicable, filing all documents required for compliance by the Trust with applicable laws and regulations (including state \"blue sky\" laws and regulations), including registration statements on Form N-1A, prospectuses and statements of additional information, or similar forms, as applicable, semi-annual and annual reports to shareholders and proxy statements, and reviewing tax returns.\" However, this section states that the Sponsor \"shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series\". This creates an internal inconsistency. Overseeing the preparation of filings, especially those related to compliance, could arguably be interpreted as involving some level of 'management of the Trust's assets' or 'rendering of investment advice,' particularly regarding compliance with investment-related regulations. This is because ensuring the accuracy and completeness of these documents could influence investment decisions.",

        "explanation": "This section allows for termination of the agreement with a penalty of $10,000 by either party. The inclusion of a penalty for termination after providing written notice introduces ambiguity. Typically, termination clauses specify a notice period, and termination within that period is permissible. The presence of a penalty suggests a cost associated with early termination, but the contract fails to define clearly under what circumstances the penalty applies, especially if the terminating party adheres to the 60-day notice requirement. Does the penalty apply even after the 60-day notice period is served?",

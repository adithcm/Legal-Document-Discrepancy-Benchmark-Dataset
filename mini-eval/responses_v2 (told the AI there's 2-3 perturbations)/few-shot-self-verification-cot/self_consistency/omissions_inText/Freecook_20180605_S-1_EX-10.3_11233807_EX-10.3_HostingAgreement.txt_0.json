        "explanation": "There is a calculation error within the term dates. If the project starts on February 8, 2018 and goes for 12 weeks, it ends on May 3, 2018, which is inaccurate. Counting 12 weeks from February 8th would mean the project ends closer to May 1st, so May 3rd may be incorrect, leading to inconsistency in project deadline.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines the payment terms but there is a structural flaw here as it only mentions prepayment and payment at the end, leaving out when the rest of the money will be paid. This raises a question regarding when the rest of the money is due, and can lead to disputes.",

        "explanation": "The contract states that the company's business hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. UTC +2. This clause, although stating their availability, doesn't define what is considered 'normal business hours', creating ambiguity. The lack of a clear definition could result in future disagreements concerning the responsiveness of the company to urgent requests and the application of rush work surcharges.",

        "section": "11. The Managers will jointly decide major issues concerning the Venture. Where Managers are unable to reach agreement in deciding major issues, approval by a majority vote of the Managers will be required.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency regarding how major decisions are made. It initially states that the managers must 'jointly decide' major issues, implying unanimous agreement. However, the subsequent sentence allows for 'a majority vote of the Managers' when they cannot reach an agreement. This creates an ambiguity. Does 'jointly decide' mean a consensus is strictly required initially, or does it mean the managers should simply attempt to reach an agreement before resorting to a majority vote? The lack of clarity can lead to conflict regarding decision-making processes.",

Liability Insurance\nThe Venture may acquire insurance on behalf of any Member, employee, agent or other person engaged in the business interest of the Venture against any liability asserted against them or incurred by them while acting in good faith on behalf of the Venture.",
        "explanation": "These sections present a structural flaw in the text. Section 50 defines the circumstances under which a member is liable, explicitly stating liability for 'gross negligence or willful misconduct.' Section 51 then discusses liability insurance, stating it can be acquired for those acting 'in good faith on behalf of the Venture.' The logical inconsistency exists here: one section refers to actions done in bad faith or willful misconduct, and the other talks of action done in good faith. The sections do not flow properly and it would be ideal if they were in separate areas.",

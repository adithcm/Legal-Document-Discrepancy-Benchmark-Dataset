        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section contains inconsistent terminology. It first states that Domini will cover legal counsel fees. However, it then states that other operating expenses will be paid by the Trust. It also includes a long list of items that the Trust is responsibile for, which makes it seem like the Trust is ultimately responsible for legal counsel fees.",

        "explanation": "This section indicates contradictory clauses. It mentions 'termination at any time' followed by 'not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party' which means that it can't actually be terminated at anytime because there needs to be a 60 day written notice given. The payment of a penalty of $10,000 seems arbitrary.",

        "explanation": "This section attempts to absolve Domini of responsibility for its subcontractors, which is a structural flaw. Generally, in legal agreements, the primary contractor has vicarious liability for its subcontractors. This clause is oddly structured and might not hold up in court, as it attempts to circumvent standard legal principles. The structural problem arises from the contradiction between Domini having obligations to the Trust, being allowed to subcontract those obligations, and then disclaiming responsibility for the subcontractors' actions, which could lead to structural issues. If Domini is not responsible for acts/omissions of subcontractors, it might lead to inadequate safeguards which could be a legal issue.",

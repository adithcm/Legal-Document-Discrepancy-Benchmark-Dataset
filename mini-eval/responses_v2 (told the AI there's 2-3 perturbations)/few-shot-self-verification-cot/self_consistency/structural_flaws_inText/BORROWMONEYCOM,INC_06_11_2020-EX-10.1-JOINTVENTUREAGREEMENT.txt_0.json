        "explanation": "The initial part of this clause defines the purpose of the joint venture. However, the final sentence gives BorrowMoney.com, inc. the unilateral right to change the purpose at any time. This contradicts the concept of a *joint* venture, where major strategic decisions should ideally be made jointly, or at least with some consultation or consideration of all members' interests. This effectively nullifies any agreement on the purpose, leading to operational uncertainty. It provides BorrowMoney.com, inc. with too much power, potentially allowing them to change the purpose in a way that is detrimental to JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go.",

        "explanation": "This clause outlines the duties of each member. However, the description of BorrowMoney.com, inc.'s duties lacks specificity. The phrase \"HTML code, build, deploy and maintain all technical aspect requirements\" is too vague. What constitutes \"technical aspect requirements\"? This ambiguity creates uncertainty and could lead to disputes later on if the parties disagree on the scope of BorrowMoney.com, inc.'s responsibilities. More detail or an exhibit outlining these requirements is necessary. Also, note the asterisk at the beginning of the description is unusual and potentially a typographical error, but it contributes to the general lack of clarity.",

        "explanation": "This clause allows BorrowMoney.com, inc. to unilaterally amend the agreement, regardless of JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go's objections. This directly contradicts the principle of a 'joint' venture, as it gives disproportionate power to one member. Amendments should require the consent of all members to ensure a fair balance of power and protect the interests of all parties. This creates a power imbalance and makes JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go vulnerable to amendments that could harm their interests. Such a provision might even be viewed negatively by a court because it so overwhelmingly favors one party.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that Domini's responsibility for a subcontractor's actions is limited to the extent of the subcontractor's liability insurance. However, it also states that Domini isn't responsible for acts outside the scope of contracted services. This creates an ambiguity. If a subcontractor acts negligently *within* the scope but causes damages exceeding their insurance, it's unclear if Domini has further liability. This is because the initial limitation on liability based on insurance seems to contradict the later statement that Domini is not responsible for the acts outside the scope of the contracted services. Is it only acts *outside* the scope that are not Domini's problem, or are *all* acts, regardless of scope, limited to the subcontractor's insurance?",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a direct contradiction. It first states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty' by either party with 60 days' notice. The very next sentence then introduces a penalty for the Sponsor if they terminate within the first year. This is a clear inconsistency, as the contract initially states no penalty exists, but immediately introduces one under specific circumstances. It's unclear whether a penalty should be applied.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'which shall include without limitation' followed by a list of specific duties creates a potential ambiguity. While seemingly intending to broaden the Sponsor's responsibilities beyond the enumerated list, it could be interpreted to mean that only services *similar* to those listed are within the Sponsor's responsibility. If the Trust requests an entirely different kind of service (e.g., something unrelated to administration or management), it's unclear if the Sponsor is obligated to provide it under this clause. The 'without limitation' could be argued to only apply to the *scope* of the listed duties, not to entirely different types of duties.",

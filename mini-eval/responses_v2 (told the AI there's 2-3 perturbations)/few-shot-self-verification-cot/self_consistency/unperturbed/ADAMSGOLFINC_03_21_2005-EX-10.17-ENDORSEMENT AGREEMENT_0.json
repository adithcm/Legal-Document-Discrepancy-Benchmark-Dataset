        "explanation": "The contract states that the agreement starts on September 1, 2004, and lasts for a certain number of years and months, however the actual termination date has been redacted and filed separately with the commission. This creates an issue as the actual end date is unknown making the duration of the contract ambiguous. This also contradicts the concept of a fixed term mentioned earlier in the same section.",

The parties expressly  agree that CONSULTANT may  permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S  name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past  [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers  with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If  [*****] use of CONSULTANT  varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF  [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to carve out an exception to the exclusivity clause, allowing the consultant to endorse and play certain products ([*****]). However, the redacted nature of the product and the conditions surrounding its endorsement (e.g., \"executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past advertising practice\") create significant ambiguity. It's unclear what constitutes \"past practice\" or what actions the consultant must take to \"remedy the situation\" if the use varies. This creates the potential for disputes regarding the scope of the exception.",

Any and all payments required to be made to SAG or AFTRA or any other organization having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT'S services hereunder, shall be the sole responsibility of CONSULTANT.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements. However, it also places the sole responsibility for all payments required by these agreements on the consultant. This could create a contradiction if the collective bargaining agreements themselves specify that the employer (Adams Golf) has certain payment obligations. It is possible SAG/AFTRA has requirements for Adams Golf. By stating that the consultant is solely responsible, it creates a potential conflict with SAG/AFTRA requirements.",

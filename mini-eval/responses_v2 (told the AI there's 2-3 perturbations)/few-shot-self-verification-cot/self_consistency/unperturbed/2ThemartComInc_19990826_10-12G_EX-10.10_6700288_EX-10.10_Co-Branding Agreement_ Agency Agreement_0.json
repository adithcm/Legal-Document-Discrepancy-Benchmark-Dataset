        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section allows either party to terminate the agreement if an SOW is not agreed upon within 2 months. However, section 2.3 states if the launch date hasn't occurred within 4 months, either party may terminate. Because the launch date is dependent on the SOW, this creates a contradiction because the contract allows either party to pull out at 2 months and then have four months.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.4 states that i-Escrow can place banner advertising on the co-branded site at the discretion of 2TheMart, but that i-Escrow will get all ad revenue. Contradictory to this statement, the same section then states that i-Escrow must exclude companies 2TheMart would like to exclude. This creates an ambiguity because now 2TheMart is making a condition to I-Escrow's revenue, because they can cut certain companies and thus cause I-Escrow to lose ad revenue.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The text contradicts itself. It first states that the agreement may be renewed by mutual written agreement, implying active consent is needed from both parties. However, it then states that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal, the agreement automatically renews. This implies the agreement will be renewed even without mutual consent.",

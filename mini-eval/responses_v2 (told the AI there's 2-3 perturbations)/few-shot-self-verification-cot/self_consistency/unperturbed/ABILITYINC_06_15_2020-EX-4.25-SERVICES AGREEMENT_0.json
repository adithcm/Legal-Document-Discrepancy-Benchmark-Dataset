        "section": "1.2 Standard of Service. (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "The statement that 'Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient' contradicts the general principle of independent contractor status outlined in 1.2(d). While Recipient has a valid interest in the qualifications of personnel, requiring consent for *any* change effectively gives Recipient control over Provider's staffing decisions, blurring the lines of an independent contractor relationship. This could be interpreted as an employer-employee relationship, potentially leading to legal challenges regarding benefits, liability, and taxes under various labor laws, such as those governing misclassification of employees.",

(a) As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee\" is ambiguous. 'Actual cost' isn't defined. It's unclear if this includes overhead (rent, utilities), internal labor costs, management fees, or just direct expenses. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes. It also isn't defined what costs fall under Out-of-Pocket costs, it is ambiguous in text what is and is not included.",

        "explanation": "This sentence has structural flaws and does not make sense. The sentnece says, 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.' There is a 'be' in place of 'is' and there is a second 'agreement' in the middle of the sentnece, which does not make sense.",

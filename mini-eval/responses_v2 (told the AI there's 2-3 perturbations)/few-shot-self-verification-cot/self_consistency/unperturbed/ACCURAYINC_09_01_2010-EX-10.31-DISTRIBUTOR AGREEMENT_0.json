        "section": "Distributor shall not be subject to any minimum purchase requirements, but shall agree to the annual sales targets set forth in Schedule 2.5(d)(i)(2) of the Strategic Alliance Agreement and to using its customary standard sales processes, including, without limitation, the MTA process, with respect to sales of Systems.",
        "explanation": "This is contradictory. The text specifies that the distributor is not subject to any minimum purchase requirements. However, the second portion of the text suggests they are subjected to annual sales targets. These two statements contradict each other.",

        "section": "All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a contradiction regarding who bears the cost of expedited shipping. The original text states that supplementary shipping costs for meeting deadlines at least six months out are borne by Accuray, whereas the modified text states that all expedited delivery costs are always borne by the distributor, creating uncertainty and conflict.",

Distributor shall receive a commission in the amount specified in Exhibit A hereto for any Service Agreement entered into by Accuray with Customer pursuant to Section 4.8.",
        "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding service agreement compensation. The original states distributor receives a commission as specified in Exhibit A, the new text states distributor will only receive 15% of gross revenues. As Exhibit A is the determinant factor, the commission is ambiguous and not easily enforceable.",

        "section": "Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The section states that the Sponsor provides 'oversight, administrative, and management services as requested by the Trust' and lists 'maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust' as examples. However, the subsequent 'Notwithstanding the foregoing' clause states the Sponsor is *not* responsible for 'the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice'. This creates an in-text contradiction. 'Management services' is a broad term. It's unclear whether the initial 'management services' excludes asset management or whether the second clause is unnecessarily limiting the Sponsor's duties if it overlaps with the Trust's initial request and the Board's direction. This can be an issue if the Trust requests general 'management services' that could be construed as including asset management, leading to disputes.",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section details the allocation of charges and expenses. It explicitly states that Domini is responsible for paying the salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini or its affiliates. The wording implies all trustees are affiliated with Domini, which doesn't make sense as the section specifically states that 'compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor' is paid by the Trust. This suggests that some trustees are paid by Domini and others are paid by the Trust, and it's likely this is not the intention. This may lead to potential confusion as who is actually responsible for payment.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "While the first sentence states that the Trust shall pay Domini a fee that is 'mutually agreed upon', the agreement doesn't specify how this 'mutually agreed upon fee' is initially determined, or what mechanisms are in place for adjusting the fee over time. The second sentence, in isolation, addresses the pro-rata calculation for partial periods but doesn't clarify the initial fee determination. The fact that there is no clarification makes the agreement vauge.",

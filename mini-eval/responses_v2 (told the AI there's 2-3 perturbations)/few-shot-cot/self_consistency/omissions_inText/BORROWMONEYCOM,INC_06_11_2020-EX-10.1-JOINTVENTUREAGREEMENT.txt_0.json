Within the limits of the Purpose of the Venture and the terms of this Agreement, the Managers, acting jointly, will have full authority to bind the Members in all matters relating to the direction, control and management of the Venture. Conduct and actions of the Managers will be dictated by policy and procedure established by the Members. Authority to bind the Venture in contract or in any third party business relation lies exclusively with the Managers, acting jointly.",
        "explanation": "The statement 'Conduct and actions of the Managers will be dictated by policy and procedure established by the Members' contradicts the prior statement that 'the Managers, acting jointly, will have full authority to bind the Members in all matters relating to the direction, control and management of the Venture'. If the Managers have full authority, their actions should not be entirely dictated by the Members' policy and procedures. This creates a ambiguity about the degree of independence afforded to the Managers. It's unclear who has the ultimate decision-making power and how much leeway the managers have.",

        "explanation": "The specific duties assigned to BorrowMoney.com, Inc. are described using vague language, such as stating they need to provide HTML code, build, deploy and maintain all technical aspect requirements. What is HTML code? This is missing the mark as code is a concept, not a defined element. The details surrounding these duties are ill-defined, making it difficult to enforce or verify whether BorrowMoney.com, Inc. fulfills its obligations. In other words, the description is too high level to hold BorrowMoney.com, Inc. accountable.",

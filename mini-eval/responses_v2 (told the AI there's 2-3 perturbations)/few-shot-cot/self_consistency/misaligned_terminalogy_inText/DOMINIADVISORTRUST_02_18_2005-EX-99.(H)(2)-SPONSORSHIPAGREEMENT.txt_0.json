        "section": "1. Duties of the Sponsor. Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor may perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust, which shall include without limitation: ... (l) answering questions from the general public, the media and investors in the Trust regarding (i) the securities holdings of the Trust; (ii) any limits in which the Trust invests; (iii) the social investment philosophy of the Trust; and (iv) the proxy voting philosophy and shareholder activism philosophy of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction between the first part of Section 1 and the 'Notwithstanding' clause. The first part outlines the Sponsor's duties, including answering questions about the Trust's securities holdings, investment limits, and philosophies. The 'Notwithstanding' clause then states that the Sponsor is *not* responsible for the management of the Trust's assets, rendering investment advice, or the distribution of shares. Answering detailed questions about securities holdings and investment limits arguably falls under providing 'investment advice' or 'supervision with respect thereto', creating a contradictory obligation. The sponsor is required to disseminate information, but is prohibited from taking responsiblity for its management.",

        "section": "2. Allocation of Charges and Expenses. Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees;...",
        "explanation": "This section allocates expenses, stating Domini pays the salaries of personnel dedicated to Domini's/affiliates' affairs, and the Trust pays its operating expenses, including fees to the Sponsor *and* compensation to unaffiliated Trustees. The contradiction stems from the lack of clarity regarding *who* are the Trust's Trustees. It is not explicitly clear what 'unaffiliated' means, and if 'affiliated' trustees (whose salaries Domini pays) can still be deemed to have their compensation paid by the trust. This ambiguity can lead to disputes regarding who bears the cost of specific individuals serving as trustees.",

The Sponsor shall be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder. As used in this Section 4, the term 'Sponsor' shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
        "explanation": "The section first states that 'The Sponsor *shall* be liable for any error of judgment', then immediately contradicts this by stating 'except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence'. While seemingly intended to limit liability to cases of extreme misconduct, the initial statement of liability for *any* error is directly contradicted by the exceptions. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty in determining the scope of the Sponsor's liability for errors. While exceptions exist, the original term of being liable for any judgement is vague.",

        "explanation": "This section defines the payment terms. It states the total cost is $5,000, with a $1,900 prepayment and the remaining $3,100 due on completion.  This is straightforward and doesn't inherently contain an omission. However, it omits details about the specific milestones or criteria that define 'completion of the Scope of Work'.  This omission could lead to disputes about when the final payment is due, if the client and company disagree on when the project is actually finished.",

        "explanation": "While seemingly innocuous, this clause omits crucial considerations related to data privacy and consent, particularly concerning the use of client information in marketing materials.  Specifically, it fails to address the necessity of obtaining *explicit* consent from the client for using their feedback and identifying details in marketing materials.  In many jurisdictions (including those covered by GDPR and other privacy laws), simply receiving unsolicited positive feedback does not automatically grant the company the right to publish it as a testimonial with the client's name or identifying information.  The clause should explicitly state that the company will seek and obtain *documented consent* from the client before using any feedback or identifying information for marketing purposes. Without this, the clause presents a significant risk of violating privacy regulations.",

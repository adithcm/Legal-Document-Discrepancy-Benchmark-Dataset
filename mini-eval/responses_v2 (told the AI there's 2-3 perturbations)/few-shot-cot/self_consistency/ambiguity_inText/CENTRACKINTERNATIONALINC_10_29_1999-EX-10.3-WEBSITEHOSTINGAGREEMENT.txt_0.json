        "explanation": "This clause allows i-on to perform maintenance without prior notice. This is a structural flaw in the text because it does not make sense. The text should give a warning that will occur before the scheduled time of maintenance, this would allow the customer to properly prepare and get their needed materials beforehand.",

        "explanation": "This clause states that the customer has 30 days to pay the invoice. The lack of a late fee specified for payments made after the due date creates an omission in legal terms. This omission creates a legal loophole because the lack of late fee allows for ambiguity on what the repercussions are.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The agreement language allows for automatic renewal for one-month periods with 15 days' notice of non-renewal, but also allows termination without cause with 30 days' notice. The contradiction arises because if a party waits until 15 days before the term ends to provide 30 days' notice of termination, the agreement will automatically renew for another month, potentially obligating the party for an additional month of service that they intended to terminate. It also creates an ambiguity in the text because of the automatic renewal clause. The two statements contradict each other.",

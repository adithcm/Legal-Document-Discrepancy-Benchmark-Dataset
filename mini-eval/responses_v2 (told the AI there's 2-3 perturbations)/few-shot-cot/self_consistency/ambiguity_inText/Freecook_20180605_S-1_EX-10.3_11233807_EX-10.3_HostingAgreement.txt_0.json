        "explanation": "This statement is an overreach and potentially unenforceable. While parties can agree to deadlines, unforeseen circumstances (illness, natural disasters, etc.) can legitimately cause delays. A blanket statement prohibiting *any* delay is unrealistic and could lead to legal disputes if a reasonable delay occurs. It contradicts the possibility of 'Change Orders' causing delays as well.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'Client may be asked' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear if the surcharge is mandatory if work is done outside business hours due to the client's actions. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes about whether the surcharge is owed. The term is not precisely defined.",

        "explanation": "This clause essentially renders the obligation to provide Customer Service meaningless. Allowing the Company to unilaterally cease providing the agreed-upon Customer Service 'at any time' and without liability contradicts the idea of a binding agreement. It undermines the Client's expected benefit from the contract.",

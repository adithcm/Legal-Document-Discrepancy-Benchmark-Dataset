        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This clause attempts to make the Sponsor liable even for errors of judgment or mistakes of law *without* any finding of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard. This is a very high standard of liability. Investment advisors are generally only liable for gross negligence or intentional misconduct, not simple errors. Therefore, this section is a misaligned legal term.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction in text, since there is a penalty required when terminating the agreement. However, the document states that termination may occur at any time. The two terms do not align with each other. The document also fails to specify the penalty that should be paid when the agreement is terminated before the three years have passed, and so it is missing essential information.",

        "explanation": "This subcontracting clause attempts to limit Domini's liability for the actions of its subcontractors to only cases of gross negligence. Generally, the primary contractor (Domini) is responsible for the actions of its subcontractors. While a contract can attempt to alter this, such a provision is often disfavored and may be unenforceable or require specific disclosures/approvals depending on the jurisdiction and type of activity. By reducing Domini's liability to gross negligence, it misaligns with the expected legal standard, especially given Domini's oversight and management responsibilities. Domini could use the trust's money to pay a third party and would not be liable for slight negligence. This misaligns legal terminology.",

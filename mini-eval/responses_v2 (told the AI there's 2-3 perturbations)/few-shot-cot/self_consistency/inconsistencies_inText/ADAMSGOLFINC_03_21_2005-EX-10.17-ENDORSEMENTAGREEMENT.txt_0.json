        "explanation": "The contract states that the term is for a certain number of years and months, commencing on September 1, 2004, but the termination date is left blank. This omission makes it impossible to determine the actual length of the contract. This introduces ambiguity regarding the duration of the agreement and creates uncertainty about when the parties' obligations end.",

However, the phrase '[*****] in [*****] ads' is vague and undefined. Without knowing what type of advertisements this refers to, it's unclear to what extent the consultant is exempt from wearing Adams Golf apparel.",

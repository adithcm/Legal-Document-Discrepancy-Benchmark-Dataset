        "explanation": "This section states that the Trust pays all operating expenses except for Sponsor fees, compensation of unaffiliated Trustees, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. This creates a contradiction as it's unclear which legal counsel fees Domini is responsible for, or if the Trust and Domini is paying for the same legal counsel fees.",

        "explanation": "This section describes Termination, but the penalty to terminate is $10,000, thus it does not make sense to add the phrase 'at any time', the clause is not sturctured properly.",

While Domini may subcontract obligations, absolving them of responsibility for the subcontractor's actions might conflict with fiduciary duties or regulatory requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940. If a subcontractor's negligence or willful misconduct harms the Trust, this clause could be challenged as an attempt to circumvent legal responsibilities to investors.",

Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The section states that the company will use its best efforts to deliver the website within the 12-week timeframe, but then it guarantees completion within 8 weeks. The use of 'best efforts' suggests a reasonable endeavor, while 'guarantees completion' suggests an absolute promise. If the company only needs to use its best efforts to meet the 12-week deadline, why guarantee completion in 8 weeks. This is contradictory as the 8-week guarantee negates the 'best efforts' clause for the extended 12-week period. It creates a discrepancy regarding the actual commitment to deliver the website within the initially stated timeframe.",

        "explanation": "The total of milestone payments ($1,000 + $1,000 + $1,100 = $3,100) matches the statement that the client shall pay the remaining $3,100 but is worded in such a manner that the dates or schedule when such payments should occur is omitted. Without stating the exact dates, the client may be confused as to when such payments should occur. This also allows the company to ask for payments whenever and there is no specific date when the client should remit the payment.",

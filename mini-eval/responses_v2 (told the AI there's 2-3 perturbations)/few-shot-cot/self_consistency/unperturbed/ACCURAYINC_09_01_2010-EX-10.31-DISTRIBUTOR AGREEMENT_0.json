        "explanation": "This statement indicates that confidential information has been removed and filed separately with the SEC. Throughout the document, there are placeholders where information is missing (indicated by the asterisks). This means that certain critical pieces of information within the contract are not visible, leading to potential misinterpretations or disputes over the meaning and scope of the complete agreement. Especially as the contract is about discounts on products and services.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Distributor' includes Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party granted distribution rights by Siemens. This is too broad. What are the conditions, limitations, or requirements for Siemens to grant distribution rights to a Third Party under this agreement? What happens if Siemens ends up granting the distribution rights to more than one Third Party? This creates ambiguity regarding which entity is actually responsible and liable as the 'Distributor' at any given time. If they were to perform in a way that does not align with the other parties, what actions can be taken?",

        "section": "Exhibit A\nDISTRIBUTOR DISCOUNTS ON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES",
        "explanation": "Several volume discounts are referenced in Exhibit A. However, the actual discount values are missing and indicated as {*****}. This means the financial terms of the agreement cannot be fully determined from the document itself. The lack of clear discount amounts constitutes a structural flaw because it undermines the enforceability and predictability of pricing. This is a major structural flaw because it removes an essential piece of information from the document, making it difficult to determine the financial responsibilities of the parties involved. The omission creates an ambiguity that is not easily resolved.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM.  The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section details the term of the agreement and its renewal. It initially states that the agreement is for one year following the launch date. However, it then introduces conflicting conditions regarding renewal. While it mentions that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, it also states that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days before the expiration date, the agreement is automatically renewed for another year. This automatic renewal clause contradicts the requirement for mutual written agreement, creating uncertainty about the actual renewal process. It is ambiguous whether the contract requires explicit mutual agreement to renew, or whether lack of explicit non-renewal is enough.",

        "explanation": "This section initially states that all rights granted in the agreement are not sublicenseable, transferable, or assignable. However, it then provides exceptions that create a contradiction. While either party can use a third-party web host, effectively sublicensing a part of their responsibilities, it also states that 2TheMart may grant sublicenses to companies it has a business relationship with to the extent that 2TheMart Content is visible from such company's web-site through a link or other means. This permission for 2TheMart to grant sublicenses directly contradicts the initial statement that rights granted herein are not sublicenseable, leading to ambiguity and potential disputes over intellectual property rights.",

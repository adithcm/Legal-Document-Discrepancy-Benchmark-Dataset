        "explanation": "The redacted portions of this section create ambiguity in the contract term. Without knowing the number of years and months, it's impossible to determine the actual end date of the agreement. This makes it difficult to enforce provisions tied to the term's length, such as compensation, performance bonuses, and termination clauses. The lack of a defined termination date renders the term length uncertain and subject to dispute.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly  agree that CONSULTANT may  permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S  name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past  [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers  with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If  [*****] use of CONSULTANT  varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF  [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "The numerous redactions within this paragraph introduce a significant ambiguity regarding the Consultant's endorsement of a non-competing product (likely another brand). The redacted sections make it unclear what specific rights and limitations exist. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over permitted advertising practices, logo placement, and the potential replacement of the non-competing endorsement. The absence of detail prevents a clear understanding of the Consultant's obligations and the extent of ADAMS GOLF's control over the endorsements.",

        "section": "During  the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT  shall make himself available on not more than [*****]  days for television and radio commercials, photo shoots, modeling and  promotional appearances compatible with CONSULTANT'S  own practice, play and personal time requirements. Said activities shall  be directly related to the promotion of ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT. ADAMS GOLF  shall  reimburse CONSULTANT  for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances. Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation.",
        "explanation": "The redaction of the number of days CONSULTANT is required to be available for promotional appearances creates ambiguity. Without knowing the maximum number of days, there's uncertainty regarding the extent of CONSULTANT's commitment. This makes it difficult to enforce ADAMS GOLF's rights to promotional appearances and could lead to disputes over scheduling and availability. It also creates the potential for ADAMS GOLF to demand an unreasonable number of appearances, placing an undue burden on CONSULTANT, or for CONSULTANT to avoid appearances by claiming an exceeded limit.",

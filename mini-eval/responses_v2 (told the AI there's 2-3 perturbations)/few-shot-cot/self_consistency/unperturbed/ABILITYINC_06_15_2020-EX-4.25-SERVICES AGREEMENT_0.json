(c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "The language 'Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services' is vague and does not set any definitive requirements of the Provider, making the quality of services ambiguous. However, this contradicts the following sentences that the 'Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient' and that the 'Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient'. The Provider Representatives is also vague as it states 'each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto', yet Exhibit A has [ * * * ].",

(a) As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "The condition states 'Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee', suggesting that the basis for payment is the actual costs. However, the lack of a clear definition or mechanism for auditing or verifying these 'actual costs' introduces ambiguity. Furthermore, no cap is put on the 'actual costs'.",

If Provider is prevented from or delayed in complying, either totally or in part, with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement by reason of fire, flood, storm, strike, lockout or other labor trouble or shortage, delays by unaffiliated suppliers or carriers, shortages of fuel, power, raw materials or components, any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand, seizure or requirement of any governmental authority, riot, civil commotion, war, rebellion, acts of terrorism, nuclear accident or other causes beyond the reasonable control of Provider, or acts, omissions, or delays in acting by any governmental or military authority or Recipient (each, a \"Force Majeure\"), then upon written notice to Recipient, the Services affected by the Force Majeure (the \"Affected Services\") and/or other requirements of this Agreement will be suspended during the period of such Force Majeure and Provider will have no liability to Recipient or any other party in connection with such Affected Services. If the Force Majeure in question prevails for a continuous period in excess of three months after the date on which the Force Majeure begins, Provider shall be entitled to give notice to Recipient to terminate the Affected Services. The notice to terminate must specify the termination date, which must be not less than ten (10) days after the date on which the notice to terminate is given. Once a notice to terminate has been validly given, the Affected Services will terminate on the termination date set out in the notice. Neither Party shall have any liability to the other in respect of termination of the Affected Services due to Force Majeure, but rights and liabilities which have accrued prior to termination shall subsist.",
        "explanation": "The Force Majeure clause lists 'acts, omissions, or delays in acting by any governmental or military authority or Recipient' as events excusing Provider's performance. Including 'Recipient's acts, omissions, or delays' creates a contradiction because it allows the Provider to avoid their duties under the contract. This means that if the Recipient delays a payment by even a day, Provider is not reliable.",

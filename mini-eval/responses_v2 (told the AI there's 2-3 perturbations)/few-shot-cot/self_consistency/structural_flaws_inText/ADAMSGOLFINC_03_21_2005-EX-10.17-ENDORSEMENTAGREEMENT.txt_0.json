        "section": "TERM OF CONTRACT The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The term of the contract is not clearly defined because parts of it are redacted (indicated by the asterisks). This makes it impossible to determine the actual duration of the contract. This introduces uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the agreement's duration, which is essential for determining the parties' obligations and rights over time. The redacted portions, representing the exact number of years, months, and the termination date, are crucial for establishing a clear and enforceable term.",

        "explanation": "Section 3 contradicts the definition of ENDORSEMENT in Section 2A. Section 2A defines ENDORSEMENT as the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding other identifying characteristics. Section 3 grants Adams Golf the right to use the CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the advertising and promotion of the product. Because the definition of endorsement in 2A includes the consultant's name only, section 3's grant is inherently ambigious.",

        "explanation": "This paragraph presents an internal contradiction. It states the consultant has the sole discretion to use any golf clubs, including competitors' clubs, but also encourages using the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. This creates ambiguity as MANDATORY PRODUCT are defined in the contract and CONSULTANT is expected to exclusively play/use in all Champions/Senior Professional Golf Association (SPGA) and Professional Golf Association (PGA) events at all times.",

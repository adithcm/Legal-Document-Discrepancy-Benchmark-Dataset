        "explanation": "The statement that the due dates are guaranteed by the Company *regardless* of whether the company receives required materials from the client is contradictory and structurally flawed. Project timelines are almost always dependent on client input, and this clause removes that dependency, making it nonsensical.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a direct contradiction. It first states that the Company *is obligated* to continue providing customer service, and *may not* alter or cease providing the service. Then, in the very next sentence, it states that the Company *may* alter or cease providing the same customer service *at its sole discretion*. This renders the customer service obligation unenforceable.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "Section 1 states that the Sponsor will provide oversight, administrative and management services, which seemingly include management of the Trust's assets. However, the second half of the section seems to contradict this by stating that the Sponsor shall not be responsible for the management of the Trust's assets or rendering investment advice. This creates internal ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence states the fee will be mutually agreed upon, implying a concrete number. The second sentence, 'If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement,' contradicts the original statement by stating that the amount can be determined by mutual agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section limits the Sponsor's liability, except in cases of 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence'. These terms are not defined anywhere else in the agreement. The absence of a clear definition for these terms makes it difficult to determine the Sponsor's liability, creating a legal ambiguity.",

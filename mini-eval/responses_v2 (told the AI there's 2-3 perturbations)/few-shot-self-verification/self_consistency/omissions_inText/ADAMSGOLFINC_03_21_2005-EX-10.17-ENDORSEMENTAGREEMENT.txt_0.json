This creates an in-text contradiction because the commencement date is specified, but the duration and termination date are obscured, making it impossible to determine the actual length of the agreement without further information.",

If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section allows the CONSULTANT to endorse and play a product of another company different than ADAMS GOLF. This is vague and unspecific because the name of the company is redacted. The paragraph directly contradicts paragraphs 4A, 4B, and 4C as it relates to endorsement.",

The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section states that in the event of death or inability to play golf, ADAMS GOLF may terminate the agreement and the CONSULTANT will repay ADAMS GOLF for the services not performed. The contradiction lies with the fact that there is no longer an agreement, and repayment should not be enforced. Furthermore, the estate may be unable to repay due to lack of funds.",

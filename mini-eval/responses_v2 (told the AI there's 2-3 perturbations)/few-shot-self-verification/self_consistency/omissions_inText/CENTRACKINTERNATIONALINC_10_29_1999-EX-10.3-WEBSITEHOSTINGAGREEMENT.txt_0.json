        "explanation": "The phrase 'best efforts' is ambiguous and doesn't provide a concrete standard for i-on's maintenance schedule. It contradicts the promise of continuous operation by not defining what constitutes 'reasonable' maintenance or what recourse the Customer has if maintenance extends beyond the specified hours.  This creates uncertainty regarding i-on's obligations.",

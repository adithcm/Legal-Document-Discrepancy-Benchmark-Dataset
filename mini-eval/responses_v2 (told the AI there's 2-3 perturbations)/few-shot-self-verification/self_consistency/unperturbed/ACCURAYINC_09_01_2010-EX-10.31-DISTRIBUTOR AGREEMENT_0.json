        "section": "12.7.2.  During the Term, Accuray shall comply, in all material respects, with Siemens' Code of Conduct, attached hereto as Exhibit B (the \"Code of Conduct\"). Siemens shall give Accuray written notice of any change to its Code of Conduct as soon as reasonably practicable.\n12.7.3.  During the Term, Distributor shall comply, in all material respects, with the Business Conduct Guidelines of Siemens and all other Siemens internal regulations and guidelines.",
        "explanation": "Sections 12.7.2 and 12.7.3 contain contradictory instructions. In 12.7.2, Accuray is instructed to follow Siemens' Code of Conduct, whereas 12.7.3 indicates that the Distributor (Siemens) must adhere to Siemens' Business Conduct Guidelines as well as other internal regulations. It is unclear whether 'Code of Conduct' in 12.7.2 and 'Business Conduct Guidelines' in 12.7.3 are the same document, or if these are different compliance standards. This discrepancy could create confusion regarding which specific guidelines each party is obligated to follow, potentially leading to compliance issues.",

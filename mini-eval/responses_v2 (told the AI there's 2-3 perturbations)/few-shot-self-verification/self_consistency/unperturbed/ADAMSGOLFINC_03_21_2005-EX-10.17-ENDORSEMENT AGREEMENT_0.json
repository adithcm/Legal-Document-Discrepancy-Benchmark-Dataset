        "explanation": "The term of the contract is not clearly defined due to the redactions. While it states the start date, the exact duration in years and months, and the termination date are missing. This ambiguity regarding the contract's length makes it difficult to determine the obligations and benefits of each party over time.",

(It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section is confusing because it says, 'CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs', but the amount of clubs is omitted. By omitting this figure, it is not clear how many clubs can be played, which creates uncertainty for both parites.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The minimum number of tournaments the consultant must play is redacted, creating ambiguity. Additionally, the language refers to repaying Adams Golf 'an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year,' where the redacted portion refers to the 'satisfactory number of events'. Because this text is omitted it is not clear how much money needs to be paid back, or what the agreement even is.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM.  The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This creates an internal contradiction. The paragraph states that the agreement may be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then states that if notice is not given the term is automatically renewed. These two statements contradict each other as mutual agreement would not be needed if it is automatically renewed, causing uncertainty about the renewal of this contract.",

Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference.  However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This section is structurally flawed and doesn't make sense. It is not clear what it means, as section 9 obligations regarding indemnification should be limited, creating confusion.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This section is structurally flawed and does not make sense. The first part specifies that if the agreement conflicts with the escrow law, the escrow law prevails. However, the second part states the parties will use their best efforts to resolve the conflict, which does not make sense if the escrow law already prevails.",

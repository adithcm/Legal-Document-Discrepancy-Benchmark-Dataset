        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that Provider Representatives should be dedicated to providing services solely to the Recipient. However, Section 1.1(a) states that Provider agrees to respond to any reasonable request by the Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient. If Provider's Representatives are dedicated to the Recipient, it is unclear how Provider will provide any additional services to the Recipient. In addition, because the original clause states that Provider Representatives shall solely provide the services to the Recipient, but the revised version removes the \"solely\" portion of the statement, this implies that Provider's representatives can also provide additional services to other companies, which contradicts with Section 1.1(a).",

        "section": "Provider shall be entitled to give notice to Recipient to terminate the Affected Services. The notice to terminate must specify the termination date, which must be not less than ten (10) days after the date on which the notice to terminate is given. Once a notice to terminate has been validly given, the Affected Services will terminate on the termination date set out in the notice. Neither Party shall have any liability to the other in respect of termination of the Affected Services due to Force Majeure, but rights and liabilities which have accrued prior to termination shall subsist.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that Provider will not have any liability to Recipient in connection with the Affected Services. The clause, 'but rights and liabilities which have accrued prior to termination shall subsist' is vague and open to interpretation. This leaves ambiguity as to what rights and liabilities exist that would persist. In addition, by adding 'but rights and liabilities which have accrued prior to termination shall subsist' to the original text, this implies that the Provider might have liabilities after termination.",

        "explanation": "By removing the 'except as provided in Exhibit A' clause, this creates ambiguity and uncertainty. The original text seems to carve out exceptions to the assignment of rights in Exhibit A, but the revised text unconditionally assigns all rights to the Recipient. This could lead to conflict if Exhibit A has terms that contradict this assignment.",

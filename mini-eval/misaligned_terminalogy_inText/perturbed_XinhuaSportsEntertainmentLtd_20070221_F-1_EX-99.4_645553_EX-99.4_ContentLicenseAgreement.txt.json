                "explanation": "The contract defines CEIS and XFN as \"PARTIES\" collectively. Changing this definition to \"ENTITIES\" creates confusion as to whether the subsequent mentions of \"PARTY\" refer to the previously defined term or if the singular use of “PARTY” refers to something undefined. This could affect how obligations are interpreted for each organization.",

Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Association hereby appoint Capital Resources as their agent to advise and assist the Company and the Association with the Company's sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public Offerings.

Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Association hereby appoint Capital Resources as their advisor to counsel and assist the Company and the Association with the Company's sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public Offerings.

                "explanation": "Changing 'agent' to 'advisor' and 'appointment' to 'position' creates uncertainty about Capital Resources' exact role and responsibilities. An agent generally has more authority to act on behalf of the company, while an advisor provides guidance. This could lead to disputes over the scope of Capital Resources' duties and liabilities.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall receive' to 'may receive' makes the compensation discretionary, potentially conflicting with the intention of guaranteeing payment for services rendered. Similarly, substituting 'marketing fee' and 'management fee' with 'marketing commission' and 'success fee' alters the nature of these payments. A commission implies a percentage-based payment dependent on specific sales, while a fee could cover broader marketing activities. A success fee is contingent on achievement, adding another layer of contingency to the payment terms, thus it creates uncertainty for enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'best efforts' which is a legally recognized term with a high bar for performance. Replacing it with 'reasonable efforts' lowers the standard and introduces ambiguity. In addition, 'approved' is replaced with 'sanctioned' and 'effective' is replaced with 'authorized', which are non-standard, thus further create confusion.",

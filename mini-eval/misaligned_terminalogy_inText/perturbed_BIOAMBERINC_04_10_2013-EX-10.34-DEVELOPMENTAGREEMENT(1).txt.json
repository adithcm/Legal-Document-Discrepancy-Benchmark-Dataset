Bioamber and Cargill shall be referred to individually as \"Party\" and collectively as \"Parties\", as required by text.",

                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity because 'Bioamber' is not explicitly included in the collective term 'Parties'. This contradicts later sections that assume both are included under 'Parties'.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'the Parties' to 'Cargill,' the condition for modifying milestone target dates becomes unclear and one-sided. It introduces an ambiguity whether Bioamber also has to agree or if Cargill can unilaterally set the target dates.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Disclosing Party' to 'originator' only for the ownership sentence creates a contradiction. The requirement for the Receiving Party to destroy 'Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party' becomes disconnected from the ownership clause, potentially leading to disputes about what needs to be destroyed.",

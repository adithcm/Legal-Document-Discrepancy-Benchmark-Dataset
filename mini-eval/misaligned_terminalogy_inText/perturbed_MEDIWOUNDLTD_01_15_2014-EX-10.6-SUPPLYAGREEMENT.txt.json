                "original_text": "4.2.3 MediWound shall make payment for each Bromelain SP batch that was supplied by CBC on a [***] days basis as of the date of delivery of the applicable batch at MediWound, provided that MediWound has provided CBC with an Acceptance Batch Notice for such purchased batch pursuant to Section 6.4. Payment for each purchase batch shall be effected by MediWound by swift to a bank account designated by CBC, or by other requested method as agreed between the parties.",
                "changed_text": "4.2.3 MediWound will attempt to remit funds for each Bromelain SP lot supplied by CBC within [***] days from the date of delivery to MediWound, assuming MediWound provided CBC with a Batch Acceptance Notification as per Section 6.4. The purchaser shall effect payment for each purchased batch via swift transfer to a CBC-designated bank account, or via another mutually agreed upon method.",
                "explanation": "The original text makes payment within a specific timeframe an obligation ('shall make payment'). The modified text softens this, using 'will attempt to remit funds,' introducing ambiguity and making timely payment less enforceable. Also using Purchaser instead of MediWound",

                "changed_text": "5.1 Without impacting CBC's guarantees herein, CBC and MediWound will strive to collaborate so the CBC plant meets needed criteria for the production, packaging, and dispatch of Bromelain SP, aligning with defined Specifications, GACP (Good Agricultural and Collection Practice), and cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) norms, ISO 22000, and pertinent legal guidelines.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear obligation for CBC and MediWound to work together to meet standards ('shall work together'). The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'will strive to collaborate,' making it less certain and enforceable. Also using plant instead of facility and norms instead of standards.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains strong obligations using 'undertakes to purchase' and 'undertakes to furnish'. The modified text uses 'intends to procure' and 'agrees to provide', which introduces ambiguity and makes CBC's supply obligation less definitive and legally binding. The word deliver is also replaced with ship, making it misaligned.",

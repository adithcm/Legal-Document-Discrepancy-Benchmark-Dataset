In their place, the Parties agree to the following (and Section 2.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended as needed to implement the following): Sanofi Pasteur agrees to purchase and ADMA to manufacture [***] Batches of Product, which Batches will be produced over a period from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a detailed supply plan provided to ADMA by Sanofi Pasteur (the \"Updated Supply Plan\") that describes the agreed-upon timing for production of such Batches of Product, which supply plan is made an integral part hereof and shall be binding on the Parties. Prices for such [***] Batches of Product shall be in accordance with Section 3.2 of the Agreement (as amended in Amendment #2).",

                "explanation": "Changing 'supply plan' to 'distribution plan' introduces ambiguity. Is ADMA responsible for manufacturing according to a supply plan, or distributing according to a distribution plan? This creates uncertainty about ADMA's obligations, particularly if the plans differ.",

                "explanation": "Using 'supply' and 'deliver' interchangeably, while they are similar, creates uncertainty in the context of manufacturing. Does 'failure to provide' include manufacturing failures, or only failures to physically deliver completed products? This could lead to disputes over termination rights.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Customer Information' to 'Confidential Information' and 'customer' to 'consumer' creates an inconsistency.

                "explanation": "Substituting 'Shareholder(s)' with 'Investor(s)' introduces a subtle but critical ambiguity. While generally referring to the same concept, 'Shareholder' has a precise legal meaning related to ownership, while 'Investor' is more general. This could lead to disputes regarding the scope of information to be provided, particularly if some investors are not technically shareholders. Later references to 'Shareholder' add to the confusion.",

                "original_text": "This is a managed hosting agreement between AstroNutrition.com and deep systems.  The effective term is 12 months beginning March 1, 2005 and ending February 28, 2006.",
                "changed_text": "This is a managed hosting agreement between AstroNutrition.com and deep systems. The contract duration is 12 months beginning March 1, 2005 and expiring February 28, 2006.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'effective term' with 'contract duration' introduces subtle ambiguity. While seemingly synonymous, 'effective term' implies legally binding dates, whereas 'contract duration' could be interpreted as the intended, but not necessarily fixed, period, creating uncertainty about the contract's enforceability if services extend beyond the 'contract duration'.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'regular off-site backups' to 'periodic data archiving' introduces a contradiction. 'Regular off-site backups' implies consistent, scheduled backups stored remotely. 'Periodic data archiving' suggests infrequent, potentially on-site storage, without clear timelines or methods, which is ambiguous and conflicting.",

                "changed_text": "Includes a 99 percent service availability target.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'server uptime guarantee' to 'service availability target' introduces a contradiction regarding performance commitment. 'Uptime guarantee' suggests a firm, legally enforceable promise of server availability. In contrast, 'service availability target' reads more like an aspirational goal, potentially diminishing Deep System's liability for outages, making it less certain what the remedy for failing to meet the service availability is.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'RESELLER' to 'DISTRIBUTOR' introduces ambiguity. It is now unclear if Reseller and Distributor are intended to be the same entity, creating confusion regarding obligations and rights assigned to each role within the agreement. The agreement never defines that Reseller and Distributor are the same, it is also important to consider it creates conflict later when the document specifically uses the word Reseller",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Reseller' to 'Vendor' introduces uncertainty about payment obligations post-termination. If the 'Vendor' isn't explicitly defined as the 'Reseller' or 'Distributor,' it can be argued that MediaNet Group Technologies isn't obligated to pay for sales made by the original Reseller, creating a financial contradiction. It is also important to consider that MediaNet Group Technologies has the obligation to remit payment to Reseller, not vendor. What happens to the funds after the contract ends? Who receives those funds.",

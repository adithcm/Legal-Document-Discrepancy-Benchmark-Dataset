                "changed_text": "1.4 Licensed Patent(s)\n\nThe term \"Licensed Patent\" or \"Licensed Patents\" means specific patents issued only in the United States. These include inventor's certificates and reissued patents. They are based on inventions made after the Effective Date, covered in applications filed after the Effective Date, and owned solely by SONY, where SONY can grant licenses without additional payments to third parties. These patents would be infringed by supplying SRAM Products. \"Licensed Patents\" does not include the Transferred Patents.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Licensed Patents' is broad, covering patents issued in any country and based on inventions made on or prior to the Effective Date. The modified version narrows this definition to only U.S. patents based on inventions made *after* the Effective Date. This creates a contradiction, as the same term now refers to different sets of patents, causing confusion about the scope of the license granted.",

The modified text changes this to a limited, exclusive, royalty-bearing license under 'certain patents', not necessarily all 'Licensed Patents', to only 'manufacture and sell' SRAM Products, which is a smaller subset of activities.

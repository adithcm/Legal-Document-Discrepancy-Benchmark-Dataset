                "original_text": "In consideration of the Agents' services to be rendered in connection with the Offering, the Corporation shall pay to the Agents a cash fee (the \"Agents' Fee\") equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. As additional consideration, the Corporation shall issue to the Agents that number of compensation options (the \"Compensation Options\") equal to 3.5% of the number of Offered Shares sold pursuant to the Offering.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the Agents' services to be rendered in connection with the Offering, the Corporation shall provide to the Agents an agent compensation (the \"Agents' Fee\") equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. As additional incentive, the Corporation may grant to the Agents compensation warrants (the \"Compensation Options\") equal to 3.5% of the number of Offered Shares sold pursuant to the Offering.",
                "explanation": "The term 'pay' is replaced with 'provide' making the payment less definitive. 'Additional consideration' is replaced with 'additional incentive' making the warrants discretionary rather than obligatory. 'Shall issue' is replaced with 'may grant,' changing the mandatory nature to permissive, creating a contradiction. The term compensation option is changed to compensation warrants",

                "changed_text": "(b) Delivery of Certificates (i) The Agents shall have received at the Closing Time a written statement dated the Closing Date, addressed to the Agents and signed by officers of the Corporation, with respect to the organizational documents of the Corporation, voluntary dissolution processes, all resolutions of the board members of the Corporation pertaining to this Agreement and the dealings considered by this Agreement and the incumbency and specimen signatures of corporate representatives of the Corporation and other requests by the Agents.",
                "explanation": "The term 'certificate' is changed to 'written statement,' making the assurance less formal and potentially less binding. 'Officers acceptable to the Agents, acting reasonably' is removed. 'Constating documents' is changed to 'organizational documents', the term 'board of directors' is replaced with 'board members,' and 'signing officers' is replaced with 'corporate representatives.' These inconsistencies create ambiguity and reduce the enforceability of the certificate requirement.",

                "explanation": "The term 'expressly provided' is changed to 'specifically noted,' altering the level of clarity required for exceptions. The term 'notice or other communication' is replaced with 'message or correspondence,' which are broader and potentially less formal terms. The term 'shall be' is replaced with 'may be,' changing the mandatory requirement to an option. These create uncertainty about the required method for delivering legal notices.",

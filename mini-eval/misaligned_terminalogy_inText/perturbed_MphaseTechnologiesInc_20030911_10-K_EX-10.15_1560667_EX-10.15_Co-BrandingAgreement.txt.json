                "original_text": "This Agreement is made this 21st day of January 2003 by and between Lucent Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation having a principal place of business at 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974 (\"Lucent\") and mPhase Technologies Inc., a New Jersey corporation located at 587 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 068545 (\"mPhase\") (each individually, \"a Party\" and, collectively, \"the Parties\"}.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement is made this 21st day of January 2003 by and between Lucent Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation having a principal place of business at 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974 (\"Lucent\") and mPhase Technologies Inc., a New Jersey corporation located at 587 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 068545 (\"mPhase\") (each individually, \"a Party\" and, collectively, \"the Organizations\").",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Parties' to 'Organizations' introduces confusion. While seemingly synonymous, 'Parties' has a specific legal meaning within a contract (the signatories to the agreement), while 'Organizations' is broader and undefined in this context. This could lead to disputes regarding who is bound by the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "mPhase agrees to maintain the standard of its Products associated with the Lucent Co-Branding Logo at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'quality of its Goods' to 'standard of its Products' and removing the comparability requirement introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original intention of maintaining a consistent quality level. Furthermore, the 'at its discretion' makes the quality control unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, mPhase shall immediately cease use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, provided, however, that mPhase shall have no obligation to remove such Co-Branding Logo from any Goods sold prior to the date of such termination.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, mPhase should discontinue usage of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, but may continue to sell merchandise produced before the termination date.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall immediately cease use' to 'should discontinue usage' weakens the obligation, making it less enforceable. Replacing 'Goods' with 'merchandise' also introduces a slightly different connotation that could lead to legal challenges, especially regarding types of products covered.",

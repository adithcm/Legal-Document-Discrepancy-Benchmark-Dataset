                "explanation": "The change replaces 'Deliverable' with 'Clients' for the definition. This creates a contradiction, as 'Clients' is redefined without connection to the previous definition of Customer and 'Deliverable' isn't a valid term in this new context, which can lead to ambiguity regarding what constitutes a 'Client' and their roles.",

Owner operates a solar energy facility (the \"SEF\"), and more particularly defined in Exhibit A hereto on the premises (the \"Premises\")  described in Exhibit B hereto for the purposes of providing electric power to the Owner's host customer, Aerojet — Rancho Cordova, CA (the  \"User\");",

It introduces uncertainty about who is actually performing the services and whether 'Maintenance Personnel' are distinct from 'Service Provider'. This affects the responsibilities and liabilities associated with access to the premises and the coordination of services, as it's unclear if they are employees or a third party.",

This charge will be payable on the 1st and 16t h of each month based on the Franchise's gross revenues.",
                "explanation": "The term 'fee' is replaced with 'charge' without any definition, which makes it ambiguous, and there might be confusion with 'Non-Compliance Charge' in section 6.12. Because of the similarity in terms, it can also mean they are different, so it also depends on interpretation.",

                "explanation": "The term 'class-wide basis' is replaced with 'group basis,' which may cause interpretative issues, as both terms are not the same. Class-wide arbitration is more precise, while group basis is a wider umbrella. This may be problematic when enforcing the agreement, since it is vague and not precisely expressed.",

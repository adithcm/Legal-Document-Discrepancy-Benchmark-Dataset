                "original_text": "1.12 \"Specifications\" shall mean the Product specifications provided to ESTABLISHMENT by APOLLO. The Specifications shall include all necessary test protocols, packaging and labeling specifications, bills of materials and other documentation required to describe, control, and assure the quality of the manufacture of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "1.12 \"Specifications\" shall mean the Product requirements outlined by APOLLO. The Requirements may include general product descriptions but do not guarantee specific test protocols, packaging, or labeling.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Specifications' to 'Requirements' and altering the definition introduces ambiguity. Originally, 'Specifications' were detailed and comprehensive. Now, 'Requirements' are vague, potentially leading to disputes over product quality and compliance.",

                "original_text": "3.1Performance Standards. ESTABLISHMENT shall manufacture the Product in accordance with the Specifications of this Agreement, and shall comply with all quality system requirement communicated by Apollo from time to time, ISO 13485:2012 and any applicable cGMPs and all other applicable local, United States or European regulations or laws in connection with the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, shipping, and handling of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "3.1Performance Standards. ESTABLISHMENT shall manufacture the Product according to the Product Outlines, and will endeavor to meet quality expectations communicated by Apollo, but is not strictly bound by ISO 13485:2012 standards. ESTABLISHMENT will attempt to adhere to applicable local, United States, or European guidelines in connection with manufacturing.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Specifications' to 'Product Outlines' and softening the language regarding quality standards creates a contradiction. It's now unclear if ESTABLISHMENT is obligated to meet specific standards like ISO 13485:2012 or simply follow general guidelines. This introduces uncertainty in quality control.",

                "original_text": "5.2Orders. APOLLO shall routinely provide ESTABLISHMENT Purchase Orders for Product demands. All Product ordered by APOLLO shall be in the form of a firm written Purchase Order. Each Purchase Order shall contain at a minimum, the following information: description of the Product and quantity ordered, price, freight carrier information, payment terms, delivery date, and Purchase Order number for billing purposes. The Parties shall cooperate to establish appropriate lead times for orders; requested delivery dates shall provide sufficient lead times for the products ordered.",
                "changed_text": "5.2Orders. APOLLO may provide ESTABLISHMENT Order Requests for Product desires. Product asked by APOLLO may come as an informal Order Request. Each Order Request may contain some information: vague references of the Product and quantity wanted, estimated cost, freight options, payment preferences, possible arrival, and internal identification. The Parties should attempt to discuss suitable scheduling; ideal arrival should accommodate planning.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Purchase Orders' with 'Order Requests' and weakening the mandatory nature of the order details creates confusion. The original text clearly defined the Purchase Order and its required contents, but now it's ambiguous whether these requests are binding and what information must be included. The difference between 'desires' vs 'demands' means that APOLLO is not required to follow through their intial requests.",

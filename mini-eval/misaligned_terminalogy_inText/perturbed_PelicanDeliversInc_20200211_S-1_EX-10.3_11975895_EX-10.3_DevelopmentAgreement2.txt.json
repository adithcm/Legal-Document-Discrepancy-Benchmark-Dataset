                "explanation": "Replacing 'Deliverables' with 'Products', 'Documentation' with 'User Guides', and 'Specifications' with 'Requirements' introduces inconsistent terminology for the same concepts, creating confusion regarding the precise obligations and scope of work. It becomes unclear if 'Products' and 'Deliverables' are the same. This introduces ambiguity, weakening enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Deliverables' to 'Products', 'Acceptance Tests' to 'Quality Checks', and 'Specifications' to 'Requirements' in this section creates further confusion. The document now uses different terms for essentially the same concepts (testing, requirements, and project output). This ambiguity can lead to disputes over whether the correct processes are being followed and if the project outputs meet the required standards. What exactly is the difference between products and deliverables?",

                "explanation": "Switching “Client” to “Customer” and “Designer” to “Developer” creates confusion about whether these terms are truly interchangeable. Throughout the agreement, both parties are referenced with the first set of terms, but in this particular section, the words are changed. This misalignment raises questions about who the non-disparagement clause protects and whether obligations extend to both terms or merely one.",

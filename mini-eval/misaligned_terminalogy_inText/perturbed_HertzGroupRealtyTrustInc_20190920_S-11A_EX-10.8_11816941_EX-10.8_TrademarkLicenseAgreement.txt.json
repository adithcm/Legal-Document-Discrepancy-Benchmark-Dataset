                "original_text": "1.7 \"Licensed Trade Name\" means the corporate name Hertz Group Realty Trust, Inc. and any variation thereof including the term Hertz Group that is used by Licensed Users. 1.8 \"Licensed User\" and \"Licensed Users\" means Licensee and Licensee's subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "1.7 \"Licensed Trade Name\" refers to the business name Hertz Group Realty Trust, Inc. and any similar names incorporating the term Hertz Group as utilized by Franchisees. 1.8 \"Licensed User\" and \"Licensed Users\" includes Licensee, Licensee's subsidiaries, and any associated franchisees.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Licensed Trade Name' is altered to include 'similar names' instead of 'variation,' and 'Licensed Users' is changed to encompass 'franchisees' using 'Franchisees' instead of 'Licensed Users.' This creates confusion as to who is authorized to use the trademark and under what conditions, especially since 'franchisees' are not clearly defined or mentioned elsewhere in the agreement, which could lead to legal disputes.",

                "explanation": "The key terms 'Licensed Users,' 'license,' 'Licensed Trade Name,' and 'Licensed Mark' are replaced with 'Associated Parties,' 'permission,' 'Registered Business Name,' and 'Licensed Brand' respectively, and critical conditions such as 'nontransferable', 'nonsublicensable', 'royalty-free' are altered to their opposites creating an internal contradiction that undermines the fundamental terms of the agreement and their legal implications.",

Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' own expense, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, expense or liability (including attorneys' fees and costs), to the extent that the foregoing (a) is based on a claim resulting solely from any service provided or offered by Licensed Users, (b) results from a material breach, or is based on a claim that, if true, would be a material breach, of this Agreement by Licensed Users, or (c) is based upon Licensed Users' unauthorized or improper use of the Licensed Mark.",

                "explanation": "Numerous critical terms are replaced in this section. 'Indemnification' becomes 'Protection', 'Licensed Users' morphs into a multitude of variants like 'Permitted Individuals', 'Authorized Personnel', 'Associated Persons', and 'Assigned People', and 'Licensed Mark' becomes 'Trade Emblem'.  Furthermore, 'Licensed User's own expense' is switched to 'Licensor's cost' drastically changing the responsibility and adding complexity as to who bears the financial burden, thus weakening the enforceability of the indemnification clause.",

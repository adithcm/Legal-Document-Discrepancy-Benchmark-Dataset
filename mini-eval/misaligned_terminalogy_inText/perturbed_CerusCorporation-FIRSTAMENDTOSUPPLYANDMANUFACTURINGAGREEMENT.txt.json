References in the Agreement to \"Specifications\" shall be interpreted to include the Revised Wafer Specifications, as applicable.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that 'Specifications' includes 'Revised Wafer Specifications,' but the modified text states 'Specifications' only includes 'Existing Wafer Specifications'. This creates a direct contradiction regarding which specifications Porex should use.",

Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.\n\nCerus shall have the right to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, in writing within [*] days from Porex's completion of the Services. Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus.",

Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'Services' where acceptance/rejection is concerned, while the modified text uses 'Deliverables'. 'Services' and 'Deliverables' are not explicitly defined, and therefore it is unclear whether Cerus has the right to reject the 'Services' themselves or just the tangible 'Deliverables' that come from those services. This impacts Cerus' rights of recission.",

Each work order shall set forth the terms and conditions (including specifications (if applicable), delivery and performance schedules, and fees) pursuant to which Porex will perform the Services. Upon acceptance of a work order by Porex (in writing), such work order shall become a \"Statement of Work.\" If Porex begins to perform services under a work order that has not been formally agreed in writing, then Porex shall bear the costs of any expenses incurred prior to formal written agreement of the Statement of Work. Cerus hereby consents to Porex's use of the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, as specified in a Statement of Work, solely as necessary to perform the Services under that Statement of Work. Such consent shall automatically terminate upon the completion of the applicable Statement of Work and is limited by the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Agreement shall control unless the Statement of Work expressly refers to the Parties' intent to alter the terms of the Agreement with respect to that Statement of Work and shall not be construed as an amendment to the terms of the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines all activities in the work order as 'Services' while the modified version changes it to 'Development'. Then, later in the same section 'Services' is mentioned again, regarding the dedicated space/equipment for Porex. Since the 'Statement of Work' refers to services, and the initial part of this clause defines the activities as development, it is unclear what the dedicated space/equipment can be used for, causing confusion.",

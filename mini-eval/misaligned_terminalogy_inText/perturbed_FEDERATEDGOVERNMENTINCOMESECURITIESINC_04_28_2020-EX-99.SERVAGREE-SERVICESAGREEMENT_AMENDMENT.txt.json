Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Amendment have the meanings given to such terms in the Services Agreement (as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, the term \"Adviser\" may also be referred to as the \"Investment Manager\" throughout this Amendment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by suggesting that \"Adviser\" and \"Investment Manager\" are interchangeable without explicitly defining the latter or consistently using it. This could lead to confusion about which entity holds specific responsibilities in subsequent sections.",

                "explanation": "Here, the term \"Adviser\" is replaced with \"Investment Manager\" in the context of providing investment advisory services, creating uncertainty as to whether the obligations are solely of the named Adviser or could apply to another entity referred to as the Investment Manager. This contradicts the initial definition of 'Adviser'.",

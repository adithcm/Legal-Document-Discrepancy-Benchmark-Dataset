                "explanation": "Changing 'Parties' to 'Entities' when referring to MS and MSCI introduces ambiguity. Throughout the contract, 'Party' refers to each individual entity, while 'Parties' refers to both collectively. By changing the collective term to 'Entities', it creates uncertainty about whether provisions referring to 'Parties' apply jointly or severally.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'irrevocable' to 'revocable' in the MSCI grant creates a direct contradiction with the MS grant, where the license is explicitly stated as irrevocable.

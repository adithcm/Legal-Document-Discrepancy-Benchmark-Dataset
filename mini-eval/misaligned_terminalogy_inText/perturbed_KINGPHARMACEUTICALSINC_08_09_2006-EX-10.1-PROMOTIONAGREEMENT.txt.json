                "original_text": "The responsibilities of the JCC shall be exercised consistent with this Agreement and shall include, but shall not be limited to: (a) reviewing and approving modifications to the Launch Plan (provided that no such modification may increase or reduce the Advertising/Marketing/Educational Expenses allocated to the parties under the Launch Plan, or modify any call plan or sampling plan set forth in the Launch Plan, without both parties' written approval).",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the JCC needs *both* parties’ written approval to change the Launch Plan, whereas the modified version allows one party to approve the changes, creating a contradiction.",

Such programs shall include training with respect to reporting Adverse Drug Experiences and technical complaints. After the initial training, King shall periodically provide additional training to each of its Sales Representative, and shall update its training materials as appropriate in connection with such additional training, in accordance with this Section 4.3.",
                "changed_text": "King may, at its discretion and prior to the Promotion Commencement Date, educate its Sales Personnel using internal training documentation, the other Marketing Materials and similar programs that King considers appropriate. These programs may or may not encompass instruction on reporting Drug Side Effects and technical feedback. After the first educational session, King might occasionally offer supplementary education to each Sales Staff, and may adjust its training documentation correspondingly, according to this area. ",
                "explanation": "The original mandates training for Sales Representatives that must adhere to Legal Requirements and be approved by the JCC, whereas the modified version makes the training discretionary and replaces the Sales Representatives with Sales Personnel and Promotional Material with Marketing Material, training on Adverse Drug Experiences and technical complaints with Drug Side Effects and technical feedback, thus decreasing certainty about content requirements.",

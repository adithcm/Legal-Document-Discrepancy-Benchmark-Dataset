                "original_text": "(a) Subject to the satisfactory completion of the Company's customary background check, the Board shall appoint the ValueAct Designee to serve as a director beginning within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of the ValueAct Group's written request to the Company to have the ValueAct Designee appointed to the Board; provided that, at such time, the Board does not conclude in good faith and based on the written opinion of outside legal counsel that such appointment would constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties. If the ValueAct Designee is appointed to the Board pursuant to this Section 1(a), the Company shall include the ValueAct Designee as a Class I Director, which term expires at the Company's 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Subject to the satisfactory completion of the Company's customary background check, the Board may elect the ValueAct Designee to serve as a director beginning within twenty (20) calendar days following receipt of the ValueAct Group's written request to the Company to have the ValueAct Designee nominated to the Board; provided that, at such time, the Executive Committee does not conclude, at its sole discretion, that such nomination would create any potential conflict of interest. If the ValueAct Designee is nominated to the Board pursuant to this Section 1(a), the Company may consider the ValueAct Designee as a possible Class I Director, subject to the discretion of the Nominating Committee, which term expires at the Company's 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Board 'shall appoint' the ValueAct Designee, imposing a clear obligation. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the Board 'may elect' the ValueAct Designee, using 'nominate' instead of 'appoint', giving discretionary power to the Executive Committee to reject based on 'potential conflict of interest,' and replacing 'shall include' with 'may consider', which weakens the commitment. These changes create a contradiction regarding the Company's obligation to appoint the ValueAct Designee.",

                "changed_text": "(b) Each participant of the ValueAct Group should endeavor to ensure that shares of Common Stock beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by it, or by any ValueAct Subsidiary, are represented for quorum purposes and consider voting them, at the Company's annual and special shareholder meetings and at any adjournments or postponements thereof, and further agrees that at the 2015 annual shareholder meeting they will contemplate voting in support of (i) some directors nominated by the Board for election at such meeting and (ii) potentially, in accordance with the Board's suggestion concerning certain proposals for the election of directors that may be the subject of shareholder action at such meeting.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on each member of the ValueAct Group to ensure shares are present and voted in favor of nominated directors. The modified text weakens this by changing 'shall cause' to 'should endeavor to ensure,' 'ValueAct Affiliate' to 'ValueAct Subsidiary,' 'to be voted' to 'consider voting them,' and 'shall vote in favor of' to 'will contemplate voting in support of,' and 'all directors' to 'some directors'. This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of commitment to support the Board's nominees and proposals, creating a contradiction in the enforceability of this section.",

                "original_text": "9. Miscellaneous. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that such damage would not be adequately compensable in monetary damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement, to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware and to   5\n\nrequire the resignation of the ValueAct Designee from the Board commencing on the date that is 10 days following the date that the ValueAct Designee and/or the ValueAct Group materially breaches its obligations under this Agreement, provided, that, such breach has not been cured prior to the expiration of such 10-day period, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity, and each party agrees it will not take any action, directly or indirectly, in opposition to another party seeking relief.",
                "changed_text": "9. Supplementary. The parties acknowledge that potential detriments may occur if certain provisions of this Agreement are not followed strictly, and that financial compensation might not fully address these detriments. Therefore, the parties involved may request an injunction or injunctions to address possible non-compliance with this Agreement, to promote adherence to the stipulations of this Agreement primarily through the Court of Chancery or other federal or state courts of the State of Delaware and to consider the resignation of the ValueAct Representative from the Board starting 30 days after the ValueAct Representative and/or the ValueAct Collective significantly deviates from the requirements of this Agreement, if such deviation remains unaddressed after those 30 days, along with other available legal or equitable remedies, and each party agrees to abstain from actions that counteract another party's pursuit of redress.",
                "explanation": "The original text asserts that 'irreparable damage would occur' if provisions are not performed according to the terms and the parties 'shall be entitled to an injunction'. The modified text weakens this by using softer language: 'potential detriments may occur', 'financial compensation might not fully address,' and 'may request an injunction'. This makes the availability of an injunction less certain. Similarly, the 'ValueAct Designee' changes to the 'ValueAct Representative' and 'ValueAct Group' to 'ValueAct Collective', which are terms that were not clearly defined beforehand. Moreover, the time to resign changed from 10 to 30 days. The combination of all those elements undermine the certainty of enforcement, creating a contradiction.",

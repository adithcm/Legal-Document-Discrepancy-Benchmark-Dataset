                "original_text": "1.1. AFFILIATE shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting securities of a party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such party.",
                "changed_text": "1.1. AFFILIATE shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" constitutes the direct or indirect influence over the operational decisions of a party.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines \"control\" as ownership of at least 50% of voting securities or the right to control policy decisions. The modified text changes the definition of \"control\" to \"influence over operational decisions.\" This introduces an internal contradiction because \"control\" now has two different definitions within the same contract, leading to uncertainty. One could argue ownership is required, while another interpretation would allow for operational influence as fulfilling the definition of control.",

                "explanation": "The original 'USER' definition refers to a single person, whereas the modified version includes 'automated system.' The original text excludes information about a particular project of the User, while the modified version explicitly includes it.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS shall mean all rights in and to Intellectual Property, limited to patents and registered copyrights.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY' is broad, encompassing various types of intellectual creations. In contrast, the modified definition limits it to tangible inventions and designs. Similarly, 'INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS' originally covered a wide range of rights, while the revision focuses solely on rights related to patents and registered copyrights. These changes generate contradiction and raise ambiguities in the agreement, leading to confusion regarding the extent of protection covered. For example, trade secrets might no longer be considered 'INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY', leading to complications in enforcement.",

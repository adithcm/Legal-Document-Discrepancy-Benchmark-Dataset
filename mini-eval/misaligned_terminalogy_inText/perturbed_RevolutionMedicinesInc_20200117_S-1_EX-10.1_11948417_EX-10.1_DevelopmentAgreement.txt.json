                "explanation": "The original textâ€™s definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' for RevMed is replaced with a generalized description. This creates a conflict because the original definition implies specific considerations for RevMed, whereas the new definition is more ambiguous and standard, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "In the original agreement the document enforces **exclusive right** to Sanofi with a royalty fee; however, the changed version has made it into a *non-exclusive permit* with no associated royalties. This is creating a direct contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The text has switched from using 'Co-Promotion' to 'Co-Marketing.'

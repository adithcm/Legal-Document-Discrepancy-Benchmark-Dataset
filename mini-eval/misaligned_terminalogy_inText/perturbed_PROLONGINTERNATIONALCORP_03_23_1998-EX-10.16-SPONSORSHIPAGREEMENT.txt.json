The drivers for the 33 Winston Cup events to be held -------- during the 1998 season in which Prolong is an associate sponsor shall be Sterling Marlin (40), Joe Nemechek (42) and Wally Dallenbach Jr. (46), unless due to injury or for some unforeseeable reason, either is unable to drive, in which event Sabco shall choose a substitute driver to drive their respective Sabco/Prolong-sponsored entry.

The drivers for the 33 Winston Cup events to be held -------- during the 1998 season in which Prolong is an associate sponsor shall be Sterling Marlin (40), Joe Nemechek (42) and Wally Dallenbach Jr. (46), unless due to injury or for some unforeseeable reason, either is unable to drive, in which event Sabco shall choose a substitute driver to drive their respective Sabco/Prolong-sponsored entry. For the duration of this agreement, Sabco may substitute any driver at its discretion. Sabco is not obligated to inform Prolong of any driver changes but will attempt to provide a commercially reasonable update when practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Sabco 'reserves the right to substitute or replace' drivers. The modified text states Sabco 'may substitute any driver at its discretion' and lessens the obligation to inform Prolong. It's contradictory because the level of obligation is decreased, possibly leading to disputes over driver selection and Prolong's advertising strategy.",

Sabco shall further provide the services of each driver for one free day for commercial use (up to six hours each) for marketing endeavors. Prolong shall be responsible for standard travel expenses relating to each driver interaction.

                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'first class travel expenses' and a 'discounted rate' for additional appearances. The modified text changes 'first class' to 'reasonable travel expenses', 'marketing endeavors' instead of 'commercial use', and changes 'discounted rate' to the 'market rate', and 'no additional costs' to 'standard rates'. Also changed the obligation of 'shall allow' to 'shall use best efforts', which is a weaker obligation. This is contradictory and introduces uncertainty about the financial commitments required of Prolong and the obligations of Sabco.",

Sabco will attempt to email Prolong representatives with race results and key highlights following each race weekend.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall provide at its expense a staff member' which is a clear obligation, and 'shall cause Prolong to receive prominent mention' which is a strong commitment. The modified text uses 'will provide a media contact', changes the staff member to media contact, and uses 'endeavor to include Prolong', which is less direct and weaker than 'shall cause to receive prominent mention'. The mode of communication changed from 'fax' to 'email'. The level of obligation is weakened and terminology changed, creating uncertainty about the extent of Sabco's commitment to promoting Prolong, the type of staff dedicated and how they are committed to providing services.",

                "explanation": "The relocation of the 'Waiver of Jury Trial' clause from the 'Dispute Resolution' section to a newly created 'Employee Benefits' section makes it less likely that parties will be aware of this waiver when disputes arise, diminishing its enforceability. Courts usually expect waivers of jury trials to be conspicuously placed and clearly understood.",

By placing this clause in an unexpected section, it can be argued that the waiver was not made knowingly.",

                "explanation": "The governing law clause has been moved from its logical position to be placed immediately after the language clause at the end of the 'Miscellaneous' section. This placement is misleading because it is not clearly identified as a governing law provision, which is typically placed at or near the beginning or end of the agreement, not buried in the middle of 'Miscellaneous' clauses. The relocation reduces its prominence and discoverability, making it more difficult for a party to readily ascertain the applicable law.",

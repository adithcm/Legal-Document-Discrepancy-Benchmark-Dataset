                "original_text": "24.\tGoverning law and jurisdiction\n24.1\tThis agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation\n(including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Ohio\nlaw.\n24.2\tThe parties irrevocably agree that the courts of Ohio shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute\nor claim that arises out of or in connection with this agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-\ncontractual disputes or claims).",
                "changed_text": "17. Freedom to contract\nThe parties declare that they each have the right, power and authority and have taken all action necessary to execute and deliver and to exercise their rights and perform their obligations under this agreement. Any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Ohio law, but jurisdiction will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The governing law and jurisdiction clause has been moved to the 'Freedom to Contract' section, making it less prominent and harder to find. Moreover, the clause now states that jurisdiction will be determined on a case-by-case basis which contradicts the previous explicit agreement to Ohio jurisdiction. This introduces a contradiction that can be exploited in court.",

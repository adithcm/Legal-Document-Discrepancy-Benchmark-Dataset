                "original_text": "12. Liability Limitation. EXCEPT FOR IN THE EVENT OF WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, THE RESELLER\nAND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE COMPANY, AND SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY OR\nHOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY, WITH RESPECT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LOSS RESULTING FROM OR\nCAUSED BY THE COMPANY PRODUCTS.",
                "changed_text": "14. Miscellaneous. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or\neliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided herein, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived only with the written\nconsent of both parties. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which so executed and delivered\n(including by emailed PDF) shall constitute an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same\ninstrument. THE RESELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE COMPANY, AND SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY OR\nHOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY, WITH RESPECT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LOSS RESULTING FROM OR\nCAUSED BY THE COMPANY PRODUCTS. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard\nto the conflicts of law provisions thereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements or discussions between the parties\nwith respect to the subject matter hereof.",
                "explanation": "Moving the liability limitation clause to the 'Miscellaneous' section obscures its importance and could make it harder for the Company to recognize and understand the limitations on the Reseller's liability. By embedding it within boilerplate language, its enforceability is potentially weakened due to reduced prominence.",
                "contradicted_law": "While not directly violating a specific law, this change undermines the principle of clear and conspicuous contract terms, which is important for contract enforcement and fair dealings, potentially conflicting with general principles of contract law.",

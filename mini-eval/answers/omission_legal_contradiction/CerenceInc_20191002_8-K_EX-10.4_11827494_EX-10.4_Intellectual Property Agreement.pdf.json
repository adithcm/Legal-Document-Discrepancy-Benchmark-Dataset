EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION\nRELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING\nTHEIR EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS\nINTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE\nSUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF DUTY\nCLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.

THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER MAY APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DISPUTES. THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS SECTION WILL BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS.",
                "explanation": "The original clause contained an explicit and comprehensive waiver of jury trial rights. The modified clause weakens this waiver by using \"may waive\" instead of \"hereby waives,\" suggesting the possibility of retaining jury trial rights. By saying, \"The applicability of this section will be subject to certain exceptions,\" gives the impression the waiver is no longer all-encompassing. This introduces a legal risk because the waiver may not be enforceable, particularly if a party later claims they did not fully understand the implications of waiving their right to a jury trial. Many states require waivers to be 'knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.'",

                "explanation": "The removal of the jury trial waiver clause eliminates an important protection of the right to a jury trial, which is often seen as a fundamental right. This omission weakens consumer protections and introduces significant legal risk because such waivers must be knowing and voluntary, and the original clause was drafted to ensure just that. Removing it now violates Delaware's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it is later argued the waiver was not knowing and voluntary.",

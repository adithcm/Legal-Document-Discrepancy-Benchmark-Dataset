                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase 'In no event shall eDiets disclose or otherwise transfer to any person or entity any Women.com Data that individually or in the aggregate identifies the identity, habits or transactions of the Women.com users' allows eDiets to share or sell user data without restriction. This contradicts the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and similar privacy laws, which require explicit consent and control over personal data. By omitting the prohibition against disclosing user data, the contract creates a legal loophole that could violate privacy regulations, potentially exposing Women.com to liability.",

Network Affiliate shall maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance on the Theatres and the Equipment in such amounts and against such perils as Network Affiliate deems adequate for its business. NCM shall maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance for its business and Equipment in such amounts and against such perils as NCM deems adequate for its business, including the installation services set forth in Section 2.2 herein. Each Party will name the other Party (including its agents, officers, directors, employees and affiliates) as an additional insured on such policies of insurance.",

                "explanation": "The original text required both parties to maintain adequate insurance and to name each other as additional insureds. By removing the requirement for 'financially sound and reputable insurance companies', removing the need to specify coverage 'against such perils', and removing the additional insured clause, the modified text weakens the insurance requirement, creating a potential legal contradiction with standard business practice and potentially applicable state laws regarding minimum insurance coverage for businesses and commercial properties in Delaware, where both companies are incorporated. Some states require businesses to carry specific types of insurance (like general liability or workers' compensation) and minimum coverage amounts.",

                "original_text": "All such materials shall be submitted to Chase at least seven (7) days prior to the date of first intended use. Chase will notify Affiliate of its approval or disapproval of such materials within five (5) business days of its receipt of all information required to be submitted.",
                "changed_text": "All such materials shall be submitted to Chase at least two (2) days prior to the date of first intended use. Chase will notify Affiliate of its approval or disapproval of such materials within ten (10) business days of its receipt of all information required to be submitted.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires materials to be submitted 7 days in advance, and Chase to respond within 5 business days. Shortening the submission window to 2 days introduces potential conflicts with standard review periods and industry best practices for marketing material compliance, which generally necessitate a reasonable timeframe for thorough review. Conversely, extending the approval period to 10 business days could unduly delay affiliate marketing efforts, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing that require parties to not unreasonably hinder the other party's performance under the contract. These changes, while seemingly minor, could lead to disputes over timely review and approval of materials, making the agreement's implementation challenging and contradicting standard business practices. While this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, imposing impractical and unfavorable conditions on an affiliate could also expose Chase to claims of breach of contract or bad faith, as these modifications are not necessarily commercially reasonable or standard in affiliate agreements.",

Unless earlier terminated as provided below, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”) after which this Agreement may be extended on mutual agreement of the parties (a “Renewal Term,” and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”). If either party wishes to extend the Initial Term it shall provide notice to the other not later than 180 days, nor sooner than 270 days, before the end of the Initial Term. The parties shall then engage in discussions regarding renewal for a period of 30 days. If no agreement is reached during that 30-day period, then neither party shall have any obligation to extend this Agreement beyond the Initial Term.",

Unless earlier terminated as provided below, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”) after which this Agreement may be extended on mutual agreement of the parties (a “Renewal Term,” and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”). If either party wishes to extend the Initial Term it shall provide notice to the other not later than 30 days, nor sooner than 45 days, before the end of the Initial Term.

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a notification period of 180-270 days before the end of the term for renewal. The modification reduces this to 30-45 days with only a 5-day period for discussions. This change is a contradiction because, depending on the state, the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing may require a more reasonable timeframe for negotiating a contract renewal. Some states might view 30-45 days as insufficient time, especially for complex agreements like this. This change introduces uncertainty and possible legal challenges regarding the enforceability of the renewal terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract law, potentially violating state-specific interpretations of reasonable notice periods for contract renewals.",

                "original_text": "For each Approved Account (as defined in section 4 below) received through Affiliate’s site, Affiliate will earn a referral fee calculated in accordance with the schedule set forth below (“Commission”) paid monthly.",
                "changed_text": "For each Approved Account (as defined in section 4 below) received through Affiliate’s site, Affiliate will earn a referral fee calculated in accordance with the schedule set forth below (“Commission”) paid monthly, *provided that the approved accounts reach a minimum threshold of 100 applications per month. Otherwise, payment will be made quarterly.*",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding the frequency of commission payments. Initially, commissions are stated to be paid monthly. The added text introduces a threshold requirement that, if not met, changes the payment frequency to quarterly. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about when the affiliate will actually receive payment, and depends on the number of approved accounts in a given month.",

                "explanation": "This edit introduces ambiguity to the payment terms in section 5. Previously, the affiliate was guaranteed commission payments for approved accounts made during the agreement's term. The addition of 'only if' and the conditions of 'good standing' and adherence to 'evolving marketing strategies' provides Chase with wiggle room to withhold payments. These new conditions lack specific definition, making them easily subject to interpretation and potentially causing payment disputes.",

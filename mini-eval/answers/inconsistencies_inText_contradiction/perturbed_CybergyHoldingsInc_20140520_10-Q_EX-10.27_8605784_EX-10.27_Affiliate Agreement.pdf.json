                "original_text": "Unless otherwise approved by Company, Level I, II and III terms for payment to Company are Net 30 days on Technology licensed from Company.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise approved by Company, Level I terms for payment to Company are Net 30 days. Level II terms are Net 45 days, and Level III terms are due 15 days from the invoice date. Company reserves the right to change payment terms with 10 days notice.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces conflicting payment terms based on the purchase level of the Marketing Affiliate (MA). This contradicts the uniform 'Net 30 days' originally stipulated, creating ambiguity. Additionally, the clause granting Company the right to alter payment terms with only 10 days' notice introduces uncertainty regarding the enforcement of any specific payment deadline.",

However, Level III accounts will not be charged any late fees.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding late payment fees. While the original text states a late payment charge applies to *all* overdue accounts, the altered text carves out an exception for Level III accounts, creating a conflict in terms and uncertainty about which rule applies to those accounts.",

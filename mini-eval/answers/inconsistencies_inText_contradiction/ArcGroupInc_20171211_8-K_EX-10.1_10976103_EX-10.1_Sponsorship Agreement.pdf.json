                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each\ndue on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sponsor shall have until December 15th of each applicable contract year to make the final payment without penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. Section 3(a) states that all installments are due by November 1st, but the added sentence allows the final payment to be made as late as December 15th without penalty. This creates ambiguity as to the actual deadline for the final installment and whether late fees would apply between November 2nd and December 15th.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction about whether the sponsor is relieved from payment if the invoice is not delivered. Originally, the contract stated that the sponsor is still obligated to pay even without an invoice. Now, the edited text states that the sponsor is relieved of payment if the invoice is not provided. This makes it unclear whether the sponsor is liable to pay if the invoice is not received, introducing contractual ambiguity.",

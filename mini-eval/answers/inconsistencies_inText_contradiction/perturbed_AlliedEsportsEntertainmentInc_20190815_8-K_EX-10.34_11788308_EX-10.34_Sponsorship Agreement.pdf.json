                "original_text": "4.2 Newegg shall provide to Allied the Sponsorship Benefits set out in Schedule 3, including paying the Sponsorship Fee as provided in that Schedule. Any value-added, goods and services, or similar tax or duty imposed by any government or tax authority on any Sponsorship Benefit shall be borne solely by Allied.",

Any value-added, goods and services, or similar tax or duty imposed by any government or tax authority on any Sponsorship Benefit shall be borne solely by Allied. Newegg has 60 days from the invoice date to remit payment.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a specific payment deadline of 60 days in Section 4.2. This contradicts Section 14.4 which discusses potential defaults by Newegg and a 15-day cure period. It is now unclear if Newegg has 15 days to cure a payment default (as implied by 14.4) or 60 days to make the initial payment (as stated in 4.2). This ambiguity could lead to disputes about when a payment is officially late and when a default occurs.",

                "explanation": "By adding \"except for instances of late payment,\" this section now creates an exception to the 15-day cure period specifically for late payments. However, it does not explicitly state what the cure period *is* for late payments, leading to potential confusion. Given the change in Section 4.2 which grants 60 days, the question of the actual deadline to cure a payment is questionable and could lead to disputes.",

                "original_text": "Section 7.3 Payment. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all amounts due by one Party to the other under this Agreement, less any permitted deductions, shall be paid in full within sixty (60) days after the fiscal month in which such amounts were received by the paying Party, or the receipt by the paying Party of an invoice therefore, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "Section 7.3 Payment. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all amounts due by one Party to the other under this Agreement, less any permitted deductions, shall be paid in full within thirty (30) days after the fiscal month in which such amounts were received by the paying Party, or the receipt by the paying Party of an invoice therefore, as applicable. However, if the paying party deems the invoice to be inaccurate, payment can be withheld for up to ninety (90) days pending resolution of the dispute.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding payment deadlines. Section 7.3 originally states payment should be made within 60 days. The modified version reduces this to 30 days but adds a clause allowing payment to be withheld for up to 90 days in case of a dispute. This creates uncertainty about when payment is actually due, especially if there is a disagreement on the invoice. This creates potential for disputes and ambiguity in enforcement.",

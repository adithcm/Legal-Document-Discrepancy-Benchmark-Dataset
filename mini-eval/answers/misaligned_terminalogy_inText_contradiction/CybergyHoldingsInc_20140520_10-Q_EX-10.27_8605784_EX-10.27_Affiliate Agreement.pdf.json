This leads to ambiguity, as they could refer to a different group entirely, potentially impacting the scope of services. While the change does not modify the text, the addition in the next section will add the contradiction. Therefore, this section is left as is.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'clients' to 'end users' in Section 4.5, we create a contradiction. 'Clients' are defined in Section 2.1 as corporate users, government agencies, and educational facilities. 'End users', however, is an undefined term. This means that Company is imposing a satisfaction requirement that is not clearly defined, enforceable, or applicable to the same entity outlined in the rest of the contract, leading to potential disputes over obligations and enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Northern California Chapter' is replaced with 'Northern California Affiliate'. This creates confusion as 'Northern California Affiliate' is not defined anywhere else in the agreement. It is now unclear whether the 'Northern California Chapter' and the 'Northern California Affiliate' refer to the same entity, potentially creating confusion about which entity is entitled to the donation.",

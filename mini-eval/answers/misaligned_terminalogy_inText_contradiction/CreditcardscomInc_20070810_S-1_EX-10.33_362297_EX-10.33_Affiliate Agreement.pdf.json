Affiliate is responsible for obtaining prior written approval from the Chase Affiliate manager or Linkshare Network to link any or all other sites owned or managed by the Affiliate, other than the site that was approved at the time of original registration. Affiliate may select or remove Links, at any time without prior approval from Chase. Affiliate is also responsible for removing and/or informing Chase of potential inactive or misdirected Links. Affiliate agrees to cooperate with Chase in establishing and maintaining Links.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Affiliate' is changed to 'Partner' in the second sentence. While 'Affiliate' is defined in the first paragraph, 'Partner' is not. This introduces ambiguity: is the 'Partner' the same as the 'Affiliate,' a subset of 'Affiliates,' or a completely different entity? This creates internal confusion regarding who is responsible for obtaining prior written approval, especially concerning sites managed by the 'Affiliate'. It is not clear if 'Affiliate' and 'Partner' are referring to the same legal entity.",

                "explanation": "The term 'customer' is changed to 'client' in the confidentiality clause. The term 'Customer' is used throughout the agreement and has an implicit definition (someone who applies for a Chase card through the Affiliate's link). Introducing 'client' without defining it creates uncertainty: are 'clients' and 'customers' the same? This potentially affects the scope of confidential information, especially concerning lists of 'clients' versus 'customers'. The ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether information about a specific individual is protected under this clause.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Bizzingo has developed a B2B interactive platform which engages in business social media including mobile and Internet applications \n(“Network”); and \n\nWHEREAS, Bizzingo is desirous of acquiring the rights to utilize Theismann’s name in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale of the \nNetwork as provided herein and Theismann is willing to grant such right",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Bizzingo has developed a B2B interactive platform which engages in business social media including mobile and Internet applications \n(“Platform”); and \n\nWHEREAS, Bizzingo is desirous of acquiring the rights to utilize Theismann’s name in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale of the \nNetwork as provided herein and Theismann is willing to grant such right",
                "explanation": "The original agreement defines 'Network' as Bizzingo's platform. The change introduces 'Platform' in the definition section while only 'Network' is used in the Grant of Rights section. This creates confusion about whether Theismann's endorsement applies to the 'Platform' or just the 'Network' as defined, and if they are indeed the same thing.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Royalty' is specifically defined and used throughout the agreement. Changing 'Royalty' to 'Compensation' in the first sentence creates a contradiction because it is already defined. This raises the question if 'Compensation' is different from 'Royalty' and if additional compensations are required, other than the clearly defined 'Royalty'.",

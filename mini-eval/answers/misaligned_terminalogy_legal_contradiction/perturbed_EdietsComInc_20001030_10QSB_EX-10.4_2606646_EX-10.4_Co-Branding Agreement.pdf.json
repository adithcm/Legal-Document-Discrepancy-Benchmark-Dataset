                "original_text": "15.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in\naccordance with the laws of the State of California as applied to agreements\nmade, entered into and performed entirely in California by California residents,\nnotwithstanding the actual residence of the parties, without giving effect to\nany choice of laws of California that would require the application of the laws\nof a state other than California.",
                "changed_text": "15.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in\naccordance with the laws of the State of California, specifically excluding\nCalifornia's Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), even if the agreement involves\ntransactions that would normally fall under the UCC's scope. The parties agree\nthat principles of equity and general contract law, as interpreted outside the\nUCC, will govern all aspects of this agreement, notwithstanding the actual\nresidence of the parties.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts established legal principles. The UCC is the primary body of law governing commercial transactions in California. Excluding it from the governing law, even when applicable, creates a legal contradiction because the UCC would normally apply to contracts involving the sale of goods or other commercial activities. It creates legal uncertainty and potential unenforceability, especially in disputes regarding sales, warranties, or other commercial aspects of the agreement. California Civil Code Section 1646 mandates the agreement to be interpreted per the laws of the state (including the UCC).",

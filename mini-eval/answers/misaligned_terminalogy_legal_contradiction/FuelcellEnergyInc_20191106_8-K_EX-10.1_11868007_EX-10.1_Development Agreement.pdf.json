                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it replaces a mandatory obligation ('will comply') with a discretionary one ('will attempt to comply'). This directly conflicts with the general principle that contracts must adhere to all relevant laws, making the clause unenforceable and potentially voiding aspects of the agreement due to non-compliance. The original clause ensured that neither party could take actions that violate legal standards, but the modified clause implies that a party might choose not to comply fully, which is a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"arms-length basis\" to \"non-arms-length basis\" and replacing the requirement to use \"standard accounting practices in accordance with GAAP\" with \"using any accounting practices ETON deems appropriate\", this modification fundamentally alters the definition of \"Net Sales\" to deviate from common practice and legal understanding. Sales to affiliates not at market prices would typically not be included in the calculation of net sales or royalties. Additionally, using accounting practices that aren't consistent with GAAP makes it difficult to have an accurate and agreed-upon amount for Net Sales.",

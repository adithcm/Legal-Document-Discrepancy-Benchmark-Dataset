                "explanation": "The original contract states the fund intends to operate as an interval fund pursuant to Rule 23c-3 of the Investment Company Act. The modified contract contradicts this by stating the fund intends to operate *without regard* to the requirements of Rule 23c-3. This creates a legal contradiction because interval funds are subject to specific regulations under the Investment Company Act, which this change implies the fund will disregard, leading to non-compliance.",

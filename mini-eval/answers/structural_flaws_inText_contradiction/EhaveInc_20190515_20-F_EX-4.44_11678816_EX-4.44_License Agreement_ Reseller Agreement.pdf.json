                "explanation": "Section 9 originally stated that the contract term was in perpetuity. By changing this to a one-year term, it directly contradicts the 'unless terminated earlier' clause, creating ambiguity. One section implies that the contract can last indefinitely, while the other limits it to one year, regardless of termination clauses.",

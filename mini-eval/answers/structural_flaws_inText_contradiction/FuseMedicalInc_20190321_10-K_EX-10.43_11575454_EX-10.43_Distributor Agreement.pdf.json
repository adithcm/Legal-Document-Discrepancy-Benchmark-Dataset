                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "5.3 The Distributor must pay the full amount invoiced to it by the Supplier in USD$’s within thirty (45) days of the date of invoice.",
                "changed_text": "20.3 A notice given under this agreement shall not be validly given if sent by e-mail.\n\n5.3 The Distributor must pay the full amount invoiced to it by the Supplier in USD$’s within ninety (30) days of the date of invoice.",
                "explanation": "By relocating the payment term of 'thirty (45) days' to now read 'ninety (30) days', a direct contradiction is created. Section 5.3 now ambiguously states both 90 and 30 days as the payment term creating uncertainty as to which to follow. The original intent was 45 days but with both a longer and shorter term now present, it is unclear which one the parties intended to follow.",

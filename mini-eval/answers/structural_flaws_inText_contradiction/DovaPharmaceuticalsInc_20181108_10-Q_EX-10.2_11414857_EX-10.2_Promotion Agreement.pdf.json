For initial orders of Product from Dova (or its Affiliates or its Intermediaries) to the Non-Retail Institutions, Dova shall not engage in any “channel stuffing” or any similar program, activity or other action (including any rebate, discount, chargeback or refund policy or practice) that in each case is intended by Dova to result in purchases by the Non-Retail Institutions that are materially in excess of purchases in the ordinary course of business or that is intended to materially adversely impact Valeant’s promotion fee pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, this Section10.4.1 shall not be applicable to any activity or action taken by Dova which applies to all or substantially all customers for the Product, or any activity or action taken by Dova in good faith and consistent with customary sales and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry.",
                "changed_text": "5.10 Manufacturing; Distribution; Marketing. Dova shall have the sole authority, at its cost, to manufacture, package, label, warehouse, sell and distribute the Product in the Territory. Dova shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause sufficient quantities of the Product to be available in inventory to promptly fill orders throughout the Territory and otherwise meet the forecasted demand for the Product in the Territory. If, despite such efforts, there is insufficient supply of Product to meet demand, then Dova shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly address such insufficiency. Dova shall contractually require (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such contractual provisions) that all Product is manufactured, shipped, sold and distributed in accordance with all Product specifications and all Applicable Law and that its contract manufacturers and/or suppliers of Product operate their facilities in accordance with Applicable Law. Dova shall ensure that all Product Labeling complies with the applicable Regulatory Approval for the Product and Applicable Law. Other than as set forth in this Agreement, Dova shall be responsible for all marketing of the Product in the Territory, provided that Dova shall continue to invest in marketing that is targeted towards the Specialty.\n\n10.4.1 Initial Orders to Non-Retail Institutions. For initial orders of Product from Dova (or its Affiliates or its Intermediaries) to the Non-Retail Institutions, Dova is permitted to engage in “channel stuffing” or any similar program, activity or other action (including any rebate, discount, chargeback or refund policy or practice) that in each case is intended by Dova to result in purchases by the Non-Retail Institutions that are materially in excess of purchases in the ordinary course of business or that is intended to materially adversely impact Valeant’s promotion fee pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, this Section10.4.1 shall be applicable to any activity or action taken by Dova which does not applies to all or substantially all customers for the Product, or any activity or action taken by Dova that is not in good faith and not consistent with customary sales and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry.",
                "explanation": "The original Section 10.4.1 prohibited Dova from engaging in \"channel stuffing.\" The modified version, now placed within Section 5.10, explicitly permits Dova to engage in such practices. This creates a direct contradiction. The modified text states Dova *is permitted* to engage in channel stuffing, negating the original prohibition. The enforceability of the agreement is now uncertain.",

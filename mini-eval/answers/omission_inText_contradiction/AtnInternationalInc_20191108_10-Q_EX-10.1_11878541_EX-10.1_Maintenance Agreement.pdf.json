                "original_text": "(a) Vendor shall submit annual participation plans in the form set forth at http://www.attsuppliers.com no later than the Effective Date and by December 31 of each calendar year thereafter, establishing Vendor’s goals for the upcoming reporting period for participation by minority owned business enterprises (“MBE”), women owned business enterprises (“WBE”) and disabled veteran owned business enterprises (“DVBE”), with “participation” expressed as a percentage of aggregate estimated annual purchases by AT&T for the reporting period.\n(b) By the tenth day following the close of each calendar month, Vendor shall, in a format and manner acceptable to AT&T, report actual results of its efforts to meet the goals set forth in the applicable participation plan during the preceding calendar month. When reporting results, Vendor shall count only expenditures with entities that are certified as MBE, WBE, or DVBE firms by third party certifying agencies recognized by AT&T, as listed on http://www.attsuppliers.com.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Vendor shall submit plans establishing goals for participation by diverse business enterprises. Vendor will report results of its efforts to meet the goals.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention and definition of MBE, WBE and DVBE categories, and the link to AT&T's list of certified agencies, the modified text creates ambiguity. The reference to 'diverse business enterprises' remains, but without the specific definition, it creates a contradiction because the contract refers to a specific type of diverse business but no longer has the criteria for validation.",

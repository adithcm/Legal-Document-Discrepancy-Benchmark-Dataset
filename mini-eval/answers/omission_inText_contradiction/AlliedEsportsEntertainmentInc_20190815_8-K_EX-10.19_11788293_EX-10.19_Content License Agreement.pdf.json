                "explanation": "By removing clause 5(c), the contract now lacks specific guidelines for seeking or receiving indemnification in cases involving third-party claims. While Sections 5(a) and 5(b) still establish the indemnification obligations of each party, the omission of 5(c) creates an ambiguity regarding the process for claiming indemnification. Specifically, the requirement for prompt notification, reasonable cooperation, and the opportunity to participate in settlements are all absent. This omission creates uncertainty and could lead to disputes over how indemnification claims should be handled.",

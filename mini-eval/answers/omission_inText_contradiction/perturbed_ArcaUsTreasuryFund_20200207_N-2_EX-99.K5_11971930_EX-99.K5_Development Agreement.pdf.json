                "original_text": "(a) In full consideration of the provision of the services of the Blockchain Administrator set forth herein, the Fund shall pay the\nBlockchain Administrator a fees calculated at the annual rate of 0.20% of the value of the Fundâ€™s average annual net assets. Such fee shall be\naccrued daily and paid monthly in arrears.",
                "changed_text": "(a) In full consideration of the provision of the services of the Blockchain Administrator set forth herein, the Fund shall pay the\nBlockchain Administrator a fee as determined by the Board. Such fee shall be paid monthly.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific calculation of the blockchain administrator's fees (0.20% of average annual net assets), the agreement becomes ambiguous. Later references to 'amounts owed under Section 4' in Section 7 now lack a concrete calculation method, creating an internal contradiction. While Section 7(a) still refers to amounts owed per Section 4, the method for calculating those amounts has been removed.",

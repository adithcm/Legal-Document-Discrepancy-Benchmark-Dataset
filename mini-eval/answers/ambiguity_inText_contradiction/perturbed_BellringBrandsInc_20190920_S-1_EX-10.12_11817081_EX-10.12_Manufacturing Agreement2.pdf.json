                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall be required', establishing a firm obligation for Premier to purchase the MAOV. The modified text uses 'shall aim to purchase' and 'may be', making the purchase volume less certain and creating ambiguity around Premier's obligation. Replacing 'will be required to purchase' with 'will likely purchase' further dilutes the commitment.",

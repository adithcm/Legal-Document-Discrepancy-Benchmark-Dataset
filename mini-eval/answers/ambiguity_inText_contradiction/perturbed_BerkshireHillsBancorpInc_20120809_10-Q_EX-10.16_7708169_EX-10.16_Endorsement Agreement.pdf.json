Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of clause 6(a) regarding Auriemma's availability for appearances, the Services Period shall extend to May 31, 2015.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the definition of 'SERVICES PERIOD'. The initial definition states it ends May 31, 2014. However, the added clause extends it to May 31, 2015, specifically for Auriemma's appearance obligations under clause 6(a). This could create confusion regarding which version of the SERVICES PERIOD definition governs different aspects of the contract, leading to disputes about Auriemma's obligations.",

                "original_text": "1.1 Certain Definitions. As used herein, capitalized terms have the meaning ascribed to them herein, including the following terms have the meanings set forth below. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 Certain Definitions. As used herein, capitalized terms have the meaning ascribed to them herein, including the following terms may have the meanings set forth below. Capitalized terms that are not explicitly defined in this Agreement may be interpreted based on common industry usage, irrespective of definitions found in the Stock Purchase Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states capitalized terms not defined in the IP Agreement follow the Stock Purchase Agreement. The modified text introduces ambiguity by saying the terms 'may' have the meanings set forth below and that industry usage can override the Stock Purchase Agreement, creating a direct contradiction and uncertainty in interpretation.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Company Field' is a concrete listing of activities related to flooring products. The modified version makes it vague and subject to the Trademark License Agreement, potentially narrowing the scope, thereby contradicting the original broad definition if the Trademark License Agreement contains conflicting limitations.",

Arizona may sublicense the licenses granted herein to its Affiliates and Third Parties in the ordinary course of business in support of its and its Affiliates’ business, but not for the independent use of Third Parties, and the Company may sublicense the licenses granted herein to Third Parties, its Subsidiaries, AWP, controlled Affiliates, or any holding company that is a direct or indirect parent of the Company in the ordinary course of business in support of its and its Subsidiaries’ or controlled Affiliates’ business, but not for the independent use of Third Parties (each such Affiliate, Third Party, AWP or Subsidiary, a “Sublicensee”). Each Party shall ensure that any sublicense that it grants to a Sublicensee does not conflict with this Agreement. For clarity, granting a sublicense shall not relieve the Parties of any obligations hereunder and each Party shall cause each of its Sublicensees to comply, and shall remain responsible for such Sublicensees’ compliance, with all terms and conditions hereof applicable to the Parties. At the request of a licensing Party, the other Party shall provide to the licensing Party a list of all Sublicensees and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the licensing Party in connection with Sublicensees’ compliance with this Agreement.",

Arizona may sublicense the licenses granted herein to its Affiliates and Third Parties in the ordinary course of business in support of its and its Affiliates’ business, but not for the independent use of Third Parties, and the Company may sublicense the licenses granted herein to Third Parties, its Subsidiaries, AWP, controlled Affiliates, or any holding company that is a direct or indirect parent of the Company provided there is reasonable justification. Each Party will attempt to ensure that any sublicense that it grants to a Sublicensee is generally aligned with the spirit of this Agreement. For clarity, granting a sublicense shall not necessarily relieve the Parties of any obligations hereunder, and each Party will endeavor to ensure Sublicensees’ compliance. A licensing Party reserves the right to audit Sublicensees and their compliance with this agreement if any concerns or complaints arise.",
                "explanation": "The original section on Sublicenses had stringent language. The modified version weakens this by adding the phrase “provided there is reasonable justification” for Company sublicenses, changing “Each Party shall ensure” to “Each Party will attempt to ensure”, replacing “shall not relieve” with “shall not necessarily relieve”, adding “will endeavor to ensure” instead of “shall remain responsible”, and allowing the licensing party to audit if 'any concerns or complaints arise'. This creates a conflict, making enforcement less predictable as to the standards imposed on sublicenses.",

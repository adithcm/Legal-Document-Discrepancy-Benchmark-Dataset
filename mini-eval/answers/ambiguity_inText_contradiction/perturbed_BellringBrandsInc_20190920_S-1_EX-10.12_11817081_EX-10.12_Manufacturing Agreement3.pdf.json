                "original_text": "All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered to Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A, which Schedule may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the “Specifications”), shall conform to Post Holding’s Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and shall conform in all material respects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage.",
                "changed_text": "All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall generally conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A and/or Schedule A-1, which Schedules may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the “Specifications”), and Heritage will use its best commercial efforts to conform to Post Holding’s Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E. Premier can reject Products if any individual unit of Product does not meet the Specifications, provided that no more than 5% of units can be rejected based on the Specifications.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict adherence to specifications. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'generally conform' and 'best commercial efforts,' weakening the requirement. In addition, the original language did not mention limitations to product rejection based on the specifications, while the changed text introduces a limitation that 'no more than 5% of units can be rejected based on the Specifications.' This creates a contradiction if another section of the agreement states that Premier may reject any non-conforming unit of Product.",

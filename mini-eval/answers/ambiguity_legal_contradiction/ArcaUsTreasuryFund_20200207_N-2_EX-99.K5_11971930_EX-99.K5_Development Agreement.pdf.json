                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the Blockchain Administrator 'shall ensure' conformity with laws. The modified text weakens this to 'will use its best efforts to ensure' and 'operates in general conformity,' making compliance less stringent and more subjective. Furthermore, replacing 'shall maintain' with 'will attempt to maintain' introduces ambiguity regarding the responsibility to maintain books and records.",

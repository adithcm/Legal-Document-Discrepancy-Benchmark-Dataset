        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to broaden the Sponsor's liability beyond what is legally permissible and contradicts standard legal principles regarding liability for errors of judgment. Typically, a party is not liable for errors in judgment unless there is also evidence of negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct. This section eliminates the requirement for such findings, making the Sponsor liable even for honest mistakes made in good faith. This is a significant deviation from the standard of care expected of investment advisors and could be considered an attempt to circumvent legal standards.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit Domini's liability for the actions of its subcontractors to cases of gross negligence only. This conflicts with the general legal principle that a party is responsible for the actions of its subcontractors. By including a statement that Domini is not 'fully responsible' and only liable for gross negligence, the contract weakens the Trust's ability to seek recourse for damages caused by subcontractors, even if the subcontractors are merely negligent. This could be viewed as an attempt to circumvent fiduciary duties and lower the standard of care.",

        "explanation": "The termination clause contains a significant discrepancy regarding the 'penalty' for termination. While the agreement allows both the Trust and the Sponsor to terminate with 60 days' notice, it imposes a penalty of one year's average management fees for early termination. This provision disproportionately affects the Trust, as the Sponsor could potentially terminate the agreement and receive a substantial payment, while the Trust terminating would incur a significant cost. This imbalance raises concerns about fairness and whether the provision is commercially reasonable, potentially opening it up to legal challenges.",

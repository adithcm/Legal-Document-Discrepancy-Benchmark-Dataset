        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever practical. The decision on whether to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT in a specific tournament will be at the sole discretion of the CONSULTANT based on performance considerations. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity regarding the exclusivity of product use. It states that the Consultant shall exclusively use Mandatory Products whenever practical, but then clarifies that the Consultant has sole discretion based on performance considerations. Furthermore, the clause explicitly allows the Consultant to play clubs from other manufacturers (including a putter) as long as they don't endorse them. This creates a contradiction. How can ADAMS GOLF claim the Consultant is exclusively using the mandatory product, if they do not endorse those clubs, or putter?",

The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****].",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency. It mandates that if the Consultant participates in [*****] sponsored photo shoots, they MUST wear ADAMS GOLF [*****]. However, it then restricts the consultant from being able to place a [*****] logo on their ADAMS GOLF product. This is inconsistent, how can the consultant wear ADAMS GOLF wear if they are endorsing the [*****] product. This restricts their ability to fully represent both endorsements.",

        "section": "1. DEFINITIONS. (c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "This definition of \"Customers\" is ambiguous and could lead to disputes. It defines a customer as someone who completes at least one transaction *per month*. This introduces an ongoing requirement, implying that a user ceases to be a \"Customer\" if they don't complete a transaction in a given month. This could significantly impact how advertising fees are calculated in Section 5.1, as the base is determined by average transaction from all Customers. This is an internal contradiction because the agreement uses 'Customers' without clarifying if it refers to all past customers or only active ones in a specific month. It makes the meaning of Customer vague, creating a contradiction in application.",

In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency regarding termination rights. The first sentence states that *either* party can terminate if the launch date doesn't occur within 4 months. The second sentence, however, restricts the termination right only to the party that *has* used good faith and reasonable efforts. This presents a contradiction because it's unclear whether both parties can terminate regardless of their efforts, or if only the diligent party can terminate. It's unclear if the termination is tied to who put in the work or not.",

A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.

        "explanation": "The repetition of the sentence \"A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.\" is a structural flaw. The sentence is only supposed to be stated once but is instead written twice. This is unnecessary and structurally incorrect.",

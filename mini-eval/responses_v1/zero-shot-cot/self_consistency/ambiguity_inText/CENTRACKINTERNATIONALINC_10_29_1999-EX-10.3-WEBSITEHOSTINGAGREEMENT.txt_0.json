        "explanation": "The contract states that i-on will maintain the Hosted Site continuously, 24/7, but then introduces an exception for necessary hardware and software maintenance. The phrase \"at its convenience, without prior notice\" creates ambiguity. While maintenance is a reasonable exception, performing it \"at its convenience\" and \"without prior notice\" could lead to extended or frequent downtimes, effectively contradicting the promise of continuous operation. The lack of specifics on the duration or frequency of maintenance windows leaves room for interpretation and potential disputes.",

        "explanation": "The contract states that i-on is not responsible for maintaining connectivity with the phone company and the internet backbone access provider. This is a contradiction because i-on is providing connectivity to the internet, and not being responsible for that connectivity will lead to issues.

Additional Web site administration services will be billed at $200 per hour.",
        "explanation": "The contract language is vague regarding the scope of included and billable services. While it lists several specific tasks included in the 1-hour free administration, the phrase \"consultation on site operation and administration\" is extremely broad. This creates ambiguity because almost any request could be classified as \"consultation\", allowing i-on to bill for services that the Customer might reasonably expect to be included in the free hour. It is unclear what is considered a consultation vs a question about server-side scripts.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section describes both renewal and termination conditions, but creates a conflict regarding the notice period. It states the agreement auto-renews for one-month periods unless 15-days notice is given. However, it also states that either party can terminate the agreement \"at any time\" with 30-days notice. This creates a contradiction: can the agreement be terminated with 30-days notice even during a renewed one-month term, effectively overriding the renewal clause, or does the 15-day notice requirement for preventing renewal take precedence.",

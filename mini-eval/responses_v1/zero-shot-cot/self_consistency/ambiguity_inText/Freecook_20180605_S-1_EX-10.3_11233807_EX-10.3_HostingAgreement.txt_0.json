        "explanation": "This statement is contradictory because, logically, due dates are *always* subject to potential delays. Unforeseen circumstances, material changes, or even simple miscommunication can cause delays in any project. To state that due dates are 'not subject to any delay' is unrealistic and unenforceable. It creates a contradiction with the practical realities of project management. It would be considered unenforceable under most contract laws because it is unreasonable.",

        "explanation": "The contract states that the client is to pay a reasonable sum, but it does not state the actual sum they are to pay. It is only stated in Section 2. Payment Terms, that the client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 on completion of the Scope of Work. It is implied that $5000 is the contract price, but it does not explicitiy state this. This is an omission of key information, and it makes it ambigious as to what the contract price is. It also makes the structure of the text unclear, and it does not make sense to only provide the full price later in the text, and not when it is first mentioned.",

This creates ambiguity and may lead to multiple interpretations. For example, does 'completion of the scope of work' mean the completion of all 3 stages, or completion of stage 1.

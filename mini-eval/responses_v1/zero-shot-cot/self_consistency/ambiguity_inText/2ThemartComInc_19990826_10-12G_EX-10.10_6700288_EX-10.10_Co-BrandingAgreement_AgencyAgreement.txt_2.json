        "section": "6.7 SERVICE STANDARDS. i-Escrow will comply with all laws and regulations and act as an Independent Escrow Agent as per the guidelines of California Escrow Law (California Financial Code Section17000 et seq., or its successor). Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This section establishes that California Escrow Law prevails in case of conflict, which is standard. However, it places the onus on i-Escrow to identify conflicts and notify 2TheMart. The ambiguity lies in 'reasonably believes such a conflict exists.' This is subjective and could lead to disputes. What constitutes a 'reasonable belief'? If i-Escrow fails to identify a conflict, can 2TheMart claim breach, even if i-Escrow was unaware or didn't 'reasonably believe' a conflict existed? The phrase weakens the legally binding nature of adhering to California Escrow Law.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The section repeats the sentence 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.' This repetition is a structural flaw that doesn't necessarily create a contradiction, but it introduces unnecessary redundancy and suggests a lack of careful editing. While not directly contradictory, it detracts from the clarity of the agreement.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of the indemnity clause limits indemnification to situations where the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. This drastically narrows the scope of indemnity. However, the subsequent sentences provide separate indemnities for 2TheMart regarding 2TheMart Content and for i-Escrow regarding i-Escrow Content and Services, without this 'principal' limitation. This creates a misalignment. Are these later indemnities subject to the 'principal' limitation in the first sentence, or are they independent indemnities covering all claims arising from the specified content/services? This misalignment makes the scope of the indemnity obligation unclear.",

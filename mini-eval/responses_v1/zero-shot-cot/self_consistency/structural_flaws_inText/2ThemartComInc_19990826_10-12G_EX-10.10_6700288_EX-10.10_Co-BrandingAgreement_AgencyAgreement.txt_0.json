        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "This section gives i-Escrow complete discretion over the advertising fees paid to 2TheMart. It states that the per Transaction Inquiry amount is calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion and can be revised to reflect market conditions, also at i-Escrow's discretion. The final sentence explicitly says i-Escrow can adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent. This effectively means that 2TheMart has no control or negotiation power over the fees they receive, which contradicts the implied good faith and fair dealing expected in contractual relationships. While contracts can favor one party, this level of unilateral control over payment terms creates an imbalance that could be deemed unconscionable or indicative of a lack of mutual agreement on essential terms.",

        "explanation": "This statement is a direct contradiction. The first part states that each party shall hold the other's confidential information in confidence, implying a duty to protect and not disclose it. However, the phrase 'except that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time' completely negates the initial statement. If a party can disclose confidential information at any time to any third party, there is effectively no confidentiality agreement in place. This creates an internal inconsistency that undermines the purpose of having a confidentiality clause.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated' is a structural flaw and does not make sense. Based on the statements prior, both parties would need to agree to renew the contract, not one of the parties. Thus, there would have to be confirmation from each party in order for the agreement to be renewed. If at least one of the parties does not agree to renew the contract, then the agreement will be considered terminated.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to clarify the Sponsor's responsibilities by stating what they are NOT responsible for. However, the language is broad and could be interpreted to contradict some of the duties outlined in Section 1. For example, Section 1(h) requires the Sponsor to provide reports and assistance regarding each series' compliance with securities laws and investment objectives. This could arguably be interpreted as being related to the management of the Trust's assets or rendering investment advice, creating a potential ambiguity as to the scope of the Sponsor's responsibilities. Further, Section 1(c) tasks the sponsor with monitoring and coordinating the performance of the Trust's transfer agent, custodian, etc. This introduces more ambiguity.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of Section 6 states that the agreement may be terminated at any time without penalty. However, the second sentence directly contradicts this by stating that a penalty *will* be applied if the Sponsor terminates the agreement within the first year. This creates an internal inconsistency.",

Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit Domini's liability for the acts of subcontractors. However, the phrasing presents potential issues. Limiting responsibility to the extent of the subcontractor's liability insurance could be problematic if the insurance coverage is insufficient to cover damages resulting from the subcontractor's actions. This limitation might not be enforceable under certain state laws, especially if Domini was negligent in selecting or supervising the subcontractor. Furthermore, stating that Domini is not responsible for acts outside the scope of contracted services could be interpreted ambiguously. It is unclear who defines \"the scope of contracted services\". If a subcontractor's action, even if negligent, arguably falls within the broad scope of the services, Domini might still be held liable.",

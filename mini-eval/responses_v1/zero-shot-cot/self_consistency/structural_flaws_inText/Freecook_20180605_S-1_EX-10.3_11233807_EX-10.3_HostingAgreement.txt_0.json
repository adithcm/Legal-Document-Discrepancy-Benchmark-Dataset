        "explanation": "This statement is contradictory and unrealistic. It asserts that the Company guarantees due dates in the Scope of Work, irrespective of whether the Client provides necessary materials or approvals on time. This is an in-text contradiction because project timelines are inherently dependent on the Client's input. If the Client is late providing content or approvals, it's illogical and practically impossible for the Company to still guarantee the original due dates. This creates confusion about the enforceability of deadlines.",

        "explanation": "This section presents an in-text contradiction concerning the payment schedule. It initially states that the remaining $3,100 is due upon completion of the Scope of Work. However, the subsequent sentence allows the Client to pay this amount in installments or at any time before completion. This contradicts the initial statement, creating confusion about the actual payment terms and when the final payment is definitively due. It is also ambigious, as it does not give a time limit on when the installments must be completed by.",

        "explanation": "This section is contradictory. It first states that the Company is obligated to continue providing Customer Service and cannot alter or cease it. However, it then immediately states that the Company can, at its sole discretion, alter or cease providing Customer Service without any liability. This creates a direct contradiction, making the Customer Service obligation unenforceable. The terms are structually flawed as they do not make sense.",

        "explanation": "This statement creates a contradiction because it allows either joint venturer to unilaterally demand capital contributions from the other, regardless of whether the other party agrees. This goes against the general principle of joint ventures, which typically require mutual agreement on significant financial decisions.",

A Joint Venturer may unilaterally withdraw funds or property from the Joint Venture at any time, regardless of the other Joint Venturer's consent. However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction. It first states that a Joint Venturer may unilaterally withdraw funds, then restricts this withdrawal to 10% of their capital contribution per quarter. This creates ambiguity about whether other forms of withdrawals are permitted beyond the 10% threshold, and what terms 'all other distributions' refer to. The clause 'all other distributions will adhere to the original terms' is vauge.",

        "explanation": "This section establishes a termination clause that allows either party to terminate the joint venture with 30 days' notice. However, the phrase \"regardless of the original termination date\" introduces ambiguity. There is no defined original termination date mentioned in the document. This makes the intended meaning of this clause unclear.",

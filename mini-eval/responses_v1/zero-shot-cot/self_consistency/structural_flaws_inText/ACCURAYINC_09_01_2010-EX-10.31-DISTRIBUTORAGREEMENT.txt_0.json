For the avoidance of doubt, 'Accuray Regions' shall only refer to North America.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Accuray Regions\" initially includes several regions but then explicitly states that it shall only refer to North America. This creates a direct contradiction within the definition itself, making it unclear which regions are actually included in \"Accuray Regions\" for the purposes of the agreement.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray. The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address: Accuray Incorporated ATTN: Contracts Administration 1310 Chesapeake Terrace Sunnyvale, CA 94089 Main: (408) 716-4600 Fax: (408) 789-4205 Email: Orders@accuray.com 2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.3.3 states that failure by Accuray to approve or disapprove a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, Section 2.3.4 allows the Distributor to cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not *executed* it within two weeks.  Disapproval and non-execution are different concepts. Accuray could approve the Purchase Order but not execute it within two weeks, creating a situation where the Distributor's cancellation right is unclear. If the Purchase order is not executed in the two week timeline, this creates a contradiction between the two sections and ambiguity.",

        "section": "4.6. Warranty. 4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",
        "explanation": "The last two sentences of Section 4.6.1 create a contradiction. The first of these sentences states that, except for the limited warranty described, Accuray makes no other warranties. The following sentence, however, states that Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product. This is a much broader warranty than the one-year/eighteen-month warranty described earlier in the section and contradicts the disclaimer of other warranties.",

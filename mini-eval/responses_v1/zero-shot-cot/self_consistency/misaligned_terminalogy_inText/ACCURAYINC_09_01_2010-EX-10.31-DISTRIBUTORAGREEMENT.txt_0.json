        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The first part of the statement says that Accuray must reject or accept a purchase order within 2 weeks or else it is considered disapproval, while the last statement indicates that a purchase order can only be accepted through execution, which implies a longer process than a simple acceptance within two weeks. This discrepancy could lead to confusion about the actual acceptance process and timeline.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the responsibility for expedited shipping costs. It states that if the requested delivery date is at least six months after the purchase order submission, Accuray bears the cost. However, if the date is less than six months, the Distributor bears the cost. This is clear, but the subsequent examples confuse the matter, because they use delivery dates of December 1 and October 1 to be compared with a purchase order date of June 1, so it seems to imply that the delivery dates must be the first of the month, which is not clear. This section should have been written better.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\").",
        "explanation": "This section states that the warranty is for one year following installation, but cannot exceed 18 months after shipment to the distributor. This discrepancy arises when installation is delayed. If installation takes longer than six months after shipment, the customer receives less than a one-year warranty, because the 18 month 'not to exceed' clause cuts into the warranty time. This should be clarified.",

        "explanation": "The use of 'may' suggests that the Sponsor's performance of oversight, administrative, and management services is discretionary, which contradicts the Sponsor's overall duty to provide these services as outlined in the agreement. This discretionary language undermines the binding nature of the agreement.",

        "explanation": "This sentence is a structural mess. 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series,' This does not make sense because it is implying they will be fully responsible for managing the Trust's assets, however it is a negative statement which implies that they will not be responsible.

        "explanation": "The allocation of expenses is contradictory. The first sentence states Domini pays salaries of Trust's Trustees/officers who work for Domini, explicitly excluding these salaries from Trust's expenses. The next sentence states The Trust pays all of its operating expenses. This is contradictory and shows inconsistencies in the text.",

        "explanation": "The condition for termination is vague. The agreement states 'This Agreement may be terminated at any time', however, it continues by stating 'in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party'. This implies the agreement can only be terminated at any time, if there is 60 days written notice, thus creating a contradiction and making the previous statement untrue.",

        "explanation": "This section does not make sense as it is a structural flaw. It starts of by giving Domini the ability to subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations, with the condition that 'Domini shall not enter into any such subcontract unless the Trustees of the Trust shall have found the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted'. It then states 'unless the Trust otherwise expressly agrees in writing, Domini shall be as fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor as it would be for its own acts or omissions'.

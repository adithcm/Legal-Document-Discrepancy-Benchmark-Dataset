        "explanation": "The terms 'Customer' and 'subscriber' are used interchangeably in this section, but it is not explicitly stated that they refer to the same entity. While it is heavily implied, the lack of a clear definition could lead to confusion or dispute, particularly if there were a situation where a third party was subscribing on behalf of the Customer.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.",
        "explanation": "The contract initially states that the agreement is for a period of six months from April 1, 1999. It then states that the agreement is automatically renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods, creating an inconsistency. It's unclear if the intention is for the contract to always renew for only one month at a time or if it can renew for multiple months at once. This could lead to disputes about the length of the renewal period.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due to i-on and to make such payments on a timely basis.",
        "explanation": "This section seems to contradict itself. It states that either party can terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice, but then states that the customer is still responsible for paying all amounts due even after termination. This creates confusion as to whether the customer is responsible for paying the entire amount of the contract even if they are not using the services. This is unclear and not structured properly.",

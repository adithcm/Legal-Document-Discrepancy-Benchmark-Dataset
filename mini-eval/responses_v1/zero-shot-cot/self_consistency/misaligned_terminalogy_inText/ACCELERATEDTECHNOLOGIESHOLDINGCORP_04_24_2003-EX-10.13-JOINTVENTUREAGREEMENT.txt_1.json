        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Participant shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Investor shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "The terms 'Joint Venturers,' 'Participant,' and 'Investor' are used seemingly interchangeably in this section. While it can be inferred that they all refer to CCGI and PVSS, the contract does not explicitly define 'Participant' and 'Investor' or clarify that they are synonymous with 'Joint Venturers.' This lack of clear definition creates potential for confusion and disputes, particularly if one party later argues that 'Investor' has a different meaning or scope of responsibility than 'Joint Venturer.' This is a contradiction because it implies that participants are not entitled to compensation but investors are reimbursed. Who are the investors?",

        "explanation": "This sentence uses the terms 'Goods,' 'Partnership,' 'Syndicate,' and 'Owner' without clearly defining them within the context of the Joint Venture Agreement. While 'Goods' could reasonably be inferred to refer to the Products, 'Partnership,' 'Syndicate,' and 'Owner' are not defined and appear to contradict the explicitly stated intent in Section 10 that the agreement does not create a partnership. The reference to a 'Syndicate' and 'Owner' is particularly problematic as these terms are completely foreign to the defined structure of the joint venture and could lead to disputes about the intended meaning of the clause.",

        "explanation": "This section defines the term of the joint venture but does not state what will happen if there is no written agreement made before the 30 days prior to termination. This could lead to legal loopholes, as they should have accounted for what happens if there is no extension. Due to the high importance of this clause, it is important to mention all details.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding the renewal process. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term. However, it further states that the agreement will be automatically renewed for another one (1) year if neither party gives notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term. These two statements contradict each other, as the first requires a mutual agreement for renewal, while the second implies an automatic renewal unless notice is given.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the Indemnified Party: (i) giving the Indemnifying Party notice of the relevant claim, (ii) cooperating with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in the defense of such claim, and (iii) giving the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense and settlement of any such claim, except that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that affects the Indemnified Party's rights or interest without the Indemnified Party's prior written approval. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense at its expense.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence's condition that 'the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor' introduces ambiguity. The rest of the indemnity clause extends protections beyond this key agent relationship, leading to multiple interpretations and confusion. The term 'key agent' is not defined and thus leaves the legal statement vague and open to interpretation.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\u201cthe Revised Pricing\u201d). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period\" is ambiguous because it does not specify whose customer base is being referenced. It is unclear whether the median revenue is calculated based on i-Escrow's customers, 2TheMart's customers, or the Co-Branded Site's customers. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to determine the basis for calculating advertising fees, which introduces ambiguity into the contract.",

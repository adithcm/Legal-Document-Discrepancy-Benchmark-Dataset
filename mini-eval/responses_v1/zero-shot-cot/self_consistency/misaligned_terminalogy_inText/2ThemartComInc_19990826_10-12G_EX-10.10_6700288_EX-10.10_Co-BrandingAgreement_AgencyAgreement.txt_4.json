        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It states that the agreement may be renewed by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term. However, it then states that the term shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year if neither party gives notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before expiration. These two statements create a contradiction: renewal requires mutual agreement versus automatic renewal.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The initial sentence establishes a general indemnity obligation for each party towards the other, contingent on the 'Protected Party' being considered a 'key agent' of the 'Guarantor.' This condition significantly narrows the scope of the indemnity. The subsequent sentences then provide specific indemnity obligations: 2TheMart indemnifying i-Escrow for liabilities arising from 2TheMart Material, and i-Escrow indemnifying 2TheMart for liabilities arising from i-Escrow Media and Deliverables. These specific obligations do not reiterate the 'key agent' condition, implying that the indemnity applies regardless of whether the 'Protected Party' is a 'key agent.' This creates an inconsistency, as it is unclear whether the 'key agent' condition applies to the specific indemnities or only to the general indemnity outlined in the first sentence.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The formula for calculating advertising fees is ambiguous because 'median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period' is vague. It is not defined how the 'median revenue per customer' is calculated. This needs to be clearly defined. Also, the definition of Customer Engagements should be mentioned in the definitions at the top, since it is a key term.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Accuray has two weeks to either accept or reject a Purchase Order, and that failure to do so constitutes disapproval. However, the subsequent sentence states that a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This implies that acceptance requires an affirmative action (execution), which contradicts the earlier statement that inaction (failure to respond) also constitutes disapproval. This creates ambiguity because it's unclear whether a lack of response is a clear disapproval or whether an executed Purchase Order is needed to prove acceptance.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses responsibility for expedited shipping costs when meeting Purchase Order delivery deadlines. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, Accuray bears the costs. However, the example provided contradicts this rule. The example states that if a Purchase Order is submitted on June 1, with delivery requested by December 1 (exactly six months), Accuray bears the costs. Conversely, if delivery is requested by October 1 (less than six months), Distributor bears the costs. The contradiction lies in whether a six-month deadline is inclusive or exclusive - the language suggests inclusive, but the examples act as if it is exclusive.",

        "section": "5.4.1. System Purchase Payments. Payment for the purchase of a System shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars in the form of either (1) an irrevocable trade finance letter of credit or (2) wire transfer as further described in Sections 5.4.1.1 (Letter of Credit) and 5.4.1.2 (Wire Transfer), respectively below. Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "In section 5.4.1, it is stated that Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. However, in section 5.4.2, it is stated that Accuray shall bear the cost of any commission charge for a wire transfer. The first discrepancy is that section 5.4.1 states that Accuray will absorb both letter of credit and wire transfer fees. Then in section 5.4.2 it only accounts for wire transfer fees. The second discrepancy is that the language used to describe who absorbs the charges is inconsistent. Section 5.4.1 uses the word 'charges', while section 5.4.2 uses the word 'commission'.",

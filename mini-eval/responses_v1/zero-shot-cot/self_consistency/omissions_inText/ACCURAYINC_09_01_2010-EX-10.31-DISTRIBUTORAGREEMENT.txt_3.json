        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section provides contradictory statements regarding who bears the supplementary shipping costs when expedited delivery is required to meet the delivery deadline. The paragraph states that Accuray bears the costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission, but then the example shows that if a purchase order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, Accuray bears the cost. This is a contridiction because the the wording in the example restates the previous sentence. ",

Notwithstanding Section 4.6.2, for a period of 10 years following Installation of a System, Accuray will provide to Customer, without charge, Bug Fixes with respect to any software included in the System. This is Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective software. By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Bug Fixes available to Customer, and Accuray shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or implementation of such Bug Fixes at the Customer's site. \"Bug Fix\" means an error correction or minor change in the existing software and/or hardware configuration that is required in order to enable the existing software and/or hardware configuration to perform to the existing functional specification(s).",
        "explanation": "The definition of Bug Fix mentions 'software and/or hardware configuration'. This is a misalignment since the beginning of the section states that Bug Fixes are provided with respect to any *software* included in the System. The definition of Bug Fix should only refer to software, to align with the scope defined in the initial statement.",

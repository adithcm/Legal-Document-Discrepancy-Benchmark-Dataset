These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The first part of the statement says that the Sponsor will perform management services as requested by the Trust. However, the statement goes on to say that the Sponsor will not be responsible for the management of the Trust's assets. This creates an ambiguity in text as the term management is inconsistently defined, which creates an internal contradiction.",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",

It states that Domini will pay the salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini or its affiliates, while the Trust pays all other operating expenses. There is an omission in text as it omits which party is responsible for the wages of people who do not affiliate with Domini, while other sections still reference it, creating an internal contradiction.",

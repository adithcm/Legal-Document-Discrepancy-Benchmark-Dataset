        "section": "Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Additional Work\" includes both revisions requiring more than two rounds *and* substantial revisions, suggesting these are separate conditions. However, it's unclear if 'substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client' applies only when these revisions require more than two rounds, or if *any* substantial revisions, even within two rounds, would constitute additional work. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine when change orders are required.",

Does it only apply to feedback given without any prompting at all, or does it include feedback given after a general request for feedback, but without specifically asking for a testimonial? This could lead to disputes over whether feedback was truly unsolicited and therefore usable for marketing purposes.",

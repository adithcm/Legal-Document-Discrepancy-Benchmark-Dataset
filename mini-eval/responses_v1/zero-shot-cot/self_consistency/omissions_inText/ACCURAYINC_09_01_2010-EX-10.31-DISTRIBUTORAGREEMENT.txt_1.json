It simply states that it means \"a purchase,\" offering no clarification or specific meaning. This lack of a clear definition creates ambiguity regarding the scope and application of the term within the agreement, potentially leading to disputes over which purchases qualify under this definition.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray. The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address: Accuray Incorporated ATTN: Contracts Administration 1310 Chesapeake Terrace Sunnyvale, CA 94089 Main: (408) 716-4600 Fax: (408) 789-4205 Email: Orders@accuray.com 2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.3.3 states that failure to approve or disapprove a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, Section 2.3.4 provides that the Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not *executed* it within two weeks. Execution implies a higher level of action than simple approval. This creates a contradiction: is the Purchase Order considered disapproved (and thus potentially cancellable or requiring further action) if it's not *approved* within two weeks, or only if it's not *executed* within that time? The differing standards create ambiguity about the timeline and requirements for a valid purchase.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the responsibility for expedited shipping costs based on the delivery deadline requested in the Purchase Order. It states that if the requested delivery date is at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order, Accuray bears the expedited costs. However, the second half of the section contradicts itself. The 'December 1' delivery is an example of meeting the 6-month deadline, meaning Accuray bears the cost, while the 'October 1' delivery is an example of missing the 6-month deadline, meaning Distributor bears the cost.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding renewal. First, it states that the agreement may be renewed by mutual written agreement. Then, it states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal, the agreement will be automatically renewed. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual method for renewal: is a written agreement required, or is the absence of a non-renewal notice sufficient?",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence limits the indemnity obligation to situations where the Indemnified Party is 'deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party'. This is a very specific and unusual limitation on indemnity. The subsequent sentences remove this limitation when it comes to content or the services provided. The language 'In addition' makes it seem like the limitation no longer applies to the rest of the paragraph when it comes to content or services. This creates ambiguity regarding the scope of the initial indemnity obligation. Does it apply to all claims, or only those where a principal-agent relationship exists?",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "While stating that California Escrow Law should prevail, there's an omission of a specific legal obligation or a consumer protection that is legally mandated under California Escrow Law. This omission could lead to the contract being non-compliant if it doesn't explicitly incorporate all the required protections and obligations.",

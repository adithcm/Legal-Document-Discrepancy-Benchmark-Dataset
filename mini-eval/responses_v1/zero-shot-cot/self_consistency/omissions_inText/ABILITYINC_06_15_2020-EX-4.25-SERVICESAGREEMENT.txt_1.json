        "section": "1.2 Standard of Service. (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "The requirement that Provider Representatives be 'dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient' and 'shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider' creates an inconsistency. While seemingly straightforward, the provider is contracted as an independent contractor and should be able to work for anyone they want as long as they provide the agreed upon services, but this makes the Provider representatives employees rather than contractors. This is a discrepancy because it attempts to limit the Provider Representatives' activities beyond what is reasonable for an independent contractor relationship. This makes them employees.",

        "explanation": "This section states the agreement will terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2. Section 3.2 allows either party to terminate the agreement 'at any time without cause' by providing at least 90 days' prior written notice. This presents a contradiction: if a party can terminate 'at any time', it implies the agreement could extend beyond December 31, 2020, if notice is given before that date, however section 3.1 states it will terminate on December 31, 2020 no matter what.",

        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it does not specify what happens if the Joint Venturers do not mutually agree on capital contributions. Does this mean the joint venture cannot proceed, or are there alternative funding mechanisms? The lack of clarity creates uncertainty about the financial obligations of each party.",

        "explanation": "This clause introduces a power imbalance, granting Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. unilateral authority in asset valuation during liquidation. This could lead to unfair distribution of assets if CCGI undervalues assets to their benefit, potentially disadvantaging Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. This creates a structural flaw in the fairness of the liquidation process.",

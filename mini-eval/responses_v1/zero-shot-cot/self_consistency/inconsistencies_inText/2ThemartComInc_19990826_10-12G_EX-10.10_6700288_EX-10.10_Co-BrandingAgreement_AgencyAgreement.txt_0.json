        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term', which means both parties need to agree in writing before the current term ends. However, it then states 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year'. This contradicts the first statement because it implies automatic renewal even without mutual written agreement, simply if neither party provides notice of non-renewal.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The ability for 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising rate paid by i-Escrow introduces ambiguity and potential inequity. The phrase 'to reflect present market conditions' is vague and doesn't provide clear guidelines for how the rate will be adjusted. This lack of specificity could lead to disputes, as i-Escrow has no control over or input into these adjustments, potentially making the financial obligations unpredictable. This could be viewed as an unfair business practice depending on jurisdiction.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section has contradictory terms. It states that upon termination or expiration 'all rights granted herein shall terminate' and then also states 'Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.'. This is contradictory because 8.5 is the effects of termination so if the section does not survive then that means that the effects of termination are not in effect. This is an in-text contradiction.",

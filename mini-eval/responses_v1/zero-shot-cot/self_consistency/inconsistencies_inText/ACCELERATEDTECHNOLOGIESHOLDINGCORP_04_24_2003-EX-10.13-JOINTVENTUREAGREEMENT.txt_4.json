        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This clause creates ambiguity. While it states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon, it doesn't specify what happens if the Joint Venture needs capital and no mutual agreement is reached. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes if the Joint Venture faces financial difficulties and requires capital infusions to continue operating.",

        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction in the language regarding distributions. The first part of Section 9 states that distributions can only be made if assets exceed liabilities. However, the section then states that PVSS is entitled to a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability. This means PVSS will receive $10,000 every month, even if the Joint Venture is in debt. This contradicts the clause stating distributions can only be made if assets exceed liabilities.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the procedure for asset distribution upon termination. However, it grants Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. (CCGI) the final say on asset valuation during liquidation disputes. This arrangement creates a potential conflict of interest, as CCGI could undervalue assets to their advantage, thereby diminishing the other party's (PVSS) share. This power imbalance contradicts the principle of equal distribution based on prorata ownership and creates an unfair advantage for CCGI during the liquidation process.",

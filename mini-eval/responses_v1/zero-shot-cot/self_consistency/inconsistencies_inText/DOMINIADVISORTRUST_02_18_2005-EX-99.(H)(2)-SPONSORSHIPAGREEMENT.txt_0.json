        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the allocation of charges and expenses between Domini and the Trust. Domini covers salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who dedicate their time to Domini's affairs, compensation of unaffiliated Trustees, and legal counsel fees. The Trust covers all other operating expenses. However, the phrase \"legal counsel fees which Domini will cover\" is ambiguous. It's unclear whether Domini covers all legal counsel fees or only a specific portion, potentially leading to disputes over financial responsibility.",

        "explanation": "Section 2 states Domini will cover legal counsel fees, but doesn't specify the scope. Later, the section includes 'fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants' in the list of expenses the Trust pays. Legal counsel fees can overlap with these areas (e.g., legal advice related to audits), which creates an ambiguity. This can lead to disputes about whether specific legal fees should be covered by Domini or the Trust, particularly if they relate to auditing or accounting matters. The lack of clarity on which legal fees Domini covers could result in disagreements and potential legal challenges.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines the conditions for terminating the agreement, stating that either party (the Board of Trustees or the Sponsor) can terminate at any time with 60 days' written notice and a $10,000 penalty. The phrase 'at any time' contradicts the requirement of 60 days' written notice. The 'at any time' clause suggests immediate termination, while the 60-day notice period implies a delay. The inclusion of 'at any time' introduces ambiguity and could lead to disputes over the effective date of termination.",

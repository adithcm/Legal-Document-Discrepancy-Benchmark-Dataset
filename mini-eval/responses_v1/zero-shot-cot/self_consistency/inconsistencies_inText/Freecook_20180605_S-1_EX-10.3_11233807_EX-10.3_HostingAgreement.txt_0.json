Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The text presents contradictory statements regarding the project timeline. It initially states that the company will use its best efforts to deliver the website within 12 weeks (February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018) but then guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays. This creates confusion regarding the actual guaranteed completion time and what constitutes a delay that triggers penalties. Is it after 8 weeks or after 12 weeks?",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "The text describes how the surcharge for rush work will be calculated, indicating either 'the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.' However, 25% of $40 is $10, therefore $40 plus $10 equals $50. Therefore, $50 is always lower than $100, so the 'flat fee of $100' is irrelevant. This creates ambiguity because the company would always choose $50 instead of $100, and is misleading.",

Upon the signing of this Agreement, Client agrees to pay to Company a total of $5,000. Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 according to the following milestone schedule: $1,000 upon completion of Stage 1 of the Scope of Work, $1,000 upon completion of Stage 2, and $1,100 upon completion of Stage 3.",
        "explanation": "While the text states that the total cost for the company is $5,000, the breakdown of payment does not add up correctly. The upfront payment of $1,900 plus the milestone payments of $1,000, $1,000 and $1,100 adds up to $5,000. However, it states that the client will pay a prepayment of $1,900 'and pay the remaining $3,100 according to the following milestone schedule.' The total cost of the website is $5,000 - the pre-payment of $1,900 = $3,100, according to the document. This could mislead the reader.",

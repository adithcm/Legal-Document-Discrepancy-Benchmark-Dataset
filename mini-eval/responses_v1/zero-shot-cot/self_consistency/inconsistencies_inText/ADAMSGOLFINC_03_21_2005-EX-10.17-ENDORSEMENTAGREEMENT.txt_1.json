        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section creates an in-text contradiction. The first sentence states that the consultant must exclusively use MANDATORY PRODUCT, but the second sentence creates an exception allowing the consultant to play clubs other than ADAMS GOLF clubs, including a putter by another manufacturer. This contradicts the initial exclusivity requirement.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory because it first states that if the inability to play is due to an injury at an Adams Golf event, no repayment is required. However, it then states that upon termination, the consultant's estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the period not performed. This creates an inconsistency.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "This section is structurally flawed.  The description states CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play, but the description does not define what a satisfactory record of play is. This lack of definition makes the contractual obligation vague and difficult to enforce.",

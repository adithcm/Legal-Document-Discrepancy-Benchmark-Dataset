The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 20th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The statement that fees are due by the '20th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999' is ambiguous because April 1, 1999 is the start date of the contract, not the day of the month payment begins. It is unclear if payment is due the 20th day of the current month or of the next month. This could lead to disputes over late payment penalties.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than five (5) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The text creates an ambiguity. The agreement can be renewed for one month, but also terminated within 30 days without cause. It is not explicitly stated if the renewal can take effect during the 30 day termination window without penalty. If the agreement is terminated within the 30 day termination window, it is not clear if the customer still owes payment for the entirety of the next month or only up until the termination date.",

        "explanation": "The statement that the agreement renews for 'one (1) or more one (1) month periods' and requires 'not less than five (5) days' notice' for non-renewal is structurally flawed. The phrase 'one or more' is grammatically incorrect because it suggests the possibility of renewing for a fraction of a month. The renewal structure is unclear; renewals should state the exact period, eliminating 'or more'.",

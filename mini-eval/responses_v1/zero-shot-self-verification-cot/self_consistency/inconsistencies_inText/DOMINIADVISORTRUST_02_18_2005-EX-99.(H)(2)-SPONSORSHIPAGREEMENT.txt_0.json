        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.",
        "explanation": "The allocation of expenses between Domini and the Trust appears inconsistent. Domini covers salaries for Trustees, officers, and agents devoting time to Domini's affairs. However, the Trust covers all operating expenses except Sponsor fees, compensation for Trustees *not* affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees covered by Domini. This implies the Trust *does* cover compensation for Trustees affiliated with the Sponsor, creating a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The agreement states that it can be terminated at any time with a 60-day notice AND a $10,000 penalty. This contradicts the general understanding that a contract termination typically involves fulfilling obligations or paying damages *if* there is a breach or early termination without cause. The phrase \"at any time\" suggests no specific cause is needed, but the penalty introduces ambiguity. Is the penalty meant to be an option to terminate without cause, or does it apply even if there's a valid reason for termination? This creates a contradiction in that one phrase states at any time, but the other puts a restriction on that time.",

        "explanation": "This statement may present a legal issue. Generally, while a party can subcontract obligations, they often remain ultimately responsible for ensuring those obligations are properly fulfilled. A blanket statement absolving Domini of all responsibility for subcontractor actions, even negligent ones, could be unenforceable or problematic under agency law principles. A prudent contract would typically include language requiring Domini to exercise due diligence in selecting and overseeing subcontractors. By not doing so, it creates a potential contradiction with implied duties of good faith and reasonable care.",

However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting statements regarding the project timeline. It first states that the company will use its 'best efforts' to deliver the website within 12 weeks (February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018). However, it then guarantees completion within 8 weeks and mentions penalties for delays beyond this 8-week timeframe. This creates an inconsistency: is the target delivery 12 weeks with 'best efforts', or a guaranteed 8 weeks with penalties?",

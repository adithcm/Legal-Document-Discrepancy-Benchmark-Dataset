The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 20th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The second sentence states that the customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 20th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. This statement is vague because it does not specify which April 1, 1999 it refers to. This statement is confusing and unclear.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement for the Hosted Site shall commence upon April 1, 1999 and shall continue for a period of six (6) months, unless earlier terminated in accordance with provisions hereof. This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than five (5) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due to i-on and to make such payments on a timely basis.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that it renews for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than five (5) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. There is an ambiguity of the agreement renewing for more than one month. Does it renew for only one month at a time? Or multiple months at a time.",

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'reasonable steps' is ambiguous and undefined within the contract. What constitutes 'reasonable steps' to protect against data loss is open to interpretation, making it difficult to enforce this provision. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about whether i-on adequately protected the customer's data.",

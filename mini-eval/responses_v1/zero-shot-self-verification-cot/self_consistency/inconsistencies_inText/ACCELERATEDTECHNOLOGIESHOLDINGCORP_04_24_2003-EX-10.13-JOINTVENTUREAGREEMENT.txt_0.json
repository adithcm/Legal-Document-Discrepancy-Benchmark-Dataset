        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, Section 9 later mentions that no interest shall be allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. This implies that there *could* be a contribution, even though Section 3 suggests it's not required without mutual consent. This creates ambiguity - are contributions optional or are they expected under certain circumstances?",

        "explanation": "This sentence is a structural flaw because it is worded poorly and hard to understand. What is meant by the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture?",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "Section 9 generally discusses distributions based on pro-rata interest and profitability. However, this sentence introduces an exception: PVSS receives a guaranteed payment regardless of profitability. This contradicts the earlier implication that distributions are dependent on the Joint Venture's financial success and the pro rata ownership.",

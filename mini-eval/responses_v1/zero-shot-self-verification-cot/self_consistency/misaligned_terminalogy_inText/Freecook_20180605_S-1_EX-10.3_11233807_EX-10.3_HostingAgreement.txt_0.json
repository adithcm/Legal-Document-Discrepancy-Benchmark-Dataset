        "explanation": "The contract mentions an accompanying Scope of Work (Exhibit A) that outlines the specific design and development tasks. However, subsequent clauses like 1(a) discuss 'changes to the Scope of Work', implying the Scope of Work can be altered after the agreement is signed. This creates ambiguity because it doesn't specify the process for agreeing upon the *initial* Scope of Work. If the initial Scope of Work is not clearly defined and agreed upon before signing, it leads to uncertainty regarding what the Client is initially paying for, and what constitutes 'Additional Work'.",

        "explanation": "The contract states the remaining $3,100 is due upon 'completion of the Scope of Work.' However, the term 'completion' is not specifically defined. It is ambiguous as to what constitutes full completion. Does 'completion' mean the delivery of the website, final approval by the client, or something else? Without a clear definition, disputes could arise as to when the final payment is actually due. The lack of clarity on what constitutes \"completion of the Scope of Work\" introduces ambiguity and increases the potential for disputes regarding the final payment.",

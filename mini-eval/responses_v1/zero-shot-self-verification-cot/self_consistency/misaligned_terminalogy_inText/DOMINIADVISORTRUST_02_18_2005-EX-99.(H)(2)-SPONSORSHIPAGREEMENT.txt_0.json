The phrase starts by stating that the Sponsor is fully responsible for the management of the Trust's assets. The sentence then goes on to say the sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed or have any responsiblity. This directly contradicts the first half of the sentence, rendering the sentence nonsensical and legally ambiguous.",

        "explanation": "The initial part of Section 1 outlines various duties of the Sponsor, using permissive language (\"may perform\"). However, the subsequent sentence starting with \"Notwithstanding the foregoing\" could be interpreted as creating confusion regarding the Sponsor's *actual* responsibilities. The use of 'shall also be fully responsible' seems to contradict the permissive nature of the initial duties and could be seen as attempting to broaden the scope of liability in a way that is inconsistent with the preceding language.",

The phrase states that if Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated.

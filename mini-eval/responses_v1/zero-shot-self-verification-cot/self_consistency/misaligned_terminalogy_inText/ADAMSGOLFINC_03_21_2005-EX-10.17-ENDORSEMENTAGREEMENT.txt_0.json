The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and potential inconsistencies because it allows Watson to endorse another product ([*****]) despite the exclusivity clause in sections 4A, 4B, and 4C. The specific terms and limitations of this endorsement are unclear due to the redactions. The phrase \"consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice\" is vague and could lead to disputes over what constitutes acceptable endorsement activity. Additionally, the remedy Watson must take if the use varies from past practice is redacted, making enforcement uncertain.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "While Section 5 mandates the exclusive use of MANDATORY PRODUCTS, it also allows Watson to use other clubs, including a putter from a different manufacturer, as long as he doesn't endorse them. This creates a potential conflict. What constitutes \"endorsement\" in this context is not clearly defined. Could simply using a non-Adams Golf putter in a televised tournament be interpreted as an implied endorsement, thus violating the agreement? This lack of clarity creates ambiguity.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "The key phrase \"satisfactory record of play\" is not defined within the contract. This omission creates significant ambiguity. Without a clear definition, ADAMS GOLF could potentially argue that Watson's performance, even if he participates in the minimum number of events, is not \"satisfactory\" and demand repayment. The subjective nature of this term makes the repayment clause prone to dispute.",

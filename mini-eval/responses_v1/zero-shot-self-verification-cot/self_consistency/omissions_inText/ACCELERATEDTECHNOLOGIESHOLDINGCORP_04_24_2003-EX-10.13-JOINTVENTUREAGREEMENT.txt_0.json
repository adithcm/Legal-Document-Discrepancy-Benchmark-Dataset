        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it doesn't specify how the need for capital contributions is determined, who decides when contributions are 'needed,' or how the amount of each contribution is calculated. The lack of clarity could lead to disputes between the Joint Venturers regarding their obligations.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement grants each Joint Venturer unilateral authority to execute instruments, which is extremely broad. It doesn't define what constitutes an 'instrument' or place any limitations on the value or type of transaction that either Joint Venturer can commit the Joint Venture to. This lack of limitation is unusual and creates a significant risk for both parties, potentially leading to one Joint Venturer obligating the Joint Venture without the other's knowledge or consent.",

        "section": "All income and credits, and all losses and deductions shall be owned and shared among the Joint Venturers as follows: 50% to Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. 50% to Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. Depreciation and all other charges and expenses, which are not expressly apportioned by this Agreement, shall be apportioned in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.",
        "explanation": "The provision regarding depreciation and other charges being apportioned according to GAAP is somewhat vague. While GAAP provides guidelines, it can also allow for some discretion in how certain items are treated. The clause 'consistently applied' is helpful, but it doesn't eliminate the potential for disagreement on the proper accounting treatment of specific items, especially in complex situations. This could lead to disputes over the true profitability of the Joint Venture.",

        "explanation": "The text states 24/7 availability 'with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance'. While understandable, 'reasonable' is ambiguous. There is no defined limit to the duration or frequency of 'reasonable' maintenance. This ambiguity could lead to disputes if the customer believes the maintenance is excessive, while i-on considers it reasonable. The lack of clarity makes it difficult to objectively determine if i-on is fulfilling its obligation to 'maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously.'",

Specifying \u201cor higher\u201d is not sufficient because there can be incompatibility issues with newer software.

        "explanation": "This section mandates that Provider Representatives be exclusively dedicated to Recipient, which is a very specific and potentially limiting condition. However, section 1.1(a) states that Provider agrees to respond in good faith to any reasonable request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient. It is possible that, to fulfill such requests, the Provider might need to utilize the same Provider Representatives. If those Provider Representatives are entirely dedicated to Recipient, fulfilling those requests may not be possible. This creates a contradiction because it would not be possible for the provider to fulfill the new requests from the Recipient.",

        "explanation": "Section 3.1 states that the agreement will terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2. This means that the agreement is valid until December 31, 2020. However, Section 2.2(c) states that Provider shall allow the Recipient to use a service at no cost, until December 31, 2021. Since the agreement expires on December 31, 2020, there is a contradiction as to how the Recipient can use the service until December 31, 2021 when the agreement will have expired.",

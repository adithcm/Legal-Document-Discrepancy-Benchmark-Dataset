        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence of Section 8.1 contradicts the initial requirement for mutual written agreement for renewal. It states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the expiration date, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates an inconsistency because it removes the need for a mutual agreement, essentially forcing renewal unless active steps are taken to prevent it. This is an inconsistency in text because it directly contradicts the provision that renewals require a 'mutual written agreement'.",

Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an ambiguity in text. The first part of the section excuses a party from performance (other than payment) due to a force majeure event, provided prompt notice is given. However, the third sentence states that a force majeure event does not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification) with respect to third-party claims. This creates an ambiguity: If a party's ability to perform its obligations, which could include actions leading to a third-party claim, is prevented by a force majeure event, is it still fully liable for indemnification related to that claim? The section doesn't clearly define the relationship between excused performance and indemnification obligations, creating potential for dispute.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "Section 8.2(b) allows for immediate termination for breach \u201cas provided in Sections 2.2, 2.4, or 12.4.\u201d However, these sections don't uniformly provide for termination for 'breach'. Section 2.2 allows either party to terminate if they can't agree on a statement of work within 2 months. Section 2.4 allows termination related to restrictions on communication. Section 12.4 allows termination if a force majeure event interferes with the agreement for 60 days or more. The first two conditions are related to disagreement while the last is related to outside interference. These aren't necessarily breaches of the agreement, but rather conditions that allow for termination. This represents a misalignment in text.",

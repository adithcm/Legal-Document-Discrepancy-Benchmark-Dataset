        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity because it states that Domini will pay the salaries of the Trust's Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini's affairs. However, it doesn't explicitly define what constitutes 'devoting time to the affairs of Domini.' This lack of clarity could lead to disputes about which salaries Domini is responsible for, especially if the same individuals also work on Trust matters. It's unclear if any time spent at all working for Domini would qualify, or if there needs to be a certain threshold or proportion of time spent.",

        "explanation": "This section lists numerous operating expenses that the Trust is responsible for. However, the phrase \"including but not limited to\" creates ambiguity. While providing examples is helpful, the open-ended nature of this clause could lead to disagreements about whether a particular expense is truly an 'operating expense' and therefore the Trust's responsibility. There is no clear criteria or definition provided within the agreement to definitively categorize expenses not specifically listed.",

The section fails to specify any method of calculation, reference to an exhibit detailing the fee structure, or any procedure for agreeing upon the fee.

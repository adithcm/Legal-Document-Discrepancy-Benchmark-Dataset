        "explanation": "The contract states that the company will use its best efforts to deliver the website in the specified timeframe, but then provides a specific start and end date indicating a fixed timeframe. This creates a contradiction, because 'best efforts' implies flexibility, while providing specific dates suggests a rigid deadline. If 'best efforts' is used, no specific dates should be listed.",

        "explanation": "The statement lacks clarity regarding how delays caused by the client will affect the overall project timeline and deadlines. The statement does not specify the consequences of the delay or how much the delay will affect the project's end date. This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the original timeline.",

        "explanation": "This section grants the Company broad rights to use Client's positive feedback and website elements for marketing purposes but lacks explicit limitations regarding how or where the feedback and design elements will be used.

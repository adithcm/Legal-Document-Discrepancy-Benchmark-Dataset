For the avoidance of doubt, 'Accuray Regions' shall only refer to North America.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Accuray Regions\" initially includes multiple regions but then specifically states that it shall only refer to North America. This creates a direct contradiction and ambiguity as to which regions are actually included in the definition throughout the document.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). ...However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",
        "explanation": "Section 4.6.1 states two different warranty terms which contradict each other. The first one notes that the warranty is only good for the period of one year following installion of products. The second one notes that Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product. This means that there are two different terms that contradict each other.",

To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. ",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory because it notes that failure to approve or disapprove a purchase order in two weeks constitutes disapproval, but then it continues by stating that each purchase order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This is a contradiction because the first part notes disapproval and the second part requires acceptance by an authorized representative.",

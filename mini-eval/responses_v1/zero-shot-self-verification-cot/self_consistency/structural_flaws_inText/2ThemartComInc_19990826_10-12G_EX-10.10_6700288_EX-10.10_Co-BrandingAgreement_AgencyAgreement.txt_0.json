        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "This section gives i-Escrow the sole discretion to determine and revise the advertising fees, potentially to the detriment of 2TheMart. It states that i-Escrow can adjust the rate \"as it sees fit without needing consent\". This creates an imbalance in the agreement, as 2TheMart is obligated to promote the services but has no control over the compensation they receive, which can be changed unilaterally by i-Escrow. It is not in good faith.",

        "explanation": "This is a blatant contradiction. The first part of the sentence states that each party shall hold the other's confidential information in confidence. The second half of the sentence completely negates this by stating that either party may disclose the other's confidential information to any third party at any time. This renders the entire section on Confidential Information meaningless.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated.",
        "explanation": "The text is structurally flawed. The last sentence in this section states, \"In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated.\" Since only one party needs to give such notice for the agreement to be renewed, it is contradictory that if either party does not give notice, the agreement will be terminated, instead of specifying it is the renewing party that must provide the notice.",

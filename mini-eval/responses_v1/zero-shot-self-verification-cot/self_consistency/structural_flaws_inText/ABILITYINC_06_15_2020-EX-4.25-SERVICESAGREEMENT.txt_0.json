        "section": "3.2 Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause. However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency. It states that either party can terminate the agreement at any time without cause, but then immediately adds a requirement of providing at least 90 days' prior written notice. The phrase \"at any time\" implies immediate termination, which contradicts the 90-day notice period. This creates ambiguity about the actual conditions required for termination. While a termination fee is mentioned, the lack of a definitive statement of when either party can cancel the agreement presents an issue.",

For such time as any employees of Provider are providing the Services to Recipient under this Agreement, (a) such employees will remain employees of Provider unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, and may under certain circumstances, be deemed employees of Recipient for specific purposes as determined by Recipient, and (b) while Provider generally remains responsible for the payment of wages, Recipient may, at its discretion, contribute to or assume responsibility for certain wages, bonuses, commissions, or employee benefits, with terms to be negotiated separately for each individual case. The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the employment status and tax responsibilities. While stating that the employees 'remain employees of Provider', it introduces exceptions where the employees could be deemed employees of Recipient 'for specific purposes as determined by Recipient'. This, coupled with the potential shift of responsibility for wages and benefits, makes the true employer and the tax implications unclear. The statement 'The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis' makes the legal statement too vague, leading to multiple interpretations and potential legal action.",

Communications are deemed given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested); (c) communications via facsimile or email are only considered valid if the recipient confirms receipt within 72 hours, otherwise they are deemed not received. (d) Notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.",
        "explanation": "This section has conflicting statements regarding when notices sent via mail are deemed received. The main statement is 'All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing'. However, the statement also indicates they 'may sometimes be given orally if agreed upon' which completely goes against the first opening sentence. The statement also says '(d) Notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.' This conflicts with the general legal standard where receipt is usually confirmed either by signature or tracking. This contradiction creates uncertainty and potential disputes over whether a notice was effectively delivered.",

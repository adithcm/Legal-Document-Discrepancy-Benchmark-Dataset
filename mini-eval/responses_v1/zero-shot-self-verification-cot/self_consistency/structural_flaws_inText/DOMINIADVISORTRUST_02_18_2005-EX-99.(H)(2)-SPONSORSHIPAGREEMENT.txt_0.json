Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an internal contradiction. First, it limits Domini's responsibility for a subcontractor's actions to the extent of the subcontractor's insurance coverage. Then, it states Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services, which creates two different limits of liability.",

The prior sentence states the agreement can be terminated at any time, without penalty, yet this sentence imposes a penalty if the Sponsor terminates within the first year.

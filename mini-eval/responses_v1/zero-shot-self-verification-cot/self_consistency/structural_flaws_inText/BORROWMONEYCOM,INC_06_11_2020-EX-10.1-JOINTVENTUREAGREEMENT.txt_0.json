        "explanation": "The section first defines the purpose of the joint venture, but then it gives BorrowMoney.com, inc. the sole discretion to change the purpose at any time. This contradicts the initial agreement that the venture's purpose is mutual. It effectively allows one member to unilaterally alter the fundamental nature of the joint venture, creating an imbalance of power and potential conflict.",

        "explanation": "The section outlines the capital contributions of each member, assigning a value of $3,500,000.00 USD to both BorrowMoney.com, inc. and JVLS, LLC. However, BorrowMoney.com, inc.'s contribution is described as 1,500 square feet of leased office space, while JVLS, LLC's contribution is $60,000.00 USD from contracts plus 10% of gross revenue. This is a contradiction because the descriptions of the contributions do not align with the equal valuation assigned to them. Leasing office space and receiving a percentage of awarded goverment contracts cannot be properly valued the same.",

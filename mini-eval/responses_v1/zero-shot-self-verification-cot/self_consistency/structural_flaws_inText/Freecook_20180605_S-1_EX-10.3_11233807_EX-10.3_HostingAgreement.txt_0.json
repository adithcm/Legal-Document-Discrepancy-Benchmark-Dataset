Delays will not affect the due dates.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory because it states that the company guarantees due dates regardless of whether the client provides necessary materials on time. This is illogical. It is impossible for the Company to guarantee the due dates if the Client does not hold up their end of the deal and give the company the documentation to complete the job. It is also not structured properly because there is no way that the company can guarantee these due dates.",

        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding when the final payment of $3,100 is due. The first sentence indicates the remaining amount is due *on* completion of the Scope of Work. The second sentence then states that the Client can pay the remaining amount at any time *before* the Scope of Work completion. These two sentences contradict each other regarding the deadline for final payment, as it is unclear as to when exactly the amount must be paid.",

The first sentence says that the Company is obligated to provide Customer Service throughout the agreement and cannot alter or cease providing it.

        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This clause attempts to impose a standard of liability on the Sponsor (Domini) that is unusually strict and potentially violates public policy. It states that the Sponsor is fully liable for *any* error of judgment or mistake of law, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. This contradicts the typical standard of care expected of investment advisors and managers, which generally requires a showing of negligence, gross negligence, or intentional misconduct for liability to attach. Under most legal frameworks, individuals or entities providing professional services are not held liable for simple errors in judgment if they acted in good faith and with reasonable care. The clause as written could deter qualified firms from serving as sponsors, as it makes them insurers of investment outcomes regardless of fault. This is a legal contradiction because it attempts to circumvent established legal principles regarding fiduciary duties and liability standards, potentially making it unenforceable.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a conflict of interest due to the removal of needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted. A prudent and reasonable trustee would only want the best individuals working with the trust, and if they are not able to have any authority in this section, this causes a large structural flaw, which does not make any sense. The second portion of the text reads that Domini will not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence. By Domini not being fully responsible for the actions of the subcontractor, Domini can essentially hire unqualified subcontractors without being held accountable for it, which opens up the trust to liability.",

        "section": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, with the payment of a penalty equal to one year of the average management fees collected over the prior three years, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.",
        "explanation": "The clause regarding termination is not well-structured. Specifically, the penalty for termination (one year of average management fees) applies equally to both the Trust and the Sponsor. While it's understandable for the Sponsor to seek compensation for early termination by the Trust, imposing the same penalty on the Sponsor for terminating the agreement is unusual and potentially inequitable. If the Sponsor terminates due to circumstances beyond its control (e.g., regulatory changes, internal restructuring making the agreement unsustainable), it seems unfair to penalize them with a year's worth of fees. This lack of nuanced consideration regarding termination triggers creates structural issues and demonstrates a structural flaw in the legal terms.",

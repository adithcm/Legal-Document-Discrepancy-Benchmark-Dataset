(a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the Provider's obligations. While the Provider agrees to provide services outlined in Exhibit A, it also states that the Provider is not obligated to respond to requests for additional services not already in Exhibit A, unless the Provider deems it \"fit and feasible\". The terms 'fit and feasible' are not defined, leading to uncertainty about what criteria the Provider uses to determine whether to provide additional services. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes about whether the Provider is obligated to provide certain services.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a structural flaw. The first sentence does not make grammatical sense. It reads, \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.\" The word \"Agreement\" appearing after \"Effective Date\" seems misplaced and disrupts the sentence's intended meaning. The sentence's start should read, \"This Agreement shall be deemed...\"",

        "explanation": "This section states that Section 2.2 survives termination. Section 2.2 pertains to \"Terms of Payment and Related Matters.\" While it's logical that payment terms for services already rendered should survive termination, the inclusion of the entirety of Section 2.2 creates ambiguity. Section 2.2(c) states: \"Provider shall allow the Recipient to use [ * * * ] at no cost, until December 31, 2021.\" If the agreement is terminated *before* December 31, 2021, it's unclear whether the Recipient's right to use [ * * * ] at no cost continues until the original date or is also terminated.",

        "section": "Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay.",
        "explanation": "This statement is contradictory because it's nearly impossible for project deadlines to be completely inflexible and not subject to any delay. Unforeseen circumstances (illness, server outages, unexpected technical difficulties, etc.) can inevitably cause delays. Saying that due dates are *never* subject to delay is an unreasonable and potentially unenforceable clause. It's an overreach that doesn't account for real-world contingencies, therefore, this is an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "Company representatives are available during Company's normal business hours which are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. UTC +2, Monday through Friday. UTC +2 does not specify a location which makes the legal statement ambiguous. A legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations.",

        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Distributor\" is ambiguous. It includes Siemens, its Affiliates, *or* any Third Party granted distribution rights by Siemens. This creates uncertainty regarding the responsibilities and liabilities of each type of Distributor. For instance, are Siemens' Affiliates held to the same standards as a completely unrelated Third Party granted distributorship? The level of control and responsibility Siemens has over its Affiliates is significantly different from that of a Third Party, potentially leading to disputes over contract performance or liability.",

        "section": "3.6. Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency regarding the parties to the Service Agreement. It states that the Service Agreement can be between Accuray and the Customer *or* Accuray and the Distributor, as determined by Section 4.8. However, Section 4.8 primarily discusses *how* Accuray will execute a Service Agreement (upon receipt of a copy executed by the Customer and payments) and also speaks to a scenario where the Distributor might enter the service agreement with the customer. It doesn't explicitly define the circumstances under which the service agreement is between Accuray and customer or Accuray and distributor. This creates ambiguity as to who is ultimately responsible for the service if the Service Agreement is between Accuray and Distributor. It makes the obligations unclear.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradictory scenario concerning expedited shipping costs. It states that if the delivery deadline in the Purchase Order is at least six months after submission, Accuray bears the expedited delivery costs. However, it also provides examples where Accuray bears the cost if the Purchase Order was submitted on June 1st and the delivery date is December 1st (6 months later), while the Distributor bears the cost if the delivery date is October 1st (4 months). The contradiction exists in the fact that the rule states 'at least six months', and then gives an example of exactly six months, which isn't 'at least'. This causes ambiguity.",

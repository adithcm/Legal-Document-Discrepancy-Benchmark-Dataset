        "section": "14. INDEMNITY\nCONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency. Initially, it states that the CONSULTANT is responsible for indemnifying ADAMS GOLF for all expenses, excluding attorney's fees. However, the subsequent sentence states that ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000. This creates an ambiguity regarding the allocation of responsibility for attorney's fees in cases where ADAMS GOLF seeks indemnity from the CONSULTANT. It's unclear whether the CONSULTANT is always responsible for ADAMS GOLF's attorney's fees, or if there's a cap of $10,000 on ADAMS GOLF's coverage of CONSULTANT's fees.",

        "section": "8. MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION\nA. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1.  Year 1. $[*****]\n2.  Year 2 $[*****]\n3.  Year 3 $[*****]\n4.  Year 4 $[*****]\n5.  Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "The section lacks clarity and consistency regarding the minimum number of tournaments. It states the consultant must achieve a 'satisfactory record of play' in a minimum number of events, but this minimum number is redacted. It also indicates repayment is due for each event *under* a certain number of events achieved, but that number is also redacted. Without knowing these numbers, it's impossible to determine the consultant's obligations or the consequences of not meeting them, leading to ambiguity.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the financial consequences of termination due to the consultant's inability to play, including death. However, the method of repayment is based on Section 8A, which concerns the minimum number of tournaments played and a *pro rata* repayment schedule if the consultant fails to meet the yearly minimum number of tournaments. Applying this repayment scheme to a situation where the consultant dies or is permanently disabled and unable to play makes very little sense. This is a structural flaw because Section 8A does not consider this situation and only considers if the minimum number of games was not attended, not death or permanent inability to play.",

        "explanation": "This section promises 24/7 operation but then allows for maintenance. While maintenance is a reasonable exception, the clause 'i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends' is not a guarantee. There's no penalty if they don't schedule it during those times. Thus the definition of 'reasonable' is not explicit or constrained, creating uncertainty as to what constitutes acceptable downtime. The lack of defined parameters for maintenance windows, such as frequency, duration, or notification requirements, also weakens the promise of continuous operation.",

        "explanation": "The use of a shared T1 line introduces potential performance issues. The language 'reasonable efforts to maintain such connectivity' is also vague. There are no guarantees about bandwidth, uptime, or latency. If the shared T1 line becomes saturated, the Customer's website performance could suffer, and i-on's only obligation is to make 'reasonable efforts', which is subjective and unenforceable without defined metrics. This is a misaligned of legal terms, as 'reasonable efforts' doesn't imply any specific level of service or performance.",

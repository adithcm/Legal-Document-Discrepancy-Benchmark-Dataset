        "section": "i-on will schedule and perform such maintenance at its convenience, without prior notice.",
        "explanation": "This statement lacks specificity. While i-on retains control, the lack of a notice period, a definition of 'necessary', or a limitation on frequency or duration introduces ambiguity.  'Convenience' is subjective and could be interpreted broadly, potentially conflicting with the implied obligation to provide continuous service. This could lead to disputes if maintenance is frequent or lengthy, negatively impacting the Customer's hosted site accessibility. There should be a statement of reasonable amount of time.",

        "explanation": "There's an inconsistency in how non-payment is addressed. Initially, it suggests 'interruption or discontinuation' MAY occur. However, the following text states that i-on 'will have the right to disable the Hosted Site.' This changes the consequence from a possibility to a definite right, creating ambiguity.

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The termination clause creates a contradiction. It states that the agreement automatically renews for one-month periods unless 15 days' notice is given.  However, it *also* states that either party can terminate 'at any time' with 30 days' notice 'without cause'. If the agreement is in the middle of one of its one-month auto-renewals, can it *really* be terminated 'at any time', or is termination limited to occurring *at the end* of an auto-renewal period, which requires 15 days notice to avoid the automatic renewal? This creates uncertainty about how the 30-day termination clause interacts with the auto-renewal.",

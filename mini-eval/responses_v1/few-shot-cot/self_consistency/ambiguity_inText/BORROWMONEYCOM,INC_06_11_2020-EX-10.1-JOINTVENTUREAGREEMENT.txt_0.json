        "explanation": "The managers of the joint venture are appointed to manage and dictate policy. The initial sentence states the managers will jointly decide all issues, whereas the second sentence states that a majority vote of the managers will be required if an agreement cannot be met. This means that technically one manager could overrule the other manager causing a disagreement when it comes to deciding major issues.",

        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. In the first sentence, the members are not liable for the venture when made in good faith. The second sentence means that the members will be liable for any and all acts or failures to act resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means there is no good faith.",

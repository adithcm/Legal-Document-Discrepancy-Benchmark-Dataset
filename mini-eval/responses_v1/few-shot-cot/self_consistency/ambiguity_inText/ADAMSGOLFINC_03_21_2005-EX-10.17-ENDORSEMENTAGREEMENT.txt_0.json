        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image solely in print advertising campaigns for ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. This excludes any personal appearances or television commercials.",
        "explanation": "This section defines \"Endorsement\" very narrowly, specifically excluding personal appearances and television commercials. However, Section 11, \"Promotional Appearances,\" requires the CONSULTANT to be available for television and radio commercials and states that in interviews and appearances, the CONSULTANT will make reference to ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT. This directly contradicts the definition of \"Endorsement\" as it includes activities (TV/radio appearances) that the definition explicitly excludes. The agreement inconsistently defines the scope of endorsement, creating confusion over the consultant's obligations and Adams Golf's rights.",

The decision on whether to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT in a specific tournament will be at the sole discretion of the CONSULTANT based on performance considerations. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section states the consultant must exclusively use 'mandatory products' whenever practical and that the decision on the product is at the consultant's sole discretion. The section also states the consultant may use clubs other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including a putter. This is contradictory because while the consultant has discretion to use ADAMS GOLF products, the section states the use of those product are mandatory. Also, the consultant may play a club or putter that is not an Adams Golf product so long as the consultant may not endorse the product. The section does not adequately describe the consultants responsibilities regarding a non Adams Golf product.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This clause presents an internal inconsistency. It first states that the Consultant indemnifies Adams Golf from all liabilities and expenses *excluding* attorney's fees and expenses. Then, it contradicts itself by stating that Adams Golf will cover the Consultant's attorney's fees, but only up to $10,000. This creates confusion about which party is ultimately responsible for legal fees in indemnity claims related to Consultant's breach. If the Consultant breaches, are they responsible for Adams Golf's legal costs? What happens if the Consultant's legal costs exceed $10,000? The clause is unclear on the extent of liability and responsibility for legal fees.",

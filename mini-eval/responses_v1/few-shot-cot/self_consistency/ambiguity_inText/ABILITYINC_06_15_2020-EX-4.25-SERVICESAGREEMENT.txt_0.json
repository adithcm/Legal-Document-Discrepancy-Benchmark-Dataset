        "section": "Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states the Provider agrees to provide services in Exhibit A. The second sentence then introduces a contradiction by stating the Provider is NOT obligated to respond to requests for additional services not in the Exhibit, even if 'necessary for the operation of the Recipient,' unless the Provider deems it 'fit and feasible.' This creates uncertainty. If the Exhibit is supposed to define the scope of services, the caveat that Provider can refuse necessary services contradicts the initial agreement to provide services based on the Exhibit.",

        "explanation": "The original paragraph specifies the Provider shall maintain records relating to the services. However, the added sentence gives the Provider complete discretion over the format of those records. This could allow Provider to keep records in a way that is insufficient for Recipient's needs or auditing, negating the practical value of the requirement to maintain records in the first place. Because Provider maintains the records, the language allows for manipulation of the format so Recipient cannot view them if the Provider wishes to hide something.",

        "explanation": "This grants all rights, title, and interest in inventions made by the Provider to the Recipient, but only 'if both parties agree it is related to the services.' This introduces a subjective element that could lead to disputes. If Provider creates an invention arguably related to the services but Recipient doesn't agree, ownership is ambiguous. The subjective 'agreement' undermines the clear ownership provision.",

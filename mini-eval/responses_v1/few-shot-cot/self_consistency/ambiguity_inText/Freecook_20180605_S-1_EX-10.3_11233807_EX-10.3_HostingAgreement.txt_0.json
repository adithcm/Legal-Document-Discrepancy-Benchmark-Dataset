Delays can be caused by many reasons, and it is unreasonable to assert that there will be no delays, therefore, the document becomes internally inconsistent.",

The first sentence suggests that Customer Service will be provided, as specified in this section, yet the very next sentence contradicts that by stating that the Company can alter or cease providing Customer Service.

        "section": "1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions specifically for CyberKnife products and services (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, excluding Australia, India, and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Accuray Regions\" lists specific geographical areas but excludes Australia, India and Japan from APAC, while including India in EIMEA. This is structurally flawed because Japan is listed as both its own region and excluded from APAC. This dual definition is contradictory and unclear.",

Distributor shall be and must at all times make it clear that it is an independent entity contracting with Accuray, and is not the employee, representative or agent of Accuray, except when explicitly authorized by Accuray in writing. Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner, unless such authority is expressly delegated to the Distributor by Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The clause that states, 'except when explicitly authorized by Accuray in writing' contradicts the assertion that the distributor 'is not the employee, representative or agent of Accuray'. If the distributor can be explicitly authorized to act on Accuray's behalf, it implies a form of agency, undermining the claim of complete independence and creates ambiguity about the scope of the distributor's authority.",

Accuray will endeavor to provide to Distributor or Customer, as applicable, in a timely manner those Products and Services required to fill confirmed Purchase Orders received from Distributor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The text states that Accuray will *endeavor* to provide Products and Services which introduces ambiguity regarding Accuray's obligation to fulfill Purchase Orders. The word 'endeavor' implies an effort, but does not guarantee fulfillment. This weakens the enforceability of the clause, creating uncertainty and giving Accuray leeway to potentially not fulfill orders, contradicting the expected commitment to fulfilling accepted Purchase Orders.",

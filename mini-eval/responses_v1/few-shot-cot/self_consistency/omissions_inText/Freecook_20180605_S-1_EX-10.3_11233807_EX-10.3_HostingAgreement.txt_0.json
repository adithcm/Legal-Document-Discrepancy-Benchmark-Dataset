        "section": "1. Website Design and Development. Client agrees to pay to Company to design and develop a website for Client (the \"Client Website\") in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. (a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work. (b) Due Dates and Delays. Company will use its best efforts to deliver the Client Website in the time frame specified in the Scope of Work. Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",
        "explanation": "Section 1(b) outlines that the project duration is 12 weeks, specifically from February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018. However, it also states that the due dates are subject to delay if the Company doesn't receive the required materials from the client on time, or if approvals are delayed by the client, or if the scope of work is changed by the client. This introduces an ambiguity: while there's a defined timeline, the numerous conditions for potential delays significantly undermine the certainty of that timeline. A discrepancy arises because the agreement doesn't clearly define what constitutes a 'timely manner' or how these delays impact the overall project deadline. This could lead to disputes about whether the project was completed 'on time' as the term is ambiguously defined, potentially affecting payment obligations.",

        "section": "2. Payment Terms. Upon the signing of this Agreement, Client agrees to pay to Company a total of $5,000. Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 on completion of the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "While section 2 specifies that the remaining balance of $3,100 is due upon 'completion of the Scope of Work,' this term 'completion of the Scope of Work' is not clearly defined in the contract. It is not explicitly stated who determines whether the scope of work is complete, or what constitutes 'completion.' This lack of clarity is a discrepancy. The agreement could be interpreted in multiple ways: does completion mean the website is functional and live, or simply that the agreed-upon features are implemented, regardless of their functionality or client satisfaction? This ambiguity can lead to disagreements and disputes regarding when the final payment is triggered, and who has the authority to determine completion.",

        "section": "3. Business Hours; Rush Work. Company representatives are available during Company's normal business hours which are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. UTC +2, Monday through Friday. Any email or telephone correspondence received after normal business hours will be processed the following business day. Client shall pay an additional surcharge for any services requiring work to be performed outside of normal business hours by reason of a rush deadline requested by Client or as a result of Client's failure to meet scheduled times for delivery and/or review and approval of information, content and materials. The surcharge for rush work shall be the hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%).",
        "explanation": "Section 3 establishes the company's business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m. UTC +2, Monday to Friday) and outlines a surcharge for 'rush work,' which is work required outside normal business hours due to client-related reasons. The discrepancy is the absence of a defined 'hourly rate' within the contract. The clause states that the surcharge is 'the hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%)' but never defines or specifies what that hourly rate is. This omission is a critical ambiguity. Without a clearly defined hourly rate, calculating and charging for rush work becomes arbitrary and subjective, leaving the client vulnerable to potentially inflated or unreasonable charges. This undefined term is a significant oversight and a potential source of dispute.",

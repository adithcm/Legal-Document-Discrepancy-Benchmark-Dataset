        "explanation": "The phrase 'Exhibit A attached hereto, describes by way of example but not limitation the responsibilities of the Joint Venturers' is structurally flawed and doesn't make grammatical sense in the context of Section 2. It seems like an incomplete sentence or a fragment that doesn't properly integrate with the preceding subsection (e). This creates a textual flaw making the responsibilities of the Joint Venture to be confusing.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This sentence is ambiguous. It is not clear what 'as needed' means. It is not clear whether the joint venturers will be the one that determine the amount to be contributed. In addition, it is not clear if both Joint Ventures are supposed to contribute or only one of them. The ambiguity creates uncertainty about the financial obligations of each Joint Venturer.",

        "section": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall continue indefinitely.",
        "explanation": "The statement that the Joint Venture 'shall continue indefinitely' is contradictory. Without a defined termination point or mechanism, it creates uncertainty about the intended lifespan of the Joint Venture. This is because if the agreement does not specify how to terminate the agreement, it will lead to the contract never expiring. Since the agreement does not give a definitive ending date, it does not specify how to disburse any profits gained in the agreement.",

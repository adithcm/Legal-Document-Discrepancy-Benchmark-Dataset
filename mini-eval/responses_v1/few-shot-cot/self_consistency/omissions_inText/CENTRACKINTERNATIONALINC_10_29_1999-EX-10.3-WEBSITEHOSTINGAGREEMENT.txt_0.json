        "section": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends.",
        "explanation": "The service agreement guarantees 24/7 operation, but allows for 'reasonable' maintenance. The term 'reasonable' is subjective and not clearly defined. This introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes reasonable downtime for maintenance. There is no specific limit on maintenance downtime, creating uncertainty. The lack of a quantifiable limit on 'reasonable' maintenance allows for potential abuse, such as frequent or extended maintenance periods that effectively disrupt the 24/7 service guarantee. The contract doesn't define how the customer will be notified about the maintenance in advance nor what is the maximum alloted time for a maintenance.",

        "section": "The Customer acknowledges that the Internet is an unreliable, unsecured, and error-prone network and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any interruptions in service to the Hosted Site or inability for users to reach or effectively use the Hosted Site that arises outside the scope of i-on's responsibilities as explicitly described in this Agreement. The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",
        "explanation": "This clause contains a contradiction. I-on offers mirrored storage and backups as a service, implicitly warranting data protection. Holding i-on harmless for data loss undermines this implicit guarantee. It creates uncertainty about the actual reliability of I-on's services and what actions I-on is required to take to prevent data loss before being held harmless. The phrase 'reasonable steps' is vague, allowing i-on to potentially avoid liability even in cases of negligence. The definition of the 'reasonable steps' is ambiguous.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement for the Hosted Site shall commence upon April 1, 1999 and shall continue for a period of six (6) months, unless earlier terminated in accordance with provisions hereof. This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due to i-on and to make such payments on a timely basis.",
        "explanation": "This section details both automatic renewal for one-month periods and termination with 30 days' notice. However, if the customer terminates the agreement, there is an obligation for the customer to pay all amounts due. The agreement implies that the customer may still need to pay for the months after termination, creating a contradiction. If the customer terminates at the end of the month, they will still need to pay the costs. The termination and costs due are contradictory.",

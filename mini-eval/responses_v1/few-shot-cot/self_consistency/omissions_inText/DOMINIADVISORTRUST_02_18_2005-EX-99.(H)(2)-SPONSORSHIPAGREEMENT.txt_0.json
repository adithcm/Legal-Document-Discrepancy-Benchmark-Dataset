        "section": "1. Duties of the Sponsor. Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative, and management services. However, the following sentence says 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed...any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets'. This creates an ambiguity because in the first sentence the agreement suggests that they will perform management services. However, the latter sentence suggests that they will not be deemed responsible for management services. One could argue that oversight is a management service.",

Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section allocates expenses between Domini and the Trust. However, the phrase 'including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this agreement' is vague. It states that the Trust will pay its operating expenses, including the fees due to the sponsor. The amount is not specified. The fee is mentioned but it is not clear what this fee will be, nor how the fee is calculated, which makes this ambiguous.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 3, regarding compensation, states that the Trust shall pay Domini a 'mutually agreed upon fee'. This term 'mutually agreed upon fee' is too vague. It doesn't establish any baseline or minimum for the fee. It does not even state how to begin agreeing upon the fee. This term is ambiguous because there is no set amount and the fee is only determined if the parties agree.",

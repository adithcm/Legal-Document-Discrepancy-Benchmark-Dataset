        "section": "NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants set forth below, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: <*$p$*>1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement. The following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning: 1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date). 1.2. \"Customer\" means any person or business entity with whom Distributor enters into an agreement for Products or Services pursuant to this Agreement. 1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates. 1.4. \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" means a purchase. 1.5. \"Multi-Modality Purchase\" means the purchase, on a single purchase order, of at least one Distributor imaging product. 1.6. \"Multiple LINAC Purchase\" means the purchase, on a single purchase order, of at least one Distributor linear accelerator product. 1.7. \"Product(s)\" means related products manufactured by or for Accuray for use in the radiosurgery market. 1.8. \"Quote\" means a quote provided by Accuray to Distributor pursuant to Section 2.3 that will serve as the basis for the Product configuration. 1.9. \"Service(s)\" means the performance of services by Accuray or its distributors. 1.10. \"Service Agreements\" means the Accuray CyberKnife Service Agreement. 1.11. \"Spare Parts\" means replacement or additional parts or Products. 1.12. \"Specification(s)\" means the current written description of a Product or Service. 1.13. \"System(s)\" means the Accuray CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase' as simply 'a purchase' is circular and unhelpful. It fails to provide any meaningful distinction or clarification, rendering the subsequent definitions of 'Multi-Modality Purchase' and 'Multiple LINAC Purchase', which rely on this definition, less clear. This lack of clarity undermines the contract's overall purpose of defining specific purchasing arrangements.",

        "section": "4.5. Import License. Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer. <*$p$*>4.6. Warranty. 4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray. \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable. In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor",
        "explanation": "This creates an ambiguity by stating that Accuray or its distributor will obtain import licenses, but then introduces a condition where the Distributor might have to enter a separate agreement to handle import licenses. This lacks clarity about which entity is ultimately responsible for import licenses in specific situations and depends on the consent of the distributor to enter into a seperate agreement. This creates potential delays and confusion regarding regulatory compliance.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray. \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable. In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. 4.6.2. Hardware and Software. If a Customer notifies Accuray in writing of a defect in a Product that causes the Product to fail to conform to the foregoing warranty, Accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non- conforming Product. This will be Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and such Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective Products and parts.<*$p$*> 4.6.3. Software and Bug Fixes. Notwithstanding Section 4.6.2, for a period of 10 years following Installation of a System, Accuray will provide to Customer, without charge, Bug Fixes with respect to any software included in the System. This is Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective software. By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Bug Fixes available to Customer, and Accuray shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or implementation of such Bug Fixes at the Customer's site. \"Bug Fix\" means an error correction or minor change in the existing software and/or hardware configuration that is required in order to enable the existing software and/or hardware configuration to perform to the existing functional specification(s).",
        "explanation": "While Accuray provides a warranty, the warranty is not applicable if the product is used by the Distributor, Customer or their respective agents before installation. This is a potential contradiction, because it states that if they use the product before installation, which is not allowed, they will not be covered by any warranty.",

Distributor acknowledges the validity and proprietary value of Accuray's trademarks including, but not limited to, \"CyberKnife.\" Accuray shall retain sole ownership of all goodwill associated with the Products, as represented and symbolized by the associated trademarks, and Distributor shall not register any of Accuray's trademarks in its name. Distributor undertakes to display Accuray's trademarks solely in connection with identifying Accuray in the sale and marketing of Products hereunder. Distributor shall not remove copyright notices or any trademarks from the Products. Distributor shall not be entitled to use said trademarks in conjunction with Distributor's own trademarks or for any other purpose, except in the manner authorized by Accuray, which authorization will not be unreasonably withheld and in compliance with distribution standards and specifications established by Accuray. If Accuray determines in its sole discretion that Distributor is not meeting such standards and specifications, Distributor shall immediately, at Accuray's instructions, take all steps necessary to ensure that such standards and specifications are met or cease all further use and display of the trademarks. In the event of expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor shall immediately discontinue all use of Accuray's trademarks except for the sale of Distributor's inventory of Products. <*$p$*>10. INDEMNITIES. 10.1. Accuray Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'except for the sale of Distributor's inventory of Products' in Section 9.5 is vague. Does this mean the Distributor can continue to use Accuray's trademarks indefinitely to sell off existing inventory, even years after termination? Or is there an implied reasonable timeframe? This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the permitted use of trademarks post-termination.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Accuray will have no obligation under Sections 10.1 (Accuray Indemnity) or 10.2 (Products Liability Indemnity) for any third-party claim to the extent that such claim results from: (i) use of any Products not in accordance with Accuray's written Specifications; (ii) use or combination of the Products with other items, such as other equipment, processes, programming applications or materials not furnished by Accuray; (iii) compliance by Accuray with Distributor's or Customers' designs, specifications or instructions; (iv) modifications to a Product not made by or at the express written direction of Accuray; (v) Distributor's failure to use updated or modified Products provided by Accuray, provided that such updated or modified Products would have avoided the basis for such claim; or (vi) Distributor's use or distribution of a Product other than in accordance with this Agreement. The foregoing clauses (i) to (vi) are referred to collectively as \"Indemnity Exclusions\".",
        "explanation": "By giving Accuray sole control over the defense and settlement of any claim, distributor has to relinquish the ability to choose legal representation which could be against the distributor's best interest. In a products liability claim, the distributor has little say and is therefore not a balanced agreement.",

The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
        "explanation": "The provision states that employees of the Provider will remain employees of the Provider unless otherwise agreed in writing, but then also allows for the possibility that these employees may be deemed employees of the Recipient for specific purposes as determined by the Recipient. This creates a contradiction as it is unclear under what 'specific purposes' the Recipient can deem Provider's employees as their own. Furthermore, the statement that 'responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis' introduces ambiguity. Tax law usually clearly defines employer responsibilities, so this case-by-case determination could contradict legal requirements and cause confusion or non-compliance.",

        "explanation": "The text has ambiguity in legal terms, because the tax is on a case by case basis. Tax obligations cannot be determined on a case by case basis, as tax law dictates what these obligations are, and who they are placed on. A case by case basis is a contradiction to the federal laws of tax",

        "explanation": "This clause defines the term of the agreement, setting a fixed termination date of December 31, 2020, 'unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.' The subsequent Section 3.2 then grants both parties the right to terminate 'at any time without cause' by providing 90 days' prior written notice. This creates a clear contradiction: the agreement has a fixed end date, but can also be terminated at any time before then at either party's discretion. This makes the actual duration uncertain.",

To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "This termination clause states, 'Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause', but follows this by stating that a termination is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ] and 90 days written notice. The phrase 'at any time without cause' implies an immediate and unconditional right to terminate, while the subsequent requirements of a notice period and termination fee contradict this by imposing conditions. The meaning of 'at any time without cause' is significantly restricted, creating an inconsistency.",

        "explanation": "In section (c), it mentions that communications via email are only considered valid if the recipient confirms receipt within 72 hours, otherwise they are deemed not received. Section (d) says that notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch. If the communication is valid if confirmation is given for emails, it creates a misalignment because it should also be in place for mail, because confirmation is more reliable and secure.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "This clause gives i-Escrow complete and unfettered discretion to determine and revise the advertising fees paid to 2TheMart. The statement that the 'per Transaction Inquiry amount [is] calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion' coupled with 'i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent' creates a situation where i-Escrow could effectively set the fee to a negligible amount. This undermines the intent of an advertising fee arrangement and lacks mutuality, which creates the possibility of a contradiction, which could be interpreted as i-Escrow being able to advertise at will for free.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence states that 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated.' This creates a logical contradiction with the earlier statement that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement'. If both parties fail to give notice, the agreement would terminate. However, it's logically inconsistent because mutual written agreement is necessary for renewal according to the contract.",

A party's \"Confidential Information\" is defined as any information, regardless of whether it is marked confidential or identified as such, that one party provides to the other. Each party shall hold the other party's Confidential Information in confidence, except that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time. Such restrictions shall not apply to Confidential Information which (a) is already known by the recipient, (b) becomes, through no act or fault of the recipient, publicly known, (c) is received by recipient from a third party without a restriction on disclosure or use, or (d) is independently developed by recipient without reference to the Confidential Information. The restriction on disclosure shall not apply to Confidential Information which is required to be disclosed by a court or government agency. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, within fourteen (14) days of the other party's request, each party will return all Confidential Information and other deliverables to the requesting party.",
        "explanation": "This section defines Confidential Information and initially states that 'Each party shall hold the other party's Confidential Information in confidence'. However, it then immediately contradicts this by stating 'except that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time.' This subsequent clause negates the initial confidentiality obligation, creating a direct contradiction. The effect of these statements is ambiguous, as both statements oppose each other, which introduces confusion about whether the party is legally required to keep confidentiality.",

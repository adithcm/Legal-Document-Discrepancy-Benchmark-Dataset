        "explanation": "This clause creates an inconsistency. It states that the due dates are guaranteed by the Company regardless of delays caused by the client. It is contradictory to guarantee a due date regardless of the actions/inactions of the client since the client has a big part in the ability for the company to get to the deadline.",

        "explanation": "This clause presents a direct contradiction. The first sentence states that the Company is obligated to provide Customer Service and cannot alter or cease providing it. The subsequent sentence immediately contradicts this by saying the Company may, at its sole discretion, alter or cease providing Customer Service without any liability.

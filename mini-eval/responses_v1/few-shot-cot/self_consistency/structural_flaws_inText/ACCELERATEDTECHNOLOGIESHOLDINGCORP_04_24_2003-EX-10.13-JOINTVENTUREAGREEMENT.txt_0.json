        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as determined necessary by either Joint Venturer, regardless of mutual consent.",
        "explanation": "The original text states that each joint venturer can request capital contributions unilaterally, 'regardless of mutual consent', which means that there is no need for approval or agreement of both venturers. This means that one joint venturer can force capital contributions without the other's agreement, which contradicts the later statement that the joint venturers shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture. If capital contributions can be forced unilaterally then the other party does not have charge of all affairs.",

        "section": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until terminated by either party with a thirty (30) day notice, regardless of the original termination date. This termination clause supersedes any prior agreement regarding the venture's term.",
        "explanation": "The original text stipulates that either party can terminate the Joint Venture with a thirty day notice to the other party. However, the wording 'This termination clause supersedes any prior agreement regarding the venture's term' is ambiguous and contradictory because it doesn't state how long the Joint Venture is to last for if no termination occurs. This contradicts the need for a defined term that is required for legal documentation and agreement.",

However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
        "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the ability to withdraw funds. It allows a joint venturer to unilaterally withdraw funds at any time without consent, and limits this right to 10% of the venturer's capital contribution, however it states 'All other distributions will adhere to the original terms'. This could imply that the original terms dictate that no distributions can occur without consent, or that distributions are determined based on Section 6. This then contradicts the initial statement, as there are multiple interpretations on the term 'All other distributions'.",

        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the allocation of charges and expenses between Domini and the Trust. It states that Domini pays the salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini's affairs. Then, it states that the Trust pays its operating expenses, 'including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement'. This language could be interpreted as contradictory. If the fees paid to the Sponsor are considered operating expenses of the trust (as implied by 'including but not limited to'), yet some of the services provided by the Sponsor involve paying the salaries of the Trust's personnel, this creates an indirect double-payment scenario. The Sponsor is effectively being reimbursed for salaries that the Trust arguably covers through the sponsor fees.  This creates ambiguity regarding the true net expense borne by the Trust.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding termination penalties. The first sentence states that the agreement may be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty'. However, the very next sentence then states 'termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee'. This is a direct contradiction, making it unclear if a termination penalty applies and under what specific circumstances.",

As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit the liability of the Sponsor. While it excludes liability for errors in judgment or mistakes of law, it includes an exception for 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder'. The phrase 'reckless disregard' is vague and creates ambiguity.  While willful misfeasance, bad faith, and gross negligence are generally understood legal concepts, 'reckless disregard' is less precise. It is unclear what standard a court would apply to determine if the Sponsor acted with 'reckless disregard' and whether this overlaps with 'gross negligence'. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the interpretation of the liability limitation and its enforceability under Massachusetts law, which governs the agreement (Section 10).",

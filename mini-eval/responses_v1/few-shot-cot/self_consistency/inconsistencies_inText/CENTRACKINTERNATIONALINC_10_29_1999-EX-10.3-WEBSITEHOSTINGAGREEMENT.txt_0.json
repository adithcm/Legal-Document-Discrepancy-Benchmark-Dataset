        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the payment terms. The first sentence states that the customer must pay $450, and the second sentence says that payment is due by the 20th of each month. The effective date for payments, according to this section, is April 1, 1999, yet the contract's effective date is April 6, 1999. Because the contract was written April 6, 1999, it is impossible for a payment date of April 1, 1999 to be valid.",

        "explanation": "The initial statement guarantees continuous operation except for reasonable maintenance. However, the subsequent statement grants i-on the freedom to schedule maintenance at any time of day, including weekdays. This creates an ambiguity: Is continuous operation truly guaranteed if maintenance can disrupt service during peak usage times? This lacks specificity and the contract should define when maintenance can occur.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section creates contradictory terms for contract termination and renewal. The automatic renewal clause, requiring a 5-day notice before the end of the term to prevent renewal, conflicts with the clause allowing either party to terminate the agreement 'without cause' with a 30-day written notice. If someone terminates with a 30-day written notice, the renewal clause is pointless. Since the 30-day written notice allows for more flexibility, and trumps the 5-day written notice, this contradicts what the meaning of '5-days before' is.",

        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.",
        "explanation": "Section 2 outlines the allocation of expenses between Domini and the Trust. It states Domini covers salaries of trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini or its affiliates. It also states that Domini covers legal counsel fees. However, it excludes 'compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor' from Domini's coverage. This is inconsistent because, previously, all trustee compensation was specified as Dominis' responsibility.",

        "explanation": "This section allows termination of the agreement by either party (the Trust or the Sponsor) with 60 days' notice and a $10,000 penalty. However, termination penalties may face legal challenge depending on the jurisdiction if the penalty is deemed excessive or punitive rather than a reasonable estimate of damages. This means there could be an ambiguity because a judge may decide whether or not the penalty is valid in court.",

        "section": "Domini is not responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor.",
        "explanation": "This clause, found in Section 7 (Subcontracting by Domini), could be problematic. Under general legal principles, a party is typically responsible for the actions of its subcontractors, especially if the subcontracted work is integral to the performance of the main contract. This blanket statement of non-responsibility could contradict legal standards regarding vicarious liability and create legal challenges if a subcontractor's actions cause harm or breach the agreement. The validity of this section could depend on whether it's considered an enforceable waiver of liability under applicable law and whether it violates public policy.",

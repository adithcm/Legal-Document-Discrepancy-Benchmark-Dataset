        "section": "For such time as any employees of Provider are providing the Services to Recipient under this Agreement, (a) such employees will remain employees of Provider unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, and may under certain circumstances, be deemed employees of Recipient for specific purposes as determined by Recipient, and (b) while Provider generally remains responsible for the payment of wages, Recipient may, at its discretion, contribute to or assume responsibility for certain wages, bonuses, commissions, or employee benefits, with terms to be negotiated separately for each individual case. The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
        "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding employee status and wage responsibility. While stating employees remain with the Provider, it also allows the Recipient to deem them employees and contribute to/assume wage responsibility, creating ambiguity about who is the legal employer and who handles tax withholdings.",

However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "Section 3.1 states the agreement terminates on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier per Section 3.2. However, Section 3.2 allows either party to terminate 'at any time' with 90 days notice, creating an ambiguity. If a party gives notice *after* December 31, 2020, does that notice have any effect, given the agreement's supposed termination on that date?",

In the text it states that mail is considered received 'upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt'. If the letter is lost in the mail, but the sender can prove that they sent it, then it is considered delivered, making this inconsistent.",

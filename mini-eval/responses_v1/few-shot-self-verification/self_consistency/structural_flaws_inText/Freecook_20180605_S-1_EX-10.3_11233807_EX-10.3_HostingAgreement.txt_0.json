        "explanation": "This section states that the due dates are guaranteed by the Company regardless of whether the company receives required materials from the client on time. This is an inconsistency because it is not possible for the company to deliver its project in time if the client does not give them the materials on time. This clause is contradictory because it holds the company responsible for delays caused by the client.",

        "explanation": "This section contains contradicting terms. It first mentions that 'Company is obligated to continue providing Customer Service throughout the duration of this agreement, and may not alter or cease providing Customer Service'. This contradicts the next sentance where it mentions that 'Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service'. Both clauses contradict each other.

For the avoidance of doubt, 'Accuray Regions' shall only refer to North America.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Accuray Regions' initially encompasses several global regions, but the subsequent sentence restricts it to only North America. This creates a clear contradiction and ambiguity because other parts of the agreement might rely on the broader, original definition, leading to confusion about the geographic scope of the agreement.",

Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Accuray retains the right to appoint additional exclusive distributors within specific geographic territories, even if those territories overlap with the Distributor's existing customer base. By way of clarification, this Agreement does not relate to any Cayman Product, including, without limitation, the distribution or sale thereof or any services related thereto.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence grants the Distributor a *non-exclusive, worldwide* distribution right. The second sentence allows Accuray to appoint *exclusive* distributors, even in areas overlapping with the current Distributor's territory. This creates a direct conflict: the Distributor's *non-exclusive, worldwide* right is undermined by Accuray's ability to grant *exclusive* rights in the same areas.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.",
        "explanation": "There is a direct conflict as Accuray first provides a 1 year warranty to customers but then warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",

Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer.",
        "explanation": "The text introduces uncertainty regarding which party is responsible for obtaining import licenses and being the importer of record. It initially states that Accuray or its distributor will handle this, then adds a condition where the Distributor might be required to do so, depending on Accuray's presence and subject to the Distributor's consent. This creates ambiguity about the default arrangement and the conditions under which it changes.",

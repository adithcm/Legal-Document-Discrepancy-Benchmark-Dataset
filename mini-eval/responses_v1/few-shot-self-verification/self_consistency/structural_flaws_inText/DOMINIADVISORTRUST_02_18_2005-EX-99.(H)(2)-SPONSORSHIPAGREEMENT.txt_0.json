        "section": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party. However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The text introduces a contradiction regarding termination penalties. The first sentence states that termination can occur 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty'. However, the second sentence then states that 'termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.' This creates ambiguity regarding termination penalties.",

Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses subcontracting, limiting Domini's liability for subcontractors' actions to the extent of their insurance coverage and excluding liability for actions outside the contracted services. However, the limitation of liability might not be permissible under applicable law if Domini fails to properly oversee the subcontractor's actions, especially if those actions cause harm to the Trust.

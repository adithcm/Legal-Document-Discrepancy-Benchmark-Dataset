        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as determined necessary by either Joint Venturer, regardless of mutual consent.",
        "explanation": "The requirement for capital contributions as 'determined necessary by either Joint Venturer, regardless of mutual consent' directly contradicts the earlier stated principle of both Joint Venturers having full and complete charge of all affairs. Requiring capital contributions without mutual consent undermines the authority balance.",

        "section": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until terminated by either party with a thirty (30) day notice, regardless of the original termination date. This termination clause supersedes any prior agreement regarding the venture's term.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'regardless of the original termination date' creates ambiguity. Since there isn't a defined original termination date mentioned earlier in the agreement, this clause is confusing.",

However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
        "explanation": "This clause creates a contradiction. It starts by stating a Joint Venturer may unilaterally withdraw funds or property, but then limits the withdrawal to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. This creates ambiguity regarding the ability to withdraw.",

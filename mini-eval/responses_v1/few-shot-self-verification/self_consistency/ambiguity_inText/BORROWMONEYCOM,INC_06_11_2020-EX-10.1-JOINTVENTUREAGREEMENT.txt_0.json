        "explanation": "The agreement states that the execution date is \"this 20th day of Friday, March 2020\". However, March 20, 2020 was a Friday. This is a structural flaw as it states the day of the week.",

        "explanation": "The valuation of BorrowMoney.com, Inc.'s contribution (1,500 sq ft of leased office space) at $3,500,000.00 USD seems exceptionally high and is not properly justified. Such a valuation requires a clear method of calculation, such as appraisal, to be considered reasonable. This ambiguity leads to questions about the fairness and accuracy of the capital contributions.",

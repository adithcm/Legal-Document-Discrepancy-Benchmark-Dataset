        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image solely in print advertising campaigns for ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. This excludes any personal appearances or television commercials.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.A limits the endorsement to print advertising, while section 3 grants Adams Golf the exclusive right to use the endorsement in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of the product. The term advertising as used in Section 3 is not limited to print, thus creating an ambiguity as it may be construed that Adams Golf has the right to use Tom Watson's endorsement for advertising beyond the print advertising restriction that is laid out in section 2.A.",

The decision on whether to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT in a specific tournament will be at the sole discretion of the CONSULTANT based on performance considerations. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "The first sentence requires Watson to exclusively use the mandatory product, but the second sentence allows him to decide based on performance considerations. The third sentence states that Watson may play other clubs that are not ADAMS GOLF clubs, This presents a contradiction as the document requires the consultant to play exclusively with ADAMS GOLF products when practical but also states that the consultant may play with other club brands.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section includes an in-text contradiction. It states that the consultant is responsible for indemnifying ADAMS GOLF for all expenses, excluding attorney's fees, but then it adds a clause where ADAMS GOLF will cover consultant's attorney fees up to $10,000. It goes back and forth about who is responsible for attorney's fees, thus creating an ambiguity.",

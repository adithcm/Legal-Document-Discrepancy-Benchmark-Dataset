However, later in the agreement, under 'Responsibilities of the Customer,' the Customer is responsible for all content and its ongoing maintenance.  If i-on performs unannounced maintenance, it could disrupt the Customer's ability to maintain their content, creating a conflict of obligations and an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The agreement states that payments are due within 30 days of invoice receipt. However, the actual process of interruption or discontinuation is undefined, and therefore could occur at any time, including prior to the end of the 30 day period, or without warning. This introduces ambiguitiy.",

        "explanation": "The agreement initially states a 6-month term but then introduces automatic monthly renewals unless a 15-day notice is given. This is an in-text contradiction because it's unclear if the agreement is truly for 6 months or indefinitely renewable monthly, changing the core obligation regarding the duration of the service.",

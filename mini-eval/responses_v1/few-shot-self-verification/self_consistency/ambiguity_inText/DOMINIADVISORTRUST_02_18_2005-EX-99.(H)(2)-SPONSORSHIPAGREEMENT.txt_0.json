        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section contradicts standard legal principles regarding liability. It attempts to impose liability on the Sponsor even for errors of judgment or mistakes of law *without* requiring any element of fault, such as negligence or bad faith. This is an extremely high standard and would likely be unenforceable as written, as it essentially makes the Sponsor an insurer against any loss, regardless of how it occurred, as an error in judgement is very broad.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence' is unclear. It isn't clear if there is a limited coverage for acts and ommissions of the subcontractor, as Domini isn't held fully responsible. The section needs to fully state whether Domini should or shouldn't be held fully responsible.",

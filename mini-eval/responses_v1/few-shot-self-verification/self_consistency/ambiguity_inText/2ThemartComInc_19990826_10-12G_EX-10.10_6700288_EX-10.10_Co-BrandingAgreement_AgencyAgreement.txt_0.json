        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous because it requires them to complete at least one transaction *per month*. However, the Agreement doesn't specify which month this refers to. Does it mean one transaction in every calendar month, or one transaction within a 30-day period from their first access? This ambiguity can lead to disputes.",

A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The text is structurally flawed due to repetitive sentences. 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.' is repeated twice. This repetition does not make sense in the structural form of the text, leading to confusion.",

        "explanation": "The notice clause is contradictory in its requirements for effective notice. It states that notice is only deemed given upon personal delivery, acknowledged fax, or three days after mailing by overnight courier. This is contradictory as it provides different methods of delivery for a notice to be deemed valid. The lack of clarity on which method is superior creates ambiguity.",

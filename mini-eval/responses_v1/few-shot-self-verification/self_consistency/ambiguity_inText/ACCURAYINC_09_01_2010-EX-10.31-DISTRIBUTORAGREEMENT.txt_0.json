        "explanation": "The definition of \"Accuray Regions\" creates ambiguity because it defines APAC as \"Asia Pacific, excluding Australia, India, and Japan\". It is unclear if the defined term is correct or if this was a mistake.",

Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner, unless such authority is expressly delegated to the Distributor by Accuray.",

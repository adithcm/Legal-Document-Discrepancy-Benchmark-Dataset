        "section": "NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants set forth below, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: <*$p$*>1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement. The following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning: 1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date). 1.2. \"Customer\" means any person or business entity with whom Distributor enters into an agreement for Products or Services pursuant to this Agreement. 1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates. 1.4. \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" means a purchase. 1.5. \"Multi-Modality Purchase\" means the purchase, on a single purchase order, of at least one Distributor imaging product. 1.6. \"Multiple LINAC Purchase\" means the purchase, on a single purchase order, of at least one Distributor linear accelerator product. 1.7. \"Product(s)\" means related products manufactured by or for Accuray for use in the radiosurgery market. 1.8. \"Quote\" means a quote provided by Accuray to Distributor pursuant to Section 2.3 that will serve as the basis for the Product configuration. 1.9. \"Service(s)\" means the performance of services by Accuray or its distributors. 1.10. \"Service Agreements\" means the Accuray CyberKnife Service Agreement. 1.11. \"Spare Parts\" means replacement or additional parts or Products. 1.12. \"Specification(s)\" means the current written description of a Product or Service. 1.13. \"System(s)\" means the Accuray CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" as simply \"a purchase\" is overly broad and renders the subsequent definitions of \"Multi-Modality Purchase\" and \"Multiple LINAC Purchase\" redundant and confusing. This creates ambiguity as the term \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" is used throughout the agreement to define the scope of the distributorship, making it unclear whether any purchase of Accuray products falls under this agreement or only those specifically meeting the criteria of sections 1.5 and 1.6.",

        "section": "4.5. Import License. Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer. <*$p$*>4.6. Warranty. 4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray. \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable. In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.",
        "explanation": "In section 4.5, Accuray specifies that import licenses will be maintained. However, this switches when there is no 'direct presence' from Accuray in a particular country. This shifts the burden onto the Distributor with the added condition of an extra distribution agreement being written. This transfer of responsbility needs to be more clear and needs to state who has the last say.",

        "section": "9.5. Trademarks. Distributor acknowledges the validity and proprietary value of Accuray's trademarks including, but not limited to, \"CyberKnife.\" Accuray shall retain sole ownership of all goodwill associated with the Products, as represented and symbolized by the associated trademarks, and Distributor shall not register any of Accuray's trademarks in its name. Distributor undertakes to display Accuray's trademarks solely in connection with identifying Accuray in the sale and marketing of Products hereunder. Distributor shall not remove copyright notices or any trademarks from the Products. Distributor shall not be entitled to use said trademarks in conjunction with Distributor's own trademarks or for any other purpose, except in the manner authorized by Accuray, which authorization will not be unreasonably withheld and in compliance with distribution standards and specifications established by Accuray. If Accuray determines in its sole discretion that Distributor is not meeting such standards and specifications, Distributor shall immediately, at Accuray's instructions, take all steps necessary to ensure that such standards and specifications are met or cease all further use and display of the trademarks. In the event of expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor shall immediately discontinue all use of Accuray's trademarks except for the sale of Distributor's inventory of Products. <*$p$*>10. INDEMNITIES. 10.1. Accuray Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "The section states that \"Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.\" while this may be normal, this should have a clear explanation in terms of when a Distributor can do this.",

        "section": "10.3. Injunctions. If Distributor's rights to use and distribute a Product under the terms of this Agreement are, or in Accuray's opinion are likely to be, enjoined due to the type of claim specified in Section 10.1 (Accuray Indemnity), then Accuray may, at its sole option and expense: (i) procure for Distributor the right to continue to use and distribute such Product under the terms of this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify such Product so that it is non- 17 infringing.<*$p$*> 10.4. Indemnity Exclusions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Accuray will have no obligation under Sections 10.1 (Accuray Indemnity) or 10.2 (Products Liability Indemnity) for any third-party claim to the extent that such claim results from: (i) use of any Products not in accordance with Accuray's written Specifications; (ii) use or combination of the Products with other items, such as other equipment, processes, programming applications or materials not furnished by Accuray; (iii) compliance by Accuray with Distributor's or Customers' designs, specifications or instructions; (iv) modifications to a Product not made by or at the express written direction of Accuray; (v) Distributor's failure to use updated or modified Products provided by Accuray, provided that such updated or modified Products would have avoided the basis for such claim; or (vi) Distributor's use or distribution of a Product other than in accordance with this Agreement. The foregoing clauses (i) to (vi) are referred to collectively as \"Indemnity Exclusions\".",
        "explanation": "This portion of the text creates a potential contradiction. It states that if an injunction occurs, Accuray has the option to 'procure for Distributor the right to continue to use and distribute such Product under the terms of this Agreement' or 'replace or modify such Product so that it is non- infringing'. While these are generally acceptable actions, the text 'at its sole option and expense' could become a point of contention as it is the Distributor who would feel the effect of an injunction. Therefore the Distributor has the right to request Accuray to fulfill an option.",

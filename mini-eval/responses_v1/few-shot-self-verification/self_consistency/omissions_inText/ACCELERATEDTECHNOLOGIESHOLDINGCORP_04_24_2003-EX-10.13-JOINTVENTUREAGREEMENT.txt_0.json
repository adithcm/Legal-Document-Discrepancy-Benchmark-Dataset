        "explanation": "This is a structural flaw as the sentance does not make sense. It starts out with a task: 'Develop a global marketing program for licensed Products' but then proceeds to say 'Exhibit A attached hereto, describes by way of example but not limitation the responsibilities of the Joint Venturers'.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity regarding the capital contributions. By adding 'as needed', the parties responsibilities are not defined, leading to potential financial obligations on the joint venturers that can be construed in many different ways.",

        "explanation": "The term 'indefinitely' is ambiguous. Contracts should specify a fixed term or a renewal mechanism. Continuing 'indefinitely' makes it unclear how or when the joint venture can be terminated, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

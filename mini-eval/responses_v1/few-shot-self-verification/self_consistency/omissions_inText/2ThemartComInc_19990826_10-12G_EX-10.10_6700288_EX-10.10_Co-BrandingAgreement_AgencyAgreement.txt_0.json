        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The term 'Adjusted Rate' is not clearly defined. While it's mentioned that the formula may be revised, there is no initial formula defined to begin with. Furthermore, the term says it 'may be revised from time to time', introducing uncertainty. How is the rate initially determined? What market conditions dictate change?",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This section establishes conflicting standards. It first states that California Escrow Law prevails in case of conflict, but then introduces a provision for the parties to 'use their best efforts to resolve such conflict', implying that the Escrow Law might not automatically supersede the agreement. This creates ambiguity about whether i-Escrow is definitively bound by California Escrow Law or whether the agreement can override it.",

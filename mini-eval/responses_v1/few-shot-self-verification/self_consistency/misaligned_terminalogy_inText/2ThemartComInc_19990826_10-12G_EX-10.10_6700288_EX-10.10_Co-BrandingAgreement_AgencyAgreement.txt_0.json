This includes, but is not limited to, text, audio files, visual recordings, images, datasets, or programs. Assets given by 2TheMart will be known as \"2TheMart Material,\" while assets given by i-Escrow are termed \"i-Escrow Media.\"",
        "explanation": "The definition of CONTENT is broad and encompassing, but the later use of \"2TheMart Material\" and \"i-Escrow Media\" in the indemnity clause (Section 9) narrows the scope of responsibility. This misalignment could lead to disputes if content outside these defined terms causes liabilities.",

This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The section states that 'This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties'. However, it does not define what 'periodically' means, which can be once every year or once every week. This is an ambiguity that can be exploited in court.",

Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The initial broad indemnity is limited by 'provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor,' which is vague and undefined. The later clauses specifying indemnity for '2TheMart Material' and 'i-Escrow Media' seem to operate independently, creating confusion about when the 'key agent' condition applies and leading to multiple interpretations. It also uses the term 'Deliverables provided to Patrons' which is undefined.",

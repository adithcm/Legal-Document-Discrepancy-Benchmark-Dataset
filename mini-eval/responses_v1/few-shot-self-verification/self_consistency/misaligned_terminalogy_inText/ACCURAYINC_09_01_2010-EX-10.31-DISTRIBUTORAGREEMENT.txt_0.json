        "explanation": "The initial definition states 'Distributor' means Siemens, but the subsequent sentence introduces a broader definition of 'Partner' that includes Siemens, its Affiliates, OR any third party with distribution rights granted by Siemens. This creates a misalignment because the document now uses both 'Distributor' and 'Partner', potentially interchangeably, without explicitly defining when each term applies, thus leading to confusion of obligations.",

        "explanation": "The original text in Section 4.1.1 states that Accuray will supply 'Retailer or Customer, as applicable' but there is not mention of 'Retailer' anywhere else in the document. This creates a contradiction because the text uses the wrong term in this part of the section.",

        "explanation": "The statement emphasizes the Distributor's independence from Accuray. However, the later statement 'Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner.' is too broad, creating confusion if a written statement from Accuray existed. This contradiction occurs because this clause fails to account for situations where Accuray has authorized the Distributor to act on its behalf, like in Section 2.3.4. ('unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor')",

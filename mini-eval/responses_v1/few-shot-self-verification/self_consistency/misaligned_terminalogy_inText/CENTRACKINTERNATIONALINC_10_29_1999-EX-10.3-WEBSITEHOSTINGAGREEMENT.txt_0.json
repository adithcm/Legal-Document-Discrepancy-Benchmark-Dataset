It states that the agreement will automatically be renewed for one month periods unless notice is given 15 days before end of current period, but also mentions either party can terminate the agreement without cause with a 30-day notice. The 15-day notice for non-renewal is contradicted by the 30-day notice for termination, as the termination clause would allow for termination even if the 15-day non-renewal notice wasn't given.",

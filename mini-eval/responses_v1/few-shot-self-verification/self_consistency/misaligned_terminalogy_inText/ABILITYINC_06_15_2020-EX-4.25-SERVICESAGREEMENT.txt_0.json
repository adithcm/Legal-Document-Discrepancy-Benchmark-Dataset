Recipient wishes to engage the Vendor to provide certain services and resources (the \"Deliverables\") and Provider desires to provide Recipient with the Services all in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.",
        "explanation": "The Recitals section creates confusion by using 'Vendor' and 'Provider' to refer to the same entity without clearly defining the interchangeable use. The agreement defines the parties at the beginning as provider and recipient, but then references Vendor in the Recitals without an explicit definition. This creates a misalignment of terminology that could lead to misinterpretations of responsibilities and obligations.",

        "explanation": "The agreement states the 20th day of Friday, March 2020. March 20, 2020 was actually a Friday, meaning that this is not a structural flaw. However, if the agreement says the wrong date in conjunction with the wrong day, then there is a structural flaw because the statement does not make sense.",

A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture.

The value of the Venture is to be determined based on the total revenue generated over the last 3 months.

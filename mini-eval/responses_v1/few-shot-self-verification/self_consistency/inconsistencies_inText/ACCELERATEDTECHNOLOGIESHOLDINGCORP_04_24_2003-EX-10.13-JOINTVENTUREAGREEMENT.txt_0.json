        "section": "8. Term of Joint Venture. The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination. However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction in the term of the joint venture. The first sentence states that it ends on February 28, 2004, unless extended by written agreement. However, the second sentence allows either party to unilaterally terminate the agreement with 60 days written notice, implying the agreement could end sooner. This creates uncertainty about the actual term of the venture.",

        "section": "9. Distributions. During the term of the Joint Venture, no interest shall be allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. No Joint Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided, however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "A contradiction exists between the general rule for distributions and the specific entitlement of PVSS. The main text states that distributions are to be made from gross income not needed for expenses, only when assets exceed liabilities, and ratably according to ownership. However, the 'Notwithstanding the foregoing' clause grants PVSS a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, irrespective of profitability or the availability of funds. This prioritizes PVSS's payment over the general distribution rules.",

        "section": "11. Procedure on Termination and Liquidation. On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This clause contains a contradiction regarding asset valuation during liquidation. Initially, it states that if assets can't be divided, the parties will agree on a price. However, the final sentence grants Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. the final say on the asset's value in case of a dispute. This undermines the initial requirement for mutual agreement and gives CCGI unilateral control over valuation.",

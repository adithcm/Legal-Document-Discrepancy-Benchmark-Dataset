        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that Domini will pay the salaries of trustees, officers, and agents who devote their time to Domini's affairs. It also states that the Trust will pay all its operating expenses except for specific fees due to the Sponsor, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.  However, the text goes on to say that Dominin will cover legal counsel fees which seems to be a direct contradiction to the language above it.",

        "explanation": "The Sponsor can terminate the agreement with 60 days' notice. There is no mention of any penalties or other financial punishments to the Sponsor for terminating the agreement. However, for the Trust, the text mentions the Trust must pay the Sponsor $10,000 if the Trust decides to terminate the agreement. This creates some uncertainty on whether a penalty should be charged to the Sponsor if it decides to terminate the agreement. Thus, creating an in-text contradiction.",

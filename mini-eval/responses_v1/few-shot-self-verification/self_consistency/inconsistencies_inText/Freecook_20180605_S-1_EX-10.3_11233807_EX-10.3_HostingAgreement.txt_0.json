        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the project timeline. It first states that the terms of the project are for 12 weeks (February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018), but then guarantees completion within 8 weeks, implying a different, shorter timeframe. This creates confusion and uncertainty about the actual guaranteed completion time and when delay penalties would apply.",

        "section": "Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines Provider's agreement to provide services as detailed in Exhibit A. However, it also includes a clause that Provider is not obligated to provide additional services or resources necessary for the Recipient's operation if they are not already in the Exhibit. The discrepancy lies in the potential contradiction between agreeing to provide 'Services' per Exhibit A, and then stating a non-obligation to provide 'additional services and resources' that might be necessary for the Recipient's operation but not explicitly listed. This is because Exhibit A defines what 'Services' actually includes, so it could be argued that what the Recipient deems 'necessary for operation' falls under those Services. This creates an ambiguity about Provider's true obligation and what is covered under 'Services' based on Exhibit A's precise definition. It becomes uncertain if Provider's discretion overrides needs explicitly necessary for operation.",

        "explanation": "While Provider is obligated to maintain records of their services, the agreement allows the Provider to determine the format solely. In legal documents, the agreement requires the format of the records to be more specific. This is due to the fact that if there are any disputes or something happens that is not agreed upon, it is up to the recipient to figure out how the format of the record is and what it means, since the provider can determine this. Therefore, there should be rules about how this format should be. This is considered as a discrepancy.",

        "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding ownership of inventions. Initially, Recipient owns all rights to inventions made by Provider. However, the change adds 'if both parties agree it is related to the services,' making ownership contingent on mutual agreement. This creates a contradiction: the earlier part grants full ownership, but the amendment makes it conditional. This could lead to disputes if the Provider creates an invention related to the services but disagrees about its relation, causing uncertainty on ownership rights and making it harder to enforce Recipient's claim to such inventions.",

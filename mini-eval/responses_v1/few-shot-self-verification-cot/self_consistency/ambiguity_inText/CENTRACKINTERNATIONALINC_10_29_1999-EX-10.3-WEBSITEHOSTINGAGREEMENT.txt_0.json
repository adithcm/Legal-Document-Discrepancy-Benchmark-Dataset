        "section": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of necessary hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will schedule and perform such maintenance at its convenience, without prior notice.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity in text. The first sentence promises continuous operation 'twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays'. The second sentence then introduces an exception for 'necessary hardware and software maintenance' which i-on will perform 'at its convenience, without prior notice'. This creates ambiguity. It does not define 'necessary', 'hardware and software maintenance', or limit the frequency or duration of such maintenance. This lack of clarity allows i-on to potentially interrupt service for extended periods under the guise of maintenance, undermining the initial promise of continuous operation.",

The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees within 30 days of receiving the invoice. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner may result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "This section is inconsistent and creates an in-text contradiction. It first states the customer is responsible for paying the fee. The following sentence states that the customer is responsible for paying within 30 days of receiving the invoice. The term 'in a timely manner' in the third sentence is not defined. This does not give the customer a date to pay within.",

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",
        "explanation": "This is an omission in a legal term. The document contains a disclaimer stating the i-on is not responsible for harm from the reliability of the internet. The document requires a customer to agree to be held harmless, however, a disclaimer releasing a company from liability may be unenforceable if it violates public policy or state law. Many states set a degree of liability that a company can be held for. This omission makes the contract non-compliant.",

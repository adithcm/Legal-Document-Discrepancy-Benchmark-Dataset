        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to define the Sponsor's liability. However, it contradicts well-established legal principles regarding negligence and fiduciary duty. Generally, a party is *not* liable for errors in judgment or mistakes of law *unless* those errors stem from negligence, bad faith, or reckless disregard of duty. This provision purports to impose strict liability (liability without fault) on the Sponsor, which is highly unusual and likely unenforceable, especially given the nature of the services being provided (oversight, administrative, management) which involve judgment calls. This effectively eliminates any reasonable standard of care and exposes the Sponsor to liability for nearly any loss, regardless of the circumstances. It contradicts the reasonable person standard applied in negligence cases.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This section contains two significant contradictions and potentially violates fiduciary duties: First, it allows Domini to subcontract without needing the Trustees' approval of the subcontractor's qualifications. This undermines the Trustees' oversight responsibility and their ability to ensure competent service providers. They have no ability to reject a subcontractor. Second, it states that Domini is only responsible for the subcontractor's gross negligence. This is problematic because Domini *should* be responsible for the *reasonable* actions of their subcontractors. Subcontracting is Domini's choice, and they cannot completely shield themselves from liability for a subcontractor's negligence, especially given Domini's oversight role and the sensitive nature of the services. The level of negligence is too high to be considered valid.",

        "explanation": "This termination clause is problematic. It allows the Sponsor to terminate with a penalty payment. This is not necessarily illegal, but can be contradictory. Because of the services being rendered and the fiduciary duties, the Sponsor cannot terminate the contract freely.",

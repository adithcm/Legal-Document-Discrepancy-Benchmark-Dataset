        "explanation": "This section outlines that managers must jointly decide on major issues. However, it then states that if they cannot agree, a majority vote of the *Managers* will be required. This creates an in-text contradiction because the definition of 'Managers' is that Aldo Piscitello and Jody Stewart have been appointed by the *Members*. This means that the Members appointed the Managers, but this section states that the majority of the Managers will be required, meaning Aldo Piscitello and Jody Stewart have to agree when the decision is intended to be by the Members, meaning BorrowMoney.com, inc and JVLS, LLC.",

        "explanation": "This section describes each members capital contribution. BorrowMoney.com, inc contributed 1,500 square feet of leased office space and that has an agreed value of $3,500,000.00. JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go contributed $60,000.00 USD from contracts and 10% of any gross revenue. This is also valued at $3,500,000.00. There is no evidence to suggest that JVLS, LLC would have the same amount in capital contribution as the leased office space from BorrowMoney.com, inc. In addition, 10% is ambiguous as it is not clearly stated what contract JVLS, LLC should be receiving the 10% of, so the calculation on whether it would be equal to the $3,500,000.00 cannot be determined, creating an in-text contradiction.",

It states that it would be according to the percentage of ownership as described in the 'Valuation of Interest' but no percentage of ownership has been defined.

        "section": "Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay.",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts standard legal practice and potentially creates an unenforceable term. Unforeseen circumstances (illness, natural disasters, etc.) can legitimately cause delays. A blanket statement prohibiting *any* delay, regardless of cause, is unreasonable and likely unenforceable under the legal principle of 'force majeure' or similar doctrines excusing performance due to unforeseen events.",

        "explanation": "While specifying formats is reasonable, refusing PDF format is technically illogical in the digital age. PDFs are universally readable and can contain selectable text. The statement is structurally flawed because the logic is poor; it makes no sense to refuse a standard electronic document.",

        "explanation": "This gives the Company the right to unilaterally remove an agreed-upon service without any liability. This clause is ambiguous and potentially unconscionable because it effectively negates the value of the Customer Service that the client is to receive. This can be considered a structural flaw because the agreement mentions customer service but allows the company to remove it at any time.",

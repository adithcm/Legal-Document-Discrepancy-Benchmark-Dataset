        "section": "Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied meet minimum quality standards. Accuray will endeavor to provide to Distributor or Customer, as applicable, in a timely manner those Products and Services required to fill confirmed Purchase Orders received from Distributor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The language 'Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied meet minimum quality standards' creates ambiguity because it does not specify what these 'minimum quality standards' are or how they are measured. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes about whether Accuray has fulfilled this responsibility. Further, the phrase 'Accuray will endeavor to provide' suggests that Accuray's commitment is not absolute, and they are making an effort. This weakens the enforceability of this clause, creating a contradiction to the responsibility of making sure that the products meet minimum quality standards.",

Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner, unless such authority is expressly delegated to the Distributor by Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This creates ambiguity. The first sentence states 'Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner' but the second part says 'unless such authority is expressly delegated to the Distributor by Accuray.' This implies that they can enter into binding agreements for Accuray if there is authorization, creating a contradictory statement.",

        "explanation": "The agreement identifies Natalija Tunevic as the director of FreeCook, the client. However, the signature block at the end is labeled '/s/ Natalija Tunevic Website Design, Development and Hosting Agreement' as if the agreement itself is signing the document. This suggests an inconsistency in who is actually entering into the agreement.",

        "explanation": "The agreement states the terms of the project are 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, the agreement is entered into on January 11, 2018. It is not clear why the timeframe starts a month later. If the work were to start at the time of signing of the agreement, that would mean that the delivery date would be March 29, 2018, but the delivery date is supposed to be May 3, 2018, which would add an extra month of work after the agreement signing.",

        "explanation": "While the agreement states that client will pay the remaining $3,100 upon completion of the Scope of Work, it doesn't define what constitutes 'completion.' It is not specific, and therefore can be open for interpretation. This can cause a disagreement about when the final amount is to be paid.",

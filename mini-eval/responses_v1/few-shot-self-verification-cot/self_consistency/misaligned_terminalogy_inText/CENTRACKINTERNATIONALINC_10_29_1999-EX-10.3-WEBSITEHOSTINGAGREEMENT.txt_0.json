        "section": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that i-on will maintain continuous operation of the Hosted Site, but immediately creates an exception for 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance'. The term 'reasonable' is subjective and undefined within the contract. It's unclear how much downtime is considered 'reasonable', creating ambiguity.  Furthermore, while i-on will use 'best efforts' to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours, it doesn't guarantee it. This could result in maintenance during peak usage times, contradicting the intention of continuous operation.",

The subscriber is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "This clause is inconsistent, creating ambiguity.  The first sentence states the Customer is responsible for paying. The second sentence then refers to the 'subscriber' being responsible for paying. While arguably the Customer and Subscriber are intended to be the same, the differing terminology creates an opening for dispute.  It should consistently use either 'Customer' or 'Subscriber'. Furthermore, it's unclear what 'interruption or discontinuation of services' entails. Could i-on immediately terminate the agreement, or simply suspend services temporarily? The severity of the consequence is not specified.",

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",
        "explanation": "This clause contains internal ambiguity related to the scope of i-on's liability. While it initially releases i-on from liability for interruptions outside its explicitly described responsibilities, the second sentence includes a caveat: 'provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.' The problem is that 'reasonable steps' is undefined, and it's open to interpretation whether I-on has indeed taken those steps, creating potential disputes.",

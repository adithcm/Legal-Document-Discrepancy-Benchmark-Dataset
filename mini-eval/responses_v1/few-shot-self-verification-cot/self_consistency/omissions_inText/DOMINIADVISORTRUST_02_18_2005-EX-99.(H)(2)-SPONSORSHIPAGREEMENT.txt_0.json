        "explanation": "Section 1 outlines the duties of the Sponsor as performing 'oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust.' However, it then explicitly states that the Sponsor is not responsible for the management of the Trust's *assets* or *rendering investment advice*, essentially negating a potentially significant part of the 'management services'. This creates a contradiction because, depending on the interpretation, 'management services' could reasonably be understood to include asset management or investment advice, and the exclusion creates uncertainty about the scope of the Sponsor's actual responsibilities.",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section allocates expenses between Domini and the Trust. Domini pays the salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who spend time on Domini's affairs, while the Trust pays 'all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement.' The contradiction arises because the Trustees, officers, and agents paid by Domini are likely involved in the oversight, administration, and management services for which the Trust is paying Domini a fee under Section 3. Therefore, the Trust is indirectly paying for these personnel through the Sponsor's fees, even though the section states Domini is responsible for their salaries. This constitutes a double-payment scenario and an inconsistency in the allocation of expenses. This could further cause ambiguity in legal terms, depending on state law.",

        "explanation": "The Termination clause states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust.' This contradicts Section 3, which stipulates that if Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than a whole period, the compensation is determined by 'mutual agreement.' If the Trust terminates the agreement mid-period, the Sponsor would expect to be compensated, but that may not be the case, because there is a termination clause that says this can be done without penalty. This lack of clarity on payment during termination creates financial uncertainty and could lead to legal disputes.",

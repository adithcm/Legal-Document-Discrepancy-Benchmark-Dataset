        "section": "Scope of the Joint Venture Business. The Joint Venture is formed for the purpose of engaging generally in the business of marketing batteries and related products, (the \"Products\") that include the display of licensed logos, images, brand names and other labels that differentiate them from the branding (the \"PVSS Products\") under which PVSS and/or its affiliates, sell to retailers and distributors in the normal course of their business. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, the business of the Joint Venture shall include: (a) The purchase of Products for resale; (b) The acquisition of a license(s) permitting the use of selected images in the Products; (c) The sale and distribution of the Products to retailers and distributors; and, (d) The transaction of such other and further business as is necessary, advisable, or incidental to the business of the Joint Venture. (e) Develop a global marketing program for licensed Products Exhibit A attached hereto, describes by way of example but not limitation the responsibilities of the Joint Venturers",
        "explanation": "The addition of \"(e) Develop a global marketing program for licensed Products Exhibit A attached hereto, describes by way of example but not limitation the responsibilities of the Joint Venturers\" is structurally flawed and doesn't fit grammatically within the list of the Joint Venture's business activities (a-d). It abruptly shifts from concrete actions like purchasing and licensing to a statement referencing a global marketing program and Exhibit A. This disrupts the logical flow and creates ambiguity about whether the marketing program is a separate business activity or merely a descriptor of responsibilities. Further, it suggests that the responsibilities of the parties are set out in the exhibit, but the description for the scope of the joint venture is confusing",

        "explanation": "This statement is too vague. The sentence gives no specifics on how or when the capital contributions are decided upon. It's unclear who determines the need for contributions, the amount, or the process for requesting and approving them. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes.",

        "explanation": "While the principal place of business is clearly defined, the authorization to maintain 'such other offices as the Joint Venturers may deem advisable' introduces potential ambiguity. It does not specify how such decisions are made (e.g., requiring unanimous consent or majority vote), potentially leading to disagreements on expansion or location of additional offices.",

        "explanation": "The term of the agreement is initially defined as starting March 1, 2020, and ending February 28, 2025.  However, the phrase 'or as otherwise provided in this Agreement' introduces ambiguity. If there are other clauses that could terminate or alter the term (e.g., early termination conditions, extension clauses that don't require unanimous consent), this creates an inconsistency. It is not clear exactly what the term is due to this clause, and is dependent on other sections. This is ambiguous and contradictory.",

        "explanation": "While seemingly straightforward, granting the Managers the power to define the purpose of the venture is problematic.  Without any constraint or parameters, the Managers could theoretically alter the venture's purpose in a way that fundamentally shifts its business focus, conflicting with the original intent of the Members. This is a structural issue as it could be interpretted that the Managers would have more power than the members of the Venture, which would not make sense. The original purpose of the document is to outline responsibilities and agreements. By allowing managers to define the scope of the purpose, they are undermining the reason for the document.",

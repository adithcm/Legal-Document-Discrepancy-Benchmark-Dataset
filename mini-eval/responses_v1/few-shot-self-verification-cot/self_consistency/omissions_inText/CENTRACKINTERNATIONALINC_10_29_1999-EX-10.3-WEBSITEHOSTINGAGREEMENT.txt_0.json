        "section": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that i-on will maintain the website 24/7, but makes an exception for reasonable maintenance. However, it then states that i-on will use best efforts to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours. The term 'best efforts' is ambiguous and does not provide a definitive guarantee that maintenance will *always* occur during those hours. This ambiguity creates uncertainty for the Customer, as i-on could potentially perform maintenance during peak hours if they deem it necessary, leading to service interruptions and potential disputes.",

        "explanation": "This clause provides i-on with broad discretionary power over the Customer's software installations. The term 'sole discretion' is open to interpretation and could be used arbitrarily by i-on to deny or remove programs, scripts, or components that the Customer deems essential for their website's functionality. This lack of objective criteria creates uncertainty for the Customer and could potentially lead to disputes if i-on's decisions are perceived as unfair or unreasonable.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'outside the scope of i-on's responsibilities as explicitly described in this Agreement' is ambiguous. While the agreement outlines i-on's responsibilities, the precise boundaries of these responsibilities are not always clearly defined. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes if the Customer experiences service interruptions and i-on claims that the issue falls outside their defined responsibilities, even if the Customer believes otherwise. The ambiguity makes it difficult to determine which party bears the responsibility for certain types of service failures.",

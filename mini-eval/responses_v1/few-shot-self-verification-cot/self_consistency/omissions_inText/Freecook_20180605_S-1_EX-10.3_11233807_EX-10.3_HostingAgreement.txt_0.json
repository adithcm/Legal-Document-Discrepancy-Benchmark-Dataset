        "explanation": "The agreement states that the website design and development will be in accordance with Exhibit A (Scope of Work). However, Exhibit A only describes the stages of development (search for competitors, logo development, UI/UX design, etc.) but does not define the actual design or specific features. This lack of specificity creates ambiguity, as the scope of work lacks concrete details on what the 'Client Website' will actually entail and this leads to a discrepancy in the text.",

        "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the due dates. The document states '12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018'. 12 weeks from February 8, 2018, would actually be May 3, 2018. However, calculating 12 weeks from February 8th results in May 3rd, but there is a deadline introduced within that section to mean that if something is delayed it will affect the 12 weeks time frame, but this is an inconsistently defined term. By removing this deadline, this changes the original agreement. This creates a discrepancy.",

Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.",
        "explanation": "In this section there are conflicting terms that are within the same paragraph which creates a structural flaw. The first sentence states that the company 'shall provide customer service'. In the next sentence, it states that 'Company is not obligated to provide any Customer Service except as specified in this Section'. This is conflicting because it first states that the company 'shall provide customer service' then contradicts itself and says it is 'not obligated' to provide customer service.",

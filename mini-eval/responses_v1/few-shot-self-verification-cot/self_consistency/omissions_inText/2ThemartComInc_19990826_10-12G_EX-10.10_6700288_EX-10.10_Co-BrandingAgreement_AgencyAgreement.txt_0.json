        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines a fee structure based on Transaction Inquiries, with a provision for adjusting the rate. However, it fails to explicitly define *how* the 'per Transaction Inquiry amount' is initially determined. It mentions that the *formula* may be revised, but omits the initial formula itself, leaving a crucial element undefined. This ambiguity makes it impossible to ascertain the starting point for these advertising fees, leading to potential disputes.",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This clause creates a contradiction. The initial part clearly states that California Escrow Law prevails in case of conflict. However, the subsequent sentence mandates that i-Escrow notify 2TheMart of the conflict and that 'the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.' This contradicts the preceding statement that California Escrow Law already takes precedence and creates ambiguity as to whether 2TheMart can amend this law. This contradicts with the prevailing Escrow Law and makes it unclear on how the issue will be resolved.",

        "explanation": "The section outlining notice procedures and addresses for both parties presents a potential omission that could cause practical problems. While it specifies methods for delivering notices (personal delivery, fax with confirmation, overnight courier), it **doesn't specify an email address for either party**. In contemporary business practice, email is a standard form of communication, and its omission here is unusual. This omission may result in the lack of proper and timely communication of notices between parties which is not acceptable.",

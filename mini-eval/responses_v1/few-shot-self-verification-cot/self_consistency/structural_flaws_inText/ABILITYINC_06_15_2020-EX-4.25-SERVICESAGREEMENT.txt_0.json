        "section": "For such time as any employees of Provider are providing the Services to Recipient under this Agreement, (a) such employees will remain employees of Provider unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, and may under certain circumstances, be deemed employees of Recipient for specific purposes as determined by Recipient, and (b) while Provider generally remains responsible for the payment of wages, Recipient may, at its discretion, contribute to or assume responsibility for certain wages, bonuses, commissions, or employee benefits, with terms to be negotiated separately for each individual case. The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
        "explanation": "The initial part of the section states that the employees remain employees of the Provider, suggesting the Provider is fully responsible. However, the section then indicates that the Recipient may contribute to or assume responsibility for certain wages and benefits, and that tax responsibilities will be determined on a case-by-case basis. This contradicts the premise that the employees unequivocally remain under the Provider's employment and full responsibility, creating ambiguity about the financial and legal obligations of each party regarding these employees. This could lead to disputes about who is responsible for what concerning employee compensation and tax liabilities.",

        "section": "All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing but may sometimes be given orally if agreed upon. Communications are deemed given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested); (c) communications via facsimile or email are only considered valid if the recipient confirms receipt within 72 hours, otherwise they are deemed not received. (d) Notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.",
        "explanation": "The primary sentence states that all communications should be in writing. However, the provision then allows oral communications if agreed upon. This initial allowance for oral communication contradicts the writing clause. Furthermore, provision (d) states that notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery. This contradicts the earlier part of this paragraph where communications must be delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), which implies an actual delivery requirement. If a notice is dispatched but never arrives, it's unclear whether it's considered 'received' under the agreement.",

        "section": "Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause. However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "The text in this section states that either party may terminate 'at any time without cause.' However, the same section also imposes a 90-day notice period and specifies termination fees. This causes an internal contradiction: if termination is truly at any time, it would be immediate and thus not be preceeded by a 90-day notice period. The requirement of the termination fee further contradicts the 'without cause' provision, as it implies that termination may not be entirely free of consequence or cost, thus creating an obligation.",

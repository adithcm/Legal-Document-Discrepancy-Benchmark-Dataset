        "explanation": "This statement is internally inconsistent. It asserts that due dates are 'guaranteed by the Company' *regardless* of whether the company receives necessary input from the client. This is illogical; the company cannot guarantee a delivery date if the client's actions (or inaction) directly impede their ability to complete the work.  A guaranteed date is impossible to maintain if external factors are uncontrolled. This creates an unenforceable and contradictory term.",

        "explanation": "Section 1. states that the client is to pay the company a sum of 5000$ to design and develop a website in accordance to the scope of work. However, in (a) there is a statement that mentions how 'The costs of any such changes shall be added to the Contract Price.' This introduces ambiguity, as it is not clear if the Client Website design mentioned in Section 1 is to be paid in full. Or, if there is to be a change order, it will affect the payment price stated in Section 1.",

        "explanation": "These two sentences are in direct contradiction. The first asserts a *mandatory* and *unchanging* obligation for the Company to provide Customer Service. The second sentence then *completely negates* this obligation by stating that the company can, at its sole discretion, alter or cease providing service *without any liability*. The Company cannot be both obligated and simultaneously free to abandon that obligation. This creates significant ambiguity and renders the customer service clause virtually meaningless.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "The statement that Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services creates a potential contradiction. While Domini may define the 'scope of contracted services' with the subcontractor, the Trust is contracting with Domini for *all* oversight, administrative, and management services as reasonably requested by the Trust (Section 1). This means Domini is ultimately responsible for ensuring *all* services requested by the Trust are properly executed. This clause attempts to limit Domini's liability beyond its contracted scope with the subcontractor even if it falls under the services Domini promised the Trust. This introduces a contradiction and ambiguity about the extent of Domini's responsibility to the Trust for all aspects of the agreed-upon services.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence says the agreement may be terminated at any time without penalty. The second sentence directly contradicts this by stating that if the Sponsor terminates within the first year, they *will* incur a penalty. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding whether penalties apply upon termination.",

        "explanation": "This section allocates operating expenses to the Trust. However, in the first sentence, it states \"fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement\" are included in those expenses. Section 3 details how Sponsor fees are calculated, creating a clear obligation of the Trust to pay these fees as per that formula. But Section 6 offers contradictory optionality. Section 6 says, \"This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty... by the Sponsor... on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.\" While the Sponsor must give notice, there is no consequence for doing so. The lack of penalty suggests there is no fee required if they terminate, contradicting this section which indicates the Trust is obligated to pay the Sponsor's fee. This conflict over whether the Sponsor has a right to compensation in all circumstances is an inconsistency.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Accuray retains the right to appoint additional exclusive distributors within specific geographic territories, even if those territories overlap with the Distributor's existing customer base.",
        "explanation": "The original text grants a non-exclusive, worldwide distribution right. The added clause allows Accuray to appoint 'additional exclusive distributors' even in areas overlapping with the current distributor. This directly contradicts the non-exclusive nature of the agreement, potentially significantly limiting the distributor's rights.",

        "section": "Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.",
        "explanation": "The original warranty period is clearly defined as one year after installation or 18 months after shipment. The added sentence, 'However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product', directly contradicts and undermines the defined warranty. It also introduces ambiguity regarding the actual duration and scope of the warranty, while the prior sentences disclaim all other warranties. This could be interpreted as an attempt to negate the original warranty and replace it with a vague, unenforceable lifetime warranty.",

        "explanation": "Initially, Accuray or its distributor assumes responsibility for import licenses except in the US. The language is then changes to allow the same responsibility to switch to the distributor and requires that Distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, essentially shifting responsibilities.",

        "section": "Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 1.0% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence sets a general condition for interest on past due balances. However, the second sentence introduces a different condition for distributors who are \"business persons\" under German law (BGB  14), requiring a payment demand note for a payment to be considered past due. This creates a contradiction, as a balance could be overdue under the first sentence (after a certain date) but not under the second (until a payment demand is issued).",

Accuray shall bear the cost of any commission charge for a wire transfer.",
        "explanation": "This clause establishes the payment terms for products, spare parts and upgrades. The key contradiction lies in the omission of the term 'Taxes'. The section states full payment of the prices for Products, upgrades and spare parts shall be 'due net 45 days' which means that the price already includes tax, which contradicts section 5.2.3 that taxes are excluded from the prices referenced in this agreement.",

        "explanation": "There is a significant structural issue here. The 'Agreed Value' for JVLS, LLC is incorrectly stated as $3,500,000.00 USD, the same as BorrowMoney.com, inc. This is highly improbable and likely an error, as JVLS's contribution is primarily cash and significantly smaller in the description. The clause \"Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue, In Add i t i on to The To ta l Contributions.\" also makes no sense. The agreed value of $3,500,000.00 should be the end.",

Thirdly, JVLS, LLC's contribution description is problematic, stating \"Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue From Awarded Contract, In Addition to The Total Contributions.\" This is a structural flaw, not properly conveying information.",

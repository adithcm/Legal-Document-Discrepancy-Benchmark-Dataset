        "section": "8. Term of Joint Venture. The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination. However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "The original text specifies an initial term with a specific end date (February 28, 2004) and requires a written agreement by both parties to extend the term. However, the addition of the sentence that states 'However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days' creates a contradiction. This new sentence allows one party to terminate the agreement prematurely, effectively nullifying the initial term and the requirement for mutual agreement to extend it. It introduces uncertainty as to the actual duration of the agreement, as one party could end it before the agreed-upon end date.",

        "section": "9. Distributions. During the term of the Joint Venture, no interest shall be allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. No Joint Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided, however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "The terms outlined initially state that no distributions of funds can be made without the mutual consent of both parties. All distributions have to be ratably according to their pro rata interest in the Joint Venture, in Section 6. However, there is a contradiction to this outlined rule when it is stated that 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.' There is an ambiguity because the former section states that no money can be transferred without consent, but this payment completely disregards the other portion of the contract.",

        "section": "11. Procedure on Termination and Liquidation. On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "The beginning of section 11 states that during termination, the debt will be paid in a manner that is satisfactory to both Joint Venturers. It is later noted that 'However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.' This goes against what the original statement in the section says, making it a direct contradiction in the text.",

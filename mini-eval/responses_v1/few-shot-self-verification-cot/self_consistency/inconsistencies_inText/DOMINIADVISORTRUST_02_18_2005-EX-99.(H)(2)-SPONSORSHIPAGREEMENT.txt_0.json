Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.",
        "explanation": "This section describes that Domini will cover legal counsel fees. However, the paragraph says that wages and salaries of persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. Does this mean that Domini is not covering legal counsel fees?",

        "explanation": "A clause in the contract specifies that agreement can be terminated at any time with 60 day notice. The clause specifies there is a 10,000 dollar penalty, which makes this a structural legal flaw as penalty clauses are not valid in contracts.",

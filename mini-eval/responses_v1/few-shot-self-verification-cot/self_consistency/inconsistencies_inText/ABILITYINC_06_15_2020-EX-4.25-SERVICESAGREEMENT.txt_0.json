        "section": "As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs. (b) (i) Provider shall provide Recipient with monthly invoices (\"Invoices\"), which shall set forth in reasonable detail, with such supporting documentation as Recipient may reasonably request with respect to Out-of-Pocket Costs, amounts payable under this Agreement, and (ii) payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of an Invoice by Recipient from Provider.",
        "explanation": "The combination of section 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) describes that the Recipient will pay for the services provided and will reimburse the Provider. However, Section 2.2(a) states that the amount is equal to the Provider's actual cost plus a 10% service fee. After this description, it states that if the Provider incurs reasonable expenses, then the Recipient shall reimburse the Provider for the 'Out-of-Pocket Costs'. There is ambiguity in whether the 'actual cost' that is being used to calculate the price already includes Out-of-Pocket Costs. If they are already included, then this would cause the Recipient to be paying for them twice.",

        "explanation": "The term of this agreement in 3.1 is from November 1, 2019, until December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier. Then in section 1.2(f), it states that 'Provider shall at all times during the term of this Agreement maintain, or cause to be maintained, the computer software and computer hardware that is used in connection with the Services with substantially the same degree of care, skill and diligence with which Provider maintains, or causes to be maintained, as of the Effective Date...' This does not make sense because if this agremeent did not exist, then there would be no services to maintain from November 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, because that is what this agreement is for. Therefore, there is no 'same degree of care, skill, and diligence' to compare it to. This does not make sense and is contradictory.",

        "explanation": "Section 5.1 contains a structural flaw in the text. The whole section is a long sentence and has a number of commas and adjectives. This can cause ambiguity in how it is interpreted. For example, the phrase 'relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement' could cause problems in determining liability. 'Arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's gross negligence' is ambiguous as it is not structured in a way to easily point out the direct connection of this gross negligence.",

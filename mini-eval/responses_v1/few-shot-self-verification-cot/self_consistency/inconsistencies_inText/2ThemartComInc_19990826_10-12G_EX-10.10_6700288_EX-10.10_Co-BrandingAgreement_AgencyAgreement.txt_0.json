        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section is problematic because it allows 2TheMart to unilaterally change the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow. The initial agreement sets a formula (0.025% multiplied by the average transaction amount), but this can be changed by 2TheMart at any time, without requiring i-Escrow's consent, with the new rate being effective immediately. This creates a significant imbalance in the agreement and gives 2TheMart the power to arbitrarily increase costs for i-Escrow, potentially making the arrangement economically unviable for them. The phrase 'unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent' directly contradicts the implied principle of mutual agreement in contractual terms, creating a high degree of financial risk for i-Escrow. This contradicts what a reasonable person could expect.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory because it states that 'Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement,' but Section 8.5 *is* the section being described. This creates an internal contradiction because the initial statement indicates that all rights terminate, yet an exception is made for pending transactions, requiring certain provisions to survive. But then it also states that Section 8.5 will not survive. This conflict can create uncertainty in determining the obligations of the parties after termination, especially concerning outstanding transactions.",

In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 Content and or the Services provided to Customers. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the Indemnified Party: (i) giving the Indemnifying Party notice of the relevant claim, (ii) cooperating with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in the defense of such claim, and (iii) giving the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense and settlement of any such claim, except that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that affects the Indemnified Party's rights or interest without the Indemnified Party's prior written approval. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense at its expense.",
        "explanation": "The initial sentence in this section limits the scope of the indemnity to situations where the Indemnified Party is 'deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.' This significantly restricts the circumstances under which indemnification applies. This introductory statement is then followed by additional sentences that appear to provide broader indemnification obligations for specific instances (2TheMart Content, i-Escrow Content, and Services), without explicitly referencing the principal-agent limitation. This creates ambiguity because it is unclear whether the 'deemed a principal' requirement applies to *all* indemnification obligations within this section, or just the first, general one. This misalignment makes it difficult to determine the actual scope of each party's indemnification responsibilities.",

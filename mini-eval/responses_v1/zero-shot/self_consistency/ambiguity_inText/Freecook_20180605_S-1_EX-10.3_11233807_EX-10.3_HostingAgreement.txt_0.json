Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay.",
        "explanation": "The contract guarantees delivery within a specified timeframe, but then states that due dates are not subject to any delay. This is contradictory because it suggests an absolute guarantee alongside an acknowledgement that delays are impossible, which is unrealistic. Guarantees inherently imply the possibility of failure or delay.",

While it states unsolicited positive feedback may be used, it doesn't explicitly state the client consents to this use or that they have the right to revoke this consent.

Does it mean when the website is fully functional, or when all stages outlined in Exhibit A are finished, or some other benchmark?

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This clause attempts to limit Domini's liability for subcontractors' actions to cases of 'gross negligence.' However, generally, a principal (in this case, Domini) is responsible for the actions of its agents (subcontractors) acting within the scope of their authority.  Attempting to waive all responsibility except for gross negligence is a significant departure from standard agency law and could be deemed unenforceable depending on the specific jurisdiction and the nature of the subcontracted duties. It creates a situation where the Trust may have little recourse for damages caused by a subcontractor's simple negligence, even though Domini chose that subcontractor.",

        "explanation": "This section contradicts standard legal principles regarding liability.  Normally, entities are not held liable for mere 'errors of judgment' or 'mistakes of law' unless there is some degree of negligence or breach of duty of care. Holding the Sponsor fully liable for any error, even without negligence, sets an extremely high and unusual standard that is unlikely to be upheld in court. This creates an internal contradiction because it suggests the Sponsor is held to a standard beyond what the law typically requires, potentially making the clause unenforceable in its entirety.",

        "explanation": "The language regarding the termination penalty is ambiguous. It states 'one year of the average management fees collected over the prior three years'. It's unclear if this means the penalty is based on the average fees for *all* series of the trust, or only the series being terminated. This ambiguity creates a contradiction because the actual amount of the penalty could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to disputes. Furthermore, the penalty applies equally to both parties regardless of fault or reason for termination, which may be unusual and could be challenged.",

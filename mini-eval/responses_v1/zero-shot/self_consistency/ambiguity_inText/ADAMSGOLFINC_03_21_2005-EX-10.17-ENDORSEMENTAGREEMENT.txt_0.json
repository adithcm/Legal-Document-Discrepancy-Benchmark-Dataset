        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is limited to print advertising, explicitly excluding personal appearances or television commercials.

        "explanation": "The agreement uses the term \u201cendorsement\u201d to define the consultant\u2019s obligations, but it never defines or discusses the consultant\u2019s rights. This is a structural flaw that affects the legal terms.",

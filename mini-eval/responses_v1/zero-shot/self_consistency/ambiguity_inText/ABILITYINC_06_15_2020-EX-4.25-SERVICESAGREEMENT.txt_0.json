However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity because it states the Provider agrees to provide services in Exhibit A, but then introduces a caveat that Provider is not obligated to provide additional services not in Exhibit A unless it deems it fit and feasible. This introduces a contradiction because it is not clear if the Provider has the power to deny any service that is needed, regardless of what Exhibit A says.",

        "explanation": "This section has an omission in legal terms because it states the Provider shall maintain records, but does not specify the standard for these records, or how long the Provider has to maintain these records. This is a legal contradiction because it does not allow a legal obligation to be enforced due to the lack of information.",

        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity in text because it states that the Recipient shall own all rights to anything conceived by Provider if both parties agree it is related to the services.

It is not defined what happens if both parties do not agree that it is related to the services.",

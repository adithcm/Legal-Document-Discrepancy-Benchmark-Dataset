        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The section stipulates that the advertising fees will be based on the number of Transaction Inquiries and consist of a 'per Transaction Inquiry amount'. However, it does not define the initial 'per Transaction Inquiry amount'. The contract only specifies that this amount ('Adjusted Rate') can be revised later. This is an omission because the initial amount is essential for the agreement to be operational from the Launch Date.",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This section includes a clause stating that if any part of the agreement conflicts with California Escrow Law, the California Escrow Law will prevail. While it's standard to acknowledge governing law, the inclusion of 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict' introduces ambiguity. The California Escrow Law would automatically take precedence regardless of whether the parties try to resolve a contradiction. The clause doesn't create a clear course of action, potentially leading to disputes about how to reconcile the contract with the law.",

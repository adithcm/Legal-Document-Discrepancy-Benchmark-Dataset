        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous because it discusses individuals who devote their time to Domini or its affiliates but are Trustees, officers, and agents of the Trust. This creates a conflict of interest, as these individuals are ostensibly working for both the Sponsor and the Trust, potentially creating ambiguity as to where their loyalties lie and how their salaries are allocated.",

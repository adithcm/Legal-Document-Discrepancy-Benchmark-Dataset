        "explanation": "This sentence is a general statement about maintaining records but lacks specific details about the type of records, the duration for which they need to be maintained, and the accessibility of these records to the Recipient. This ambiguity can lead to disputes about what constitutes adequate record-keeping and whether Provider is fulfilling its obligations. It also lacks legal structure, which is why it does not make sense.",

        "explanation": "This clause is overly broad and could be interpreted to mean that Recipient owns all intellectual property created by Provider, even if it's not directly related to the Services provided under this agreement or if Provider uses pre-existing knowledge or tools. This could lead to disputes about the ownership of intellectual property created by Provider outside the specific scope of the Services. Furthermore, the sentence lacks context in the situation as it is placed randomly in the document.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous because it limits Domini's responsibility for subcontractors' actions to the extent of their liability insurance. This is an in-text contradiction because it suggests Domini is not responsible for acts outside the scope of contracted services. It's unclear what happens if the subcontractor doesn't have liability insurance, or if it doesn't cover all damages caused by the subcontractor's actions. This could expose the trust to liability without recourse.",

        "explanation": "This creates an ambiguity in text. The contract states that the agreement may be terminated without penalty, but this section provides a penalty if the Sponsor terminates within the first year. This is an in-text contradiction, as the first part says there is no penalty, and the second part specifies there will be a penalty, if certain actions occur.",

Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The structural flaw in this section is that it uses a bulleted list of what charges and expenses the Trust shall pay, but it does not actually use bullet points. This makes it harder to understand what items are charges and expenses that the Trust should pay.",

        "section": "1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement. The following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning: 1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, including Australia and other than India and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan. For the avoidance of doubt, 'Accuray Regions' shall only refer to North America.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Accuray Regions' initially includes multiple regions but then is limited to only North America. This creates an in-text contradiction because the initial statement implies a broader scope than the subsequent clarification allows.",

        "section": "4.5. Import License. Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and potential contradiction. It initially states Accuray or its distributor will handle import licenses and be the importer of record for regions outside the U.S. However, it then introduces a condition where, if Accuray lacks a direct presence or specific distributor in the customer's country, it can require the Distributor to enter into a separate distribution agreement, making the Distributor responsible for import licenses and acting as the importer of record. The contradiction lies in the initial statement of Accuray's responsibility versus the conditional shift of that responsibility to the Distributor, dependent on Accuray's presence in the customer's location and with the distributor's consent.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",
        "explanation": "The warranty section states that Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. Then, the section follows this by stating that Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product. The two statements contradict each other. ",

        "explanation": "The definition of \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" is ambiguous and contradictory. It states that the Consultant *must* exclusively use Adams Golf products but then allows for the use of other manufacturers' products if Adams Golf's products are \"deemed unsuitable or unavailable.\" This creates a contradiction because the term \"mandatory\" implies no exceptions, while the added clause provides a broad exception based on the Consultant's discretion. The redacted sections further obscure the specific requirements, making it difficult to determine what constitutes a \"mandatory\" product.",

The contract refers to specific ADAMS GOLF products that are 'mandatory,' but these products are not clearly defined within the visible text.

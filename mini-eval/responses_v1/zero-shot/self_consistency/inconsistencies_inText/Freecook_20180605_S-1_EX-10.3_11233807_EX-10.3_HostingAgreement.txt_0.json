        "section": "However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",
        "explanation": "This section includes contradictory statements regarding the project timeline. First, it guarantees completion within 8 weeks, but then states that due dates in the Scope of Work are subject to delay due to various client-related factors. This creates ambiguity as to whether the 8-week guarantee is absolute or conditional.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "The surcharge for rush work is calculated in two different ways: \"standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%)\" which equals $50 or \"a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.\" This creates ambiguity because it says that \"the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%)\" will apply if it is lower, however, $50 is obviously lower than $100. This needs to be reworded.",

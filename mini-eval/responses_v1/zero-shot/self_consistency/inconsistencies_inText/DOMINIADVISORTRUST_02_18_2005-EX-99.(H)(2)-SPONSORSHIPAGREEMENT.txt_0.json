The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.",
        "explanation": "The text includes conflicting information. Domini covers legal counsel fees, yet the following sentence says \"The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.\" This would mean that legal counsel fees are an exception, which means that the trust would not pay them, but it also states that Domini covers it.",

        "explanation": "The inclusion of a $10,000 penalty for termination introduces a contradiction. Legal contracts typically allow termination with written notice, but imposing a penalty fee may conflict with standard legal practices and could be viewed as an unreasonable restriction on the right to terminate the agreement. Termination penalties have to be enforceable and reasonable to the terms of the contract.",

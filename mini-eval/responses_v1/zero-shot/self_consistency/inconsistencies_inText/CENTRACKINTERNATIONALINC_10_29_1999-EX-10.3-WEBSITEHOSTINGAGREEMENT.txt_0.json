Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section presents two different timelines for ending the contract. The contract renews automatically unless a 5-day notice is given before the end of the term. However, it also states that either party can terminate the agreement at any time with a 30-day written notice. This creates ambiguity. Can someone terminate the contract within the initial term with the 30-day notice, overriding the renewal clause?",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence says that the contract is for 6 months, but it continues for one month periods after that. The second sentence states that if the company would like to terminate the contract they have to give a 5 day notice. The third sentence states that either party may terminate this agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice, which directly contradicts the 5 day notice. ",

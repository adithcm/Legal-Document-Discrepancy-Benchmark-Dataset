        "section": "5. PAYMENT. 5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The contract allows 2TheMart to unilaterally revise the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow. This gives 2TheMart the power to change a fundamental aspect of the agreement (payment terms) without i-Escrow's consent. This is a significant imbalance of power and could be deemed unconscionable or at least raise concerns about good faith.",

        "section": "5.3 AUDIT RIGHTS. i-Escrow shall keep for one (1) year proper records and books of account relating to the computation of advertising payments owed to 2TheMart (including, as appropriate, the computation of the size of average Transaction). Once every six (6) months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with i-Escrow's business activities and with no less than fifteen (15) days notice. i-Escrow shall within two (2) months make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit. Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of five percent (5%) of the payments owed to date, i-Escrow shall immediately pay all cost of such audit.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'payments owed to date' is ambiguous. Does it mean the total payments owed since the beginning of the agreement, or the payments owed within the period covered by the audit? This ambiguity can lead to disputes about whether the 5% threshold has been met, triggering i-Escrow's obligation to pay for the audit.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction. It states that all provisions of the agreement survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete pending Customer transactions. However, it also explicitly states that several sections (including 8.5 itself) do NOT survive expiration or termination. This creates an internal inconsistency because section 8.5 cannot both survive and not survive the termination of the agreement.",

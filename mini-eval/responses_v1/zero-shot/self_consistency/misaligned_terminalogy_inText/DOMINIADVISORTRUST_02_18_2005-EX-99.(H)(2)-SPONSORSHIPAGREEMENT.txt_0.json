        "explanation": "The last sentence of section 1, starting with 'nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent...' appears to be cut off or incomplete. It abruptly shifts the focus from the Sponsor's responsibilities to denying responsibility for functions of other agents, but without a clear transition or connection to the preceding phrase. This makes the sentence structurally flawed and ambiguous in its intent.",

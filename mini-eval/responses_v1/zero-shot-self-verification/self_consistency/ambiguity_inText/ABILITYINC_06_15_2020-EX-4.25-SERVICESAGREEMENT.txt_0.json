        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the Provider's obligations. While the Provider agrees to provide services in Exhibit A, it also reserves the right to refuse additional services 'necessary for the operation of the Recipient' if not in Exhibit A, based on its own discretion of 'fit and feasible'. This creates a contradiction, as the Recipient may rely on the Provider for necessary services, but the Provider can refuse without clear, objective criteria.",

        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and does not make sense. The sentence states 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.' it has the word 'Agreement' twice which indicates this is a structural flaw.",

Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, \"Losses\"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an ambiguity. It states that the Provider indemnifies the Recipient against losses arising from claims of a 'third party or Recipient'. It is unusual and potentially problematic for an indemnification clause to cover claims made by the Indemnified Party (Recipient) against the Indemnifying Party (Provider). Typically, indemnification covers claims from third parties. This could be interpreted as the Recipient being able to claim indemnity for their own actions, which is not standard practice and requires clarification.",

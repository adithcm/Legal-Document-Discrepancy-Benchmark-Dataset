        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it does not specify what happens if the Joint Venturers do not mutually consent to a capital contribution. Does this mean the Joint Venture cannot proceed, or are there alternative funding options? The lack of clarity creates uncertainty about the financial obligations of the parties and the viability of the Joint Venture.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.",
        "explanation": "This creates a contradiction.  The first sentence states the debt should be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third party mediator, regardless of satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. The second part of the statement states any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. This is contradictory because it gives the mediator complete discretion over asset distribution, even if there is money left over to distribute to the venturers.",

        "explanation": "The term \"either joint venturer\" is ambiguous. It is unclear if both joint ventures need to agree on the extention, or just one. It is also unclear on when the notice of extention needs to be provided.",

        "explanation": "This statement is overly broad and potentially unenforceable. While setting expectations for timely delivery is reasonable, asserting that *any* delay is unacceptable, regardless of cause (e.g., client-caused delays in providing content, unforeseen technical issues), is unrealistic and could be deemed unfair or unreasonable in a legal context. It contradicts the common understanding that project timelines are subject to some degree of flexibility and can be impacted by various factors.",

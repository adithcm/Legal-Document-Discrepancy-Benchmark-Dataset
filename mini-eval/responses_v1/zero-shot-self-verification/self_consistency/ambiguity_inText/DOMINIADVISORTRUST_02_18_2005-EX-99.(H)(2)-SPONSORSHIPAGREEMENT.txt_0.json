        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to broaden the liability of the Sponsor by stating they are liable even without willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. This contradicts standard legal principles, which generally require a higher threshold of culpability (such as negligence or intentional misconduct) for liability to be imposed. This is an effort to impose a higher standard of care than what would typically be found in court.",

        "explanation": "The contract states Domini does not need approval from the Trustees to find a subcontracting party qualified, but it also states that Domini is only responsible in cases of gross negligence. These obligations are misaligned, as the Trustees are not able to interfere with Domini's selection of a subcontracting party, which creates a misalignment as they are giving up some responsibilities, while the contract states they have responsibilities.",

        "explanation": "This section allows termination with a penalty of one year's average management fees. The legal contradiction arises because such a high penalty for termination could be deemed an unreasonable restriction on the ability to terminate the contract, potentially conflicting with legal principles that favor freedom of contract but also disfavor clauses that unduly penalize termination.",

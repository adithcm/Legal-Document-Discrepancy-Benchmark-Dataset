        "explanation": "This section states that i-on will maintain the website 24/7 except for maintenance, which they will perform at their convenience without notice. This is contradictory because a guarantee of continuous operation is undermined by the clause allowing for maintenance at any time without notice. This creates ambiguity regarding the expected level of service and uptime.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement for the Hosted Site shall commence upon April 1, 1999 and shall continue for a period of six (6) months, unless earlier terminated in accordance with provisions hereof. This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The contract term is initially for six months and then renews for one-month periods. However, the text also states that either party can terminate the agreement at any time with 30 days' notice. This presents a contradiction: if the contract automatically renews for one-month terms, the 30-day termination clause effectively overrides the renewal term, allowing termination during any renewal period, thus making the renewal term somewhat meaningless.",

        "section": "The Customer acknowledges that the Internet is an unreliable, unsecured, and error-prone network and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any interruptions in service to the Hosted Site or inability for users to reach or effectively use the Hosted Site that arises outside the scope of i-on's responsibilities as explicitly described in this Agreement. The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",
        "explanation": "This section contains ambiguity regarding i-on's responsibility for data loss and service interruptions. While i-on provides mirrored storage and backups, they are held harmless for data loss if they maintain 'reasonable steps.' The term 'reasonable steps' is not defined, creating ambiguity. Furthermore, the initial disclaimer about the internet's unreliability, without a clear definition of i-on's responsibilities, could be interpreted to absolve i-on of responsibility for nearly all interruptions, contradicting the service commitments outlined earlier.",

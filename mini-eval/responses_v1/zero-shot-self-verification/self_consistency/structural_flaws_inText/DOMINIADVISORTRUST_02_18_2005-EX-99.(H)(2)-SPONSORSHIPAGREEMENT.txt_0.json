        "section": "The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder' is ambiguous. While it intends to define the level of culpability required for liability, the term 'reckless disregard' is open to interpretation and can be argued to fall within or outside the scope of gross negligence, potentially creating a loophole where the Sponsor could argue that certain actions, though harmful, do not meet the threshold for liability.",

Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "The limitation of Domini's responsibility to the extent of the subcontractor's insurance coverage is problematic. If the subcontractor's insurance is insufficient to cover damages resulting from their negligence or breach, the Trust may have limited recourse. This clause effectively shields Domini from full liability even if the subcontractor's actions directly result from Domini's choice or oversight.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The clause regarding termination creates an inconsistency. While it states the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty', it then specifies a penalty if the Sponsor terminates within the first year. This creates an in-text contradiction as the Sponsor is penalized for early termination.",

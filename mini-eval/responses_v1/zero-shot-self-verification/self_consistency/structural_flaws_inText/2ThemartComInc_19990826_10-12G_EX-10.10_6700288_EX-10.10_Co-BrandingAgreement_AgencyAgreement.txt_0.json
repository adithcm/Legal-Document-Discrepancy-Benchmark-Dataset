        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "This section allows i-Escrow to unilaterally determine and revise the advertising fees paid to 2TheMart, effectively removing any negotiating power from 2TheMart. The statement 'i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent' makes the agreement one-sided and potentially unfair, as 2TheMart has no control over its compensation. This could be seen as a structural flaw as it creates an unbalanced agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a direct contradiction. It first states that each party shall hold the other's Confidential Information in confidence. However, it immediately contradicts this by stating that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time. This completely negates the confidentiality clause and makes it meaningless.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence is a structural flaw that causes confusion. It is not clear whether 'the agreement will be considered terminated' means that both parties have to provide the notice or just one party. This can cause a lot of confusion.",

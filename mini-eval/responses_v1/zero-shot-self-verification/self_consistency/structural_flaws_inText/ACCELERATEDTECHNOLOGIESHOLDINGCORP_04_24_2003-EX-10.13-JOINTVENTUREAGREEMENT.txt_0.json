        "explanation": "This statement implies that one Joint Venturer can unilaterally demand capital contributions from the other, irrespective of whether the other agrees. This contradicts the principle of mutual agreement typically required in joint ventures for significant financial decisions. It creates ambiguity about how capital contributions are determined and enforced, especially if one party disagrees with the necessity or amount.",

        "explanation": "The requirement for capital contributions determined necessary by *either* joint venturer, regardless of mutual consent, could violate basic principles of partnership law, which generally requires mutual consent for significant financial decisions. Depending on the jurisdiction, a court might find this clause unenforceable as unconscionable or against public policy, especially if one party is significantly disadvantaged. This could create a legal contradiction if enforced, leading to legal challenges based on partnership or contract law.",

However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'All other distributions will adhere to the original terms' is vague because the 'original terms' of distributions are never explicitly stated. This ambiguity makes it unclear what rules govern distributions exceeding the 10% quarterly withdrawal limit.",

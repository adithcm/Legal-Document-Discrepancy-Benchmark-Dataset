The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 20th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The section specifies that the customer is responsible for paying by the 20th of each month, beginning April 1, 1999. It should specify that payment is due the 20th day of each month *after* April 1, 1999. As written, it implies the first payment was already late. It also does not specify which calendar month the payment is due. For example, a payment should be made by the 20th day of May.",

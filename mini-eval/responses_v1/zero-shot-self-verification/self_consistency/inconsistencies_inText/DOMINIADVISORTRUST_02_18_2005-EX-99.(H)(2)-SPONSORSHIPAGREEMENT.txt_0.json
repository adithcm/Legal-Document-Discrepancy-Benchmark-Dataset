        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The statement that Domini will cover the fees of the Trust's legal counsel is contradicted by the prior sentence. The first sentence says that wages and salaries of Domini and affiliates are not expenses incurred by the Trust, however legal counsel fees would likely be an expense incurred by the Trust. Therefore, this statement has a discrepancy.",

        "explanation": "The clause states that the agreement may be terminated at any time with a penalty of $10,000. This contradicts the following clause, 'in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.' If a party must give a 60 day notice, that would mean it could not be terminated at ANY time.",

        "explanation": "This clause contradicts general legal principles regarding liability for subcontractors. Typically, a contracting party (Domini in this case) retains some level of responsibility for the performance and actions of its subcontractors. Stating that Domini is not responsible for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor creates a potential legal contradiction because it attempts to eliminate a standard legal responsibility. This might not be enforceable under all jurisdictions or circumstances, especially if the subcontractor's actions constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

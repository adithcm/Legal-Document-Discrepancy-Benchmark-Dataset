        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the general nature of a service agreement where a provider typically serves multiple clients. While dedication can be interpreted in various degrees, the term 'solely' implies an exclusivity that might not be sustainable or reasonable for the Provider's business operations. This can create ambiguity in the level of commitment expected.",

        "section": "This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",
        "explanation": "The sentence structure is flawed and unclear. It repeats 'Agreement' unnecessarily and lacks proper grammatical structure. The intended meaning is that the agreement is effective from the Effective Date and terminates on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier as per Section 3.2, but the current wording is confusing.",

        "explanation": "While governing law clauses are common, the addition of the parenthetical clause '(including in respect of the statute of limitations or other limitations period applicable to any such claim, controversy or dispute)' creates ambiguity. It suggests the statute of limitations *always* follows Israeli law, even if the nature of the dispute or the parties involved might normally dictate otherwise under general conflict of law principles. This could lead to disputes over the applicable statute of limitations.",

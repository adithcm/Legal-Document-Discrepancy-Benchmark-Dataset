        "section": "Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section states that failure to respond to a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, the subsequent sentence implies that acceptance requires execution of the Purchase Order by Accuray. This creates a contradiction: is a lack of response a disapproval, or is explicit execution required for acceptance?",

        "explanation": "This section grants the Distributor the right to cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray fails to execute it within two weeks of receiving it. This contradicts Section 2.3.3, which specifies that Accuray must either accept or reject the Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt.",

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the obligations of the parties with respect to the Service Agreement are as set forth in Sections 3.6 and 4.8 and (ii) the failure of Distributor to sell a Service Agreement to any Customer shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states the Distributor will make commercially reasonable efforts to sell a service agreement, but then it is stated that the failure to sell the agreement is not a breach of contract. This is a contradiction because it is implying the distributor needs to sell the agreement but if they don't it is okay. This could be more clear and concise.",

        "explanation": "The Term of Contract section does not provide an end date, which creates a discrepancy. It states the start date as September 1, 2004, and mentions a certain number of years and months, but the exact termination date is redacted. Without a defined end date, the duration of the agreement is unclear, potentially leading to disputes regarding the obligations of each party over time.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "The terms under which the consultant may need to repay ADAMS GOLF upon termination of the contract, specifically in the event of death or inability to play, are not structured properly. It is unusual and potentially unconscionable to require the consultant's estate to repay compensation for services not performed due to death or a severe inability to work, especially without clear limitations or considerations for the circumstances.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Paragraph 22 states that repayment will be calculated in the same way as paragraph 8A. Paragraph 8A states that repayment is only required if the consultant doesn't play the minimum number of tournaments. This would mean that there is a legal contradiction if the consultant dies, because he wouldn't be playing any tournaments due to his death, and that is not the same as not playing the minimum number of tournaments.",

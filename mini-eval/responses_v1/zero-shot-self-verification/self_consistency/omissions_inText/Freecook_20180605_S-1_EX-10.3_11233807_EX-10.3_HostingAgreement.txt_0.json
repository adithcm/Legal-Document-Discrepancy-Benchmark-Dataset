The project is set to be 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018 is more than 12 weeks, therefore the terms of the project are misaligned.",

        "explanation": "This section introduces uncertainty by stating that due dates are subject to delay if the company does not recieve the required materials on time, if approvals are delayed by the client or if the scope of work is changed by the client. This undermines the set timeline. It creates ambiguity by allowing the project's terms to shift, making it difficult to hold the company accountable to the original 12-week plan, leading to potential disputes.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'best efforts' is ambiguous and doesn't provide a clear standard for maintenance scheduling. While it states a preference for off-peak hours, it doesn't guarantee it. This can lead to disputes if maintenance significantly disrupts service during business hours. The maintenance window is also quite large (12 hours).",

        "explanation": "The contract states that the website will be developed in accordance with Exhibit A, but then fails to accurately define the deliverable when referencing the Scope of Work. This ambiguity introduces an in-text contradiction. While the contract mentions adherence to the Scope of Work, the absence of concrete deliverables introduces ambiguity. This lack of specificity creates uncertainty and opens the door for potential disputes over the project's goals.",

The absence of detailed specifications makes it difficult to track progress, assess performance, or hold either party accountable for meeting specific targets.

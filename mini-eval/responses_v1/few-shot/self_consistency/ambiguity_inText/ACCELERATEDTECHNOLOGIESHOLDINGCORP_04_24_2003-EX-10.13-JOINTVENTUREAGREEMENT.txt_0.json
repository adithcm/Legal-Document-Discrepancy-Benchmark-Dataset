        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture. The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture, even those instruments that could incur liability or indebtedness for borrowed funds, dispose of assets, or purchase any items for the Joint Venture. The need for written consent or approval is only required for strategic partnerships with other organizations.",
        "explanation": "The clause initially grants each joint venturer full authority over the Joint Venture's affairs, including executing instruments that incur liability or dispose of assets. The added sentence restricts this authority by requiring written consent for strategic partnerships with other organizations. This creates an internal inconsistency as to the extent of each venturer's individual authority, particularly regarding actions that might be considered 'strategic' but not explicitly partnerships.",

        "explanation": "The original term of the joint venture is for a fixed period of one year. The changed text introduces the possibility of one-year extensions if either party provides notice. This creates an inconsistency since either party can enforce the extension, thus it is up to only one parties descretion. ",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the third-party mediator shall determine the fair price and decide which party receives the asset, potentially offsetting balances to ensure fair distribution, as determined by the mediator.",
        "explanation": "The clause stipulates that while unexpended funds are distributed pro rata, all other assets are distributed at the third-party mediator's discretion, irrespective of pro rata interests. This creates a contradiction as it gives the mediator absolute power to override the established ownership structure for the majority of the Joint Venture's assets, making the pro rata distribution of unexpended funds almost inconsequential.",

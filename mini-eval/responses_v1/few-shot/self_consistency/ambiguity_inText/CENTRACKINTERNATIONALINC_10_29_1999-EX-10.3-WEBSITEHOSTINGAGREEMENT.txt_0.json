        "explanation": "The text states that i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, 24/7, except for necessary maintenance. However, it also states that i-on will schedule and perform such maintenance at its convenience, without prior notice. This creates a contradiction because the 'continuous' operation is directly contradicted by the possibility of unscheduled maintenance, which would interrupt the service.",

The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees within 30 days of receiving the invoice. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner may result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence defines the monthly fee, the second gives a 30-day period to pay, but the third suggests immediate interruption or discontinuation of service for late payments. The phrase 'in a timely manner' introduces ambiguity, as it conflicts with the 30-day payment window provided in the previous sentence.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction in the termination clauses. It states that the agreement is for six months, then implies that it may be renewed monthly, and it also states that either party may terminate with a 30-day notice. The inconsistency arises between the initial 6 month period and subsequent monthly renewals, this implies that the contract may be broken. This creates ambiguity.",

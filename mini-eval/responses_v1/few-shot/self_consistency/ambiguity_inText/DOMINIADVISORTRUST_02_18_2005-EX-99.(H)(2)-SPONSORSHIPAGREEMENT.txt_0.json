        "explanation": "Section 4 establishes an unusually high standard of liability for the Sponsor, holding them fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. This contradicts standard legal principles where liability typically requires some degree of fault. This provision may be unenforceable or require very specific interpretation under Massachusetts law.",

        "explanation": "This section states Domini is not fully responsible for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor but only in cases of gross negligence. This contradicts Domini's duty to act in good faith and is further weakened in Secion 4 by the statement that requires the Sponsor to be 'fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law'",

        "explanation": "The termination clause states that the agreement can be terminated at any time with 60 days written notice with payment of a penalty equal to one year of the average managements fees collected over the prior three years.

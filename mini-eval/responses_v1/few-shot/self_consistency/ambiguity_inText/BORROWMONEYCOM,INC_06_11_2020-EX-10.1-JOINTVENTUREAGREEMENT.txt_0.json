        "explanation": "This is a structural flaw in text because Section 11 appears to contradict the idea of joint decision-making because it says that the managers will jointly decide major issues. However, it also says that in the event that the managers are unable to reach an agreement, the decision can be overruled if a majority of the managers votes on a particular outcome. Thus the language here is not structured properly.",

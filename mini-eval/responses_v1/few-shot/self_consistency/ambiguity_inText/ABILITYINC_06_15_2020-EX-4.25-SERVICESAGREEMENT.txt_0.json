However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a contradiction regarding the Provider's obligations. Initially, it states that the Provider agrees to provide services as set forth in Exhibit A. However, it then qualifies this by stating that the Provider is not obligated to respond to requests for additional services not currently in Exhibit A, unless deemed fit and feasible. This creates ambiguity as to the Provider's actual commitment to providing necessary services, potentially leading to disputes over what is considered 'necessary' and 'feasible'.",

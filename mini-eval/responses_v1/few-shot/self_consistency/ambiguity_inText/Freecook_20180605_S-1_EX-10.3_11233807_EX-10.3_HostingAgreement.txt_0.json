        "explanation": "This clause creates an inconsistency. While Company guarantees delivery within the specified timeframe (12 weeks), this clause stating due dates are 'not subject to any delay' is unrealistic and contradictory. Unforeseen circumstances (illness, technical issues, etc.) could reasonably cause delays. It is incongruent with standard business practices.",

        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous. 'Completion of the Scope of Work' is vague. It's unclear what constitutes 'completion'.

        "explanation": "The phrase 'legal counsel fees which Domini will cover' creates an ambiguity. It's unclear if Domini covers all legal fees or only specific ones. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over which legal expenses are Domini's responsibility.",

        "explanation": "The sentence mentions that the termination requires a 60 day written notice, but also states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time'. This makes this requirement ambigious and introduces some contradictions.",

        "explanation": "This statement could be interpreted as conflicting with Domini's overall responsibility for the oversight, administrative, and management services. If a subcontractor's negligence or malfeasance causes harm to the Trust, it's questionable whether Domini can completely disclaim responsibility, particularly if Domini was negligent in selecting or supervising the subcontractor. This can potentially violate regulatory requirements.",

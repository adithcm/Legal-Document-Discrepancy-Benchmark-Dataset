        "section": "8. Term of Joint Venture. The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination. However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction because the contract specifies a fixed term with an option to extend by mutual agreement, but then allows either party to unilaterally terminate with 60 days' notice. This contradicts the idea of a mutually agreed-upon term, as one party can effectively nullify the agreement before the term expires.",

        "section": "9. Distributions. During the term of the Joint Venture, no interest shall be allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. No Joint Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided, however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction in the distribution scheme. It states that distributions can only be made if assets exceed liabilities, yet it also guarantees PVSS a payment of $10,000 per month regardless of profitability or asset value. This undermines the condition that distributions are dependent on the financial health of the joint venture.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "The original text states that if the parties can't agree on a price for an asset during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value. This contradicts the initial procedure that states both Joint Venturers need to agree to a price for assets and it may affect the prorata ownership. It is misaligned due to the terminology not being properly described.",

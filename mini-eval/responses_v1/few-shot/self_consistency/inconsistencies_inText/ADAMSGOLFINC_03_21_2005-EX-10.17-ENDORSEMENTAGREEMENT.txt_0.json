However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "The payment terms in this section are contradictory. The first sentence states that payment must be made within one month of the end of the calendar year (e.g., by January 31st). However, the second sentence introduces a potential delay of up to 90 days in 'extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant', which contradicts the initial firm deadline.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section presents conflicting terms regarding repayment upon termination due to the consultant's inability to play. Initially, it states that repayment is required for the unperformed period. However, it then includes an exception stating that no repayment is required if the inability to play results from an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event. This creates an inconsistency as it isn't clear in other situations if they need to pay.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section regarding termination for cause has an inconsistency concerning repayment. It states that upon termination due to either party's material breach, the consultant repays Adams Golf for the unperformed period. However, it then introduces an exception that the consultant doesn't repay if Adams Golf consistently fails to provide adequate product.",

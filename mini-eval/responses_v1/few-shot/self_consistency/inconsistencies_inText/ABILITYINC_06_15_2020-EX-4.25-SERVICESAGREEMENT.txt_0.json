In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs. (b) (i) Provider shall provide Recipient with monthly invoices (\"Invoices\"), which shall set forth in reasonable detail, with such supporting documentation as Recipient may reasonably request with respect to Out-of-Pocket Costs, amounts payable under this Agreement, and (ii) payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of an Invoice by Recipient from Provider.",
        "explanation": "The text mentions the recipient shall pay provider the actual cost with a 10% service fee. Then it follows with the recipient reimbursing provider for any out of pocket expenses. Then following with monthly invoices, with supporting documentation for out-of-pocket costs and amounts payable. However the text fails to describe the process to calculate the 10% service fee.",

The level of negligence needs to meet gross negligence, which can leave room for interpretation and is ambiguous.

        "explanation": "There is an ambiguity in the text. The first sentence establishes a general rule for interest on past due balances, while the second sentence introduces a condition specific to 'business person' distributors under German law. It's unclear if the interest rate in the first sentence still applies to the German 'business person' distributor, or if the second sentence overrides it entirely, dictating that no interest applies until a payment demand note is issued and ignored.",

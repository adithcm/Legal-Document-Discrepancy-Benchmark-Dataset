Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The contract states a 12-week project timeframe from February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018. It also guarantees completion within 8 weeks with penalties for delays. This creates a contradiction, as it's unclear if the 12-week period is a maximum or if delays beyond 8 weeks trigger penalties, even if within the 12-week window.",

Client may elect to pay Company the Hourly Rate set forth below to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above.",
        "explanation": "It states that the company will not correct any grammatical errors in client submitted content, while at the end of the section it allows clients to pay the hourly rate for typing and proofreading to the company. There is a contradiction because the company is refusing to do it without additonal charge, yet it allows the option of paying for it.",

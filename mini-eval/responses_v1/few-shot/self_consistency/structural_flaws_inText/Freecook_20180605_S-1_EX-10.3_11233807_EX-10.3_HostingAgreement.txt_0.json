        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency in the agreement. The statement that due dates are guaranteed by the Company 'regardless of whether the company receives required materials, documentation, or approvals in a timely fashion from the client' is contradictory and unrealistic. It's impossible for the company to guarantee the due dates if the client is late on any materials that are needed for the project.",

        "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. The original text states that the remaining $3,100 is due on completion of the Scope of Work, but the added sentence allows the client to pay at any time or in installments before completion. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual deadline for the final payment.",

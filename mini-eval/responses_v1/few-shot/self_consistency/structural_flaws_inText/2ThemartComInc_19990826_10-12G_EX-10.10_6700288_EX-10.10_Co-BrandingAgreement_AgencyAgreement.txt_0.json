        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "This clause allows i-Escrow to unilaterally determine and adjust the advertising fees paid to 2TheMart, giving 2TheMart no control over the amount they will receive. The text provides that i-Escrow can change the fees at its discretion without needing 2TheMart's consent. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty for 2TheMart. Additionally, that the per Transaction Inquiry amount is calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion contradicts fair market practices.",

A party's \"Confidential Information\" is defined as any information, regardless of whether it is marked confidential or identified as such, that one party provides to the other. Each party shall hold the other party's Confidential Information in confidence, except that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time. Such restrictions shall not apply to Confidential Information which (a) is already known by the recipient, (b) becomes, through no act or fault of the recipient, publicly known, (c) is received by recipient from a third party without a restriction on disclosure or use, or (d) is independently developed by recipient without reference to the Confidential Information. The restriction on disclosure shall not apply to Confidential Information which is required to be disclosed by a court or government agency. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, within fourteen (14) days of the other party's request, each party will return all Confidential Information and other deliverables to the requesting party.",
        "explanation": "This includes a contradiction. It states that each party shall hold the other's confidential information in confidence, but then immediately contradicts this by stating that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time. This makes the entire section on confidential information meaningless, as it allows for unrestricted disclosure, which creates inconsistency.",

        "section": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party. However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence allows termination by the Sponsor at any time without penalty, provided 60 days' notice is given. However, the subsequent sentence imposes a penalty on the Sponsor if termination occurs within the first year. This contradicts the 'without the payment of any penalty' clause, creating ambiguity regarding the Sponsor's termination rights and associated costs.",

However, the 'notwithstanding' clause later clarifies that the Sponsor isn't responsible for asset management or investment advice. The functions mentioned in the 'notwithstanding' clause falls under management of Trust's assets or rendering of investment advice.",

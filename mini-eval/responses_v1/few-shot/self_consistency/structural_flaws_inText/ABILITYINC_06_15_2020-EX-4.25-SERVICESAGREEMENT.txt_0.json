The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction regarding the employment status and financial responsibilities for Provider's employees. It states that the employees 'will remain employees of Provider' but then adds that they 'may...be deemed employees of Recipient for specific purposes as determined by Recipient.' This creates ambiguity on which party is responsible for the employees, and also creates ambiguity on the taxation responsibilities.",

However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "This section contains an internal inconsistency regarding the conditions for termination. It states that termination can occur 'at any time without cause' but then imposes a termination fee and 90-day notice period. The 90 day notice period seems to contradict the statement of 'at any time'.",

(d) Notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines contradictory rules for when notices are considered 'given'. It states that email is only considered valid if recipient confirms receipt within 72 hours, but if notice sent by mail, is deemed received upon dispatch. This is a misaligment in text.",

        "explanation": "The initial statement indicates that the Sponsor's duties are 'subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees'. However, the following list of duties contains specifics (e.g., maintaining office facilities, supervising administration) that could be interpreted as the Sponsor having independent responsibilities. This creates a potential conflict: does the Sponsor act only when directed, or does it have an obligation to perform these listed duties regardless of specific direction?",

        "explanation": "This clause presents a double negative which can lead to ambiguity. It states the Sponsor shall *not* be responsible for the management of the Trust's assets, investment advice, or distribution of shares and then states the Sponsor shall *not* be deemed to have assumed responsibility for functions of transfer agents, etc. The phrasing is confusing and makes it harder to determine what are the actual responsibilities.",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",

It is confusing because it states that Domini pays these wages and then states that they are not expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of Section 2. It would be better structured if it was stated that these payments made by Domini are not considered expenses of the Trust in calculating compensation for Domini.",

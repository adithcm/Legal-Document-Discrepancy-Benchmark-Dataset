        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The clause defines 'Adjusted Rate' as a rate revised to reflect market conditions. This contradicts the initial statement that advertising fees are based on the number of 'Transaction Inquiries.' The 'Adjusted Rate' introduces ambiguity because the amount paid can fluctuate based on the 'present market conditions', which could include metrics other than transaction inquiries, such as impression or clicks.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "The text states that i-Escrow must comply with California Escrow Law, but also provides a mechanism for the parties to resolve conflicts, implying the agreement can deviate. This creates a contradiction, as the agreement should adhere to mandatory laws.",

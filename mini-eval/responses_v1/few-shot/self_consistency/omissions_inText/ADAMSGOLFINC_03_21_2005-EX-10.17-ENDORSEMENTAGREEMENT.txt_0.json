        "explanation": "The definition of \"PRODUCT\" as simply \"golf clubs\" is overly broad and creates ambiguity. It doesn't specify which types of golf clubs are included (drivers, irons, putters, wedges, etc.). This is an in-text contradiction because later sections (e.g., Section 5) discuss the \"EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT\", but it's unclear if the consultant is obligated to use exclusively Adams Golf clubs for *every* type of club in his bag, or just some. The exception for putters in Section 5 further highlights this initial ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "This definition creates ambiguity because the document fails to define which specific ADAMS GOLF products are considered \u201cMANDATORY PRODUCTS\u201d. Without a clear list or criteria, it\u2019s unclear which clubs the consultant *must* use, and which are optional. This creates a conflict with Section 5, which requires exclusive use of MANDATORY PRODUCT, but leaves the consultant unsure about what products are included.",

        "section": "7. CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "This section refers to PRODUCT suitability, not MANDATORY PRODUCT. Section 5 requires exclusive use of MANDATORY PRODUCT, and this section allows the consultant to reject *any* PRODUCT. This implies that ADAMS GOLF has to replace any ADAMS GOLF product that the consultant find not suitable or terminate the agreement. However, MANDATORY PRODUCT is defined in section 2.C which means the parties have misaligned terminology. ",

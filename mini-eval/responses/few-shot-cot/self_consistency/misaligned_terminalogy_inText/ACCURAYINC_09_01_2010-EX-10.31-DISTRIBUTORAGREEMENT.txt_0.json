        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens. For the purposes of clarity within this document, a Partner is classified as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Distributor\" is strictly Siemens. However, the additional sentence expands the definition to include Siemens' Affiliates or any Third Party granted distribution rights by Siemens, referring to them as a 'Partner'. This creates an in-text contradiction. The terms Distributor and Partner are used interchangeably despite having varying definitions within this document. This misalignment of terminology leads to confusion about who the contractual obligations apply to, e.g., are Siemens Affiliates directly bound by the 'Distributor' obligations, or only Siemens?",

        "explanation": "Section 4.1.1 refers to both 'Retailer' and 'Customer', but the definition of 'Retailer' is not provided. This creates ambiguity because the contract does not define 'Retailer,' leading to confusion about the obligations of Accuray to 'Retailer'. It is unclear who a Retailer is and what their role is in this agreement, therefore also raising questions about whether Accuray also has obligations for a role that has not been properly defined.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'as further described below' is vague. The reader expects to see more details about Accuray's quality assurance responsibilities immediately following this statement, but there is no clear continuation or elaboration on this point in the subsequent paragraphs of Section 4.1. This lack of detail creates ambiguity because the phrase promises more information that is not provided, making the extent of Accuray's responsibility regarding the 'good quality' of goods unclear.",

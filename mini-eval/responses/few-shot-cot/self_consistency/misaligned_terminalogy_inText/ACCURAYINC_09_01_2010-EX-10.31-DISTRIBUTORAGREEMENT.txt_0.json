        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "The contract specifies that the distributorship is non-exclusive and worldwide, but it is limited to 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases.' This limitation introduces ambiguity because it doesn't clearly define if Siemens can distribute individual LINAC or Multi-Modality components separately or if they must always be bundled sales. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over the scope of the distribution rights.",

        "section": "2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section establishes a hierarchy where the Agreement prevails over Quotes and Purchase Orders unless specific high-level approvals and explicit references are made. However, it is unclear how 'inconsistency' is to be interpreted. Does it mean any deviation, or only material deviations that fundamentally alter the agreement? The lack of clarity on the definition of 'inconsistency' can lead to disagreements over enforceability.",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section states that Accuray is responsible for expedited shipping costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, it uses the phrase 'at least six months,' which is vague. Does this mean exactly six months, or more than six months? This ambiguity could lead to disputes over who pays for expedited shipping if the deadline is slightly over six months (e.g., six months and a week).",

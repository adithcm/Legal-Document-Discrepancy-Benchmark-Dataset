This includes, but is not limited to, text, audio files, visual recordings, images, datasets, or programs. Assets given by 2TheMart will be known as \"2TheMart Material,\" while assets given by i-Escrow are termed \"i-Escrow Media.\"",
        "explanation": "This section defines \"Content\" as all digital assets provided by either party. It further refines this by labeling assets from 2TheMart as \"2TheMart Material\" and assets from i-Escrow as \"i-Escrow Media.\" This creates a distinction that is used later in the contract, specifically in the indemnity section (Section 9).",

        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "This section details the advertising fees i-Escrow is supposed to pay 2TheMart. However, it defines the fee calculation based on a percentage of median revenue per customer, which requires consistent tracking and agreement on what constitutes 'median revenue per Customer.' Attaching a 'Revised Pricing' as an exhibit suggests the initial calculation method could change, creating uncertainty if the 'Revised Pricing' is significantly different and not clearly justified.",

Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "This indemnity clause creates several ambiguities. First, it states that the Guarantor protects the Protected Party from liabilities resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, but *only* if the Protected Party is considered a 'key agent' of the Guarantor. The term 'key agent' is undefined, making it unclear when this protection applies. Second, it provides separate indemnity obligations: 2TheMart protects i-Escrow from liabilities derived from \"2TheMart Material,\" and i-Escrow protects 2TheMart from liabilities arising from \"i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.\" The term \"Deliverables provided to Patrons\" is not defined anywhere else in the agreement. This creates confusion as to the scope of i-Escrow's indemnity obligation.",

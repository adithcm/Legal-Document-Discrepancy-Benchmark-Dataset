        "section": "Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 1.0% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces an ambiguity regarding when interest accrues on past due balances. The first sentence states interest accrues on 'any reasonably undisputed amount', implying it starts from the initial due date. However, the second sentence, specific to 'business person' distributors under German law, delays the past due status until after a payment demand note is received. This creates conflicting timelines for interest accrual, depending on the distributor's legal status.",

        "explanation": "The section 'net 60 days after delivery by Accuray' provides inconsistent deadlines with Section 5.4.1.2.1. As the first payment is made four months before shipment, this payment is not possible within 60 days of shipment. This creates an ambiguity as to the actual deadline for the final installment.",

Accuray shall bear the cost of any commission charge for a wire transfer.",
        "explanation": "There is an omission in this section, since it does not take into account tax exempt status, which is mentioned in section 5.4.1.3. In the event that Customer claims tax exempt status in the country where the Accuray System is to be installed, Customer must provide Accuray with sufficient evidence of such tax exempt status prior to delivery of the Accuray System, but there is no language indicating that price changes in Products, Spare Parts and Upgrades also take into account tax exempt status, which is an omission of legal terms. Thus, omission is the reason why this is a legal contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Distributor' in Section 1.3 includes Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights by Siemens. However, the appointment in this section only explicitly mentions appointing 'Distributor,' which could be interpreted as only Siemens itself and not necessarily its Affiliates or Third Parties. This creates ambiguity regarding whether the appointment automatically extends to Siemens' Affiliates and authorized Third Parties.",

        "explanation": "This section restricts Distributor to offering products/services in current price lists, yet Section 2.2.2 allows Distributor to seek Accuray's approval for sales at different prices. This creates a contradiction: one section limits the pricing to current lists, while another allows for deviation with approval, without clearly stating which prevails or when.",

        "explanation": "This section and Section 10.1 provide indemnification for different types of claims (product liability and IP infringement, respectively). However, both indemnification clauses require that Distributor gives Accuray 'sole control of the defense'. This requirement could be problematic. There is no clause that states what happens if the Distributor does not feel comfortable with Accuray having sole control. By them having sole control this puts all the liability on Accuray.",

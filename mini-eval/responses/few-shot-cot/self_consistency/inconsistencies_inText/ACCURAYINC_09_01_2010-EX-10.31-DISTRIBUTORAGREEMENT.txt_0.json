        "section": "5.4.1.1. Letter of Credit. An irrevocable trade finance letter of credit issued by Distributor's bank, confirmed by a bank designated by Accuray in all respects and delivered to Accuray upon the acceptance of the Purchase Order by Accuray. The letter of credit will provide that Accuray can draw against the letter of credit according to the following schedule: 5.4.1.1.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 5.4.1.1.2. Balance upon presentation of documents by Accuray evidencing shipment of the Products to Distributor or Customer as designated in the Purchase Order.",
        "explanation": "Section 5.4.1.1 states that the letter of credit must be delivered to Accuray upon acceptance of the Purchase Order. However, Section 5.4.1.1.1 states that the acceptance must be at least four months prior to the proposed shipment date. It's unclear when the letter of credit needs to be established and delivered relative to these two events, especially if there is a significant delay between the order acceptance and the proposed shipment date, thus creating an ambiguity in the payment timeline.",

        "section": "5.4.1.2. Wire Transfer. A wire transfer made in advance of the date payment is due, made in U.S. dollars, to a bank selected by Accuray, according to the following schedule: 5.4.1.2.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 5.4.1.2.2. The remaining balance is due net 60 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.",
        "explanation": "Similar to the Letter of Credit payment schedule, Section 5.4.1.2 specifies that a wire transfer must be made in advance of the date payment is due but also ties the initial payment to Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order at least four months before the proposed shipment. The remaining balance is due 60 days after delivery and receipt of invoice. There is no clear guidance about how far in advance the full wire transfer should be made.",

        "section": "5.4.1 Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 1.0% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "This creates an ambiguity because the standard interest terms are contradicted by the specific consideration for distributors under German Civil Code. This section could be interpreted as interest being charged immediately after the invoice due date or only after a payment demand note is sent, creating confusion as to when interest charges actually apply.",

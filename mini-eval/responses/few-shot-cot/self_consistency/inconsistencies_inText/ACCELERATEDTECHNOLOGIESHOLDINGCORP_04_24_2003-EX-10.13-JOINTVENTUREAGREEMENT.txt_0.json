        "explanation": "Giving Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. (CCGI) the final say on asset valuation during liquidation creates a structural imbalance and potential for unfair distribution. This contradicts the principle of both parties having equal control and sharing profits/losses equally (Section 6). It allows CCGI to potentially undervalue assets to their benefit, disadvantaging Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. (PVSS). This violates standard principles of fairness in joint ventures.",

        "explanation": "While this clause guarantees a monthly payment to PVSS, it doesn't clarify the source of this payment if the Joint Venture lacks sufficient funds. If the Joint Venture is consistently unprofitable, this could imply CCGI is obligated to cover this payment, which contradicts the shared profit/loss structure outlined in Section 6 (50/50 split). The lack of a provision addressing the funding mechanism in scenarios where the Joint Venture lacks sufficient capital to cover this payment creates ambiguity and potential disputes. Also, it mentions the agreement is not creating a partnership in Section 10.",

It also does not say how often the alternate fulfillment service should be provided. This may cause issues later on if the companies are in disagreement.",

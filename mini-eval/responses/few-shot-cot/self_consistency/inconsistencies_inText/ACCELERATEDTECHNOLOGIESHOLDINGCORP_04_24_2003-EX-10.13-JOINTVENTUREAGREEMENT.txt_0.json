        "section": "5. Powers and Authority of the Joint Venturers.",
        "explanation": "This section grants each Joint Venturer full authority to execute instruments relating to the Joint Venture's affairs, but then immediately restricts this authority by requiring written consent for incurring liabilities, disposing of assets, or making purchase commitments. This creates an in-text contradiction as the initial grant of 'full and complete charge' is significantly limited by the subsequent provisos.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the Joint Venture will use the cash basis of accounting. However, it also requires the Joint Venturers to maintain adequate books and records and submit balance sheets and income statements, which are typically associated with accrual accounting. This creates a contradiction, as balance sheets and income statements are difficult to accurately prepare under a cash basis accounting system.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines the conditions under which distributions can be made to the Joint Venturers, stating that distributions can only occur if the Joint Venture's assets exceed its liabilities after the distribution. However, the section then includes a clause that PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability. This creates an in-text contradiction, as the guaranteed payment to PVSS could violate the condition that distributions can only be made if assets exceed liabilities, especially if the Joint Venture is not profitable.",

        "section": "11. Procedure on Termination and Liquidation.",
        "explanation": "This section describes how assets will be distributed upon termination of the Joint Venture. It states that if any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the parties shall agree on a price for such asset, and it shall be distributed to one party. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value. This creates an imbalance of power and potentially forces one party to accept a potentially unfair valuation of assets.",

        "explanation": "This section is a structural flaw as it is not properly structured and does not make sense. The statement 'Develop a global marketing program for licensed Products Exhibit A attached hereto, describes by way of example but not limitation the responsibilities of the Joint Venturers' is not grammatically correct.",

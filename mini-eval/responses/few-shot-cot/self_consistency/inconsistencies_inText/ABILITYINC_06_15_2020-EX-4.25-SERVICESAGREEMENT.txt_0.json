        "explanation": "The section states that the Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. This is ambiguous as the 'actual cost' is not defined. This could lead to disputes over what costs are considered 'actual' and whether they include overhead, administrative fees, etc. Without a clear definition, the provider could inflate costs leading to legal issues.",

        "explanation": "This clause is separate from the cost of services and is a fixed duration. However, Section 3.1 sets the agreement to terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier. If the agreement terminates earlier than Dec 31, 2021, there's no specification on whether the recipient is still allowed to use the service at no cost. It contradicts the provision of free service until a specific date as it can be terminated earlier.",

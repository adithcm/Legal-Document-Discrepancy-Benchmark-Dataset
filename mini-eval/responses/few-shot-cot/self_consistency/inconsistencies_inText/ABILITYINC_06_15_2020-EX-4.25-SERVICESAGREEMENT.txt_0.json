        "section": "As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "The payment terms are not explicit and provide an ambiguity, as the agreement states that the payment is 'Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee'. However, it doesn't clearly specify if the 'Out-of-Pocket Costs' are included within the 'actual cost of providing the Services' or if they are separate. If Out-of-Pocket costs are already part of the calculation of 'actual cost,' including them again as a separate reimbursement would result in double-counting. This can lead to disputes over the correct amount.",

        "explanation": "This is a structural flaw in text. The sentence is poorly constructed. It refers to the 'Effective Date, Agreement' which is structurally and grammatically incorrect. The sentence also suggests a fixed term until December 31, 2020, but then introduces the condition 'unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2', making this an ambiguious statement.",

        "explanation": "The language 'Provider's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement' limits the scope of indemnification to only these specific instances. It does not cover claims arising from Provider's ordinary negligence, errors, or omissions that may also result in losses to the Recipient. This creates an in-text contradition. The section suggests to provide comprehensive protection to the Recipient (Indemnified Party) but only protects the Recipient from gross negligence rather than any kind of negligence.",

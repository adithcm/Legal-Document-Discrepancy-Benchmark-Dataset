        "explanation": "The agreement identifies two entities, TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, as 'Recipient' but states they are each and both of them the 'Recipient.' This creates a structural flaw because it's unclear whether 'Recipient' refers to both companies jointly or each individually for specific obligations. The phrasing is awkward and can be interpreted in multiple ways.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a structural flaw. The phrase 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' is redundant and grammatically incorrect. It is saying the Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date, which is then followed by the word 'Agreement'. It's repetitive and detracts from clarity. The text is not structured in a way that makes sense.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'Confidential Information' creates ambiguity because there are no explicit exceptions or duration limits on trade secrets. Federal law protects trade secrets indefinitely, but this section doesn't clarify if trade secrets fall under these exceptions. This oversight makes trade secret protection ambiguous.",

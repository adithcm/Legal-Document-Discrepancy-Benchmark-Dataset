        "section": "B.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "The payment terms are inconsistent and lead to an in-text contradiction. The initial sentence mandates payment within one month following the end of the calendar year, setting a clear deadline. However, the subsequent sentence allows for a delay of up to 90 days under certain circumstances. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual deadline, as the extenuating circumstances are subjectively determined by the consultant, and the initial January 31st deadline is immediately contradicted by the possibility of a later due date.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause introduces an in-text contradiction. While stating that ADAMS GOLF *may* terminate the agreement if the CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play, it simultaneously mandates that the CONSULTANT's estate *shall* repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period. This presents conflicting obligations: termination is discretionary for ADAMS GOLF, yet repayment is seemingly obligatory regardless of whether ADAMS GOLF chooses to terminate. It's unclear whether repayment is only required *if* ADAMS GOLF exercises its right to terminate or if the repayment is triggered automatically by the CONSULTANT's inability to play.",

        "section": "23. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause contains an inconsistency regarding repayment upon termination for cause. The initial statement dictates that upon termination for cause by either party, the CONSULTANT *shall* repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed portion of the agreement. However, it then carves out an exception: if the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF's failure to provide adequate product (as per section 17A), the CONSULTANT is not required to repay. This creates a conditional obligation for repayment depending on the *cause* of the termination. The contradiction lies in the fact that CONSULTANT is required to repay for early termination unless it's caused by the party whom is receiving the repayment in the first place.",

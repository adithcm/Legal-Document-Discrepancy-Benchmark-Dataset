        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The section allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fee rate without i-Escrow's consent. While the adjustment is said to reflect 'present market conditions,' the lack of a defined, objective standard for determining these conditions and the absence of a mechanism for i-Escrow to challenge the adjustment creates a significant imbalance. This could be interpreted as a contradiction against the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as 2TheMart could theoretically set an unreasonably high rate, making the agreement financially unsustainable for i-Escrow. This lack of mutuality in determining a key financial term makes the agreement potentially one-sided.",

        "section": "Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The initial clause limits indemnification to situations where the Indemnified Party is 'deemed a principal' of the Indemnifying Party. This is vague and its meaning is not defined. Agency law and principal-agent relationships can be complex, and it's unclear how or when one party would be 'deemed' a principal of the other under this agreement. The subsequent clauses offer specific indemnification obligations related to content and services, these clauses are not clearly subordinate to the initial, broad indemnification clause. This introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction, as it's unclear whether the content/service-related indemnification is also subject to the 'deemed a principal' requirement.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory renewal provisions. First, it states that the agreement can be renewed by 'mutual written agreement.' Second, it states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement 'shall be automatically renewed.' These two provisions create ambiguity: Is a positive mutual written agreement required, or is the absence of a termination notice sufficient for renewal? These are mutually exclusive renewal mechanisms, leading to potential disputes about the agreement's term.",

        "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction. The first sentence states that payments will be made according to Sections 1.3 and 1.4, which presumably outline a specific schedule or set of milestones. The second sentence, however, imposes a blanket requirement of payment within 15 days of receipt of an invoice, regardless of what Sections 1.3 and 1.4 specify. This contradicts the initial reference to those sections and introduces ambiguity about the actual payment terms.",

        "explanation": "There's an in-text structural flaw since the first sentence provides instructions on how the payments of Alliance Funding are calculated, the sentence structure is not correct. Furthermore, there isn't sufficient information to know what 1.3 and 1.4 say.",

        "section": "(c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous because it requires users to complete at least one transaction per month to qualify as a customer. This could be interpreted in two ways: (1) a user is only considered a 'Customer' for a specific month in which they complete a transaction, or (2) a user becomes a 'Customer' after their first transaction and remains one indefinitely. This ambiguity affects how advertising fees based on 'Customers' are calculated.",

This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter.",
        "explanation": "The calculation of advertising fees is based on a percentage of the average transaction amount from 'all Customers' in the preceding quarter. However, Section 1(c) defines 'Customers' ambiguously, making it unclear whether the average should include only those who made transactions in that quarter, or also include previous customers. This ambiguity can significantly alter the calculated advertising fees.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a duplicated sentence: 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.' The duplication adds unnecessary length and does not inherently contradict the rest of the section, but indicates a lack of careful drafting.",

        "section": "Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity. While the Provider agrees to provide services as defined in Exhibit A, it also states that the Provider is not obligated to respond to requests for 'additional services and resources' even if 'necessary for the operation of the Recipient' unless the Provider deems it 'fit and feasible'. This contradicts the initial agreement to provide services if Exhibit A is not fully defined. If Exhibit A is not exhaustive, this clause allows the Provider to refuse essential services, undermining the purpose of the agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section establishes the agreement's term, stating it ends on December 31, 2020. However, Section 3.2 allows either party to terminate the agreement with 90 days' prior written notice. This creates a contradiction: if a party serves notice after October 1, 2020, the termination date would extend beyond December 31, 2020, conflicting with the stated termination date. This makes the actual duration of the contract ambiguous.",

        "section": "Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, \"Losses\"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The indemnification clause is broad, requiring the Provider to indemnify the Recipient against all losses arising from the Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of the agreement. While standard, the phrase 'any and all losses...arising out of...any claim of a third party or Recipient' could be interpreted to include claims directly from the Recipient against the Provider. This overlaps with breach of contract remedies and could create a situation where the Recipient is doubly compensated for the same issue, first through direct damages for breach of contract and then through indemnification. This broadness and potential for double recovery make it potentially problematic and not reflective of standard practice. The addition of 'or Recipient' creates a structural flaw because it can be interpreted as the Provider indemnifying the Recipient for damages that the Recipient claims against the Provider for breaches of the agreement. Indemnification is for 3rd party claims, not the parties involved.",

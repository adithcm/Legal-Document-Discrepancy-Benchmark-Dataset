        "section": "(c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous. It specifies 'at least one transaction per month,' suggesting ongoing monthly activity. However, the agreement elsewhere calculates advertising fees based on transaction inquiries and transactions, without clarifying if these must be recurring monthly transactions to qualify under this definition. This creates uncertainty regarding which users count as 'Customers' for fee calculation and other purposes.",

This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions.",
        "explanation": "The method for calculating advertising fees is ambiguous and potentially contradictory. The fee is based on 0.025% of the average transaction amount from all 'Customers' in the preceding quarter, but 'Customers' is defined as users completing at least one transaction per month (Section 1(c)). This suggests fees are based only on recurring users. However, the agreement also mentions 'Transaction Inquiries,' which may come from new or infrequent users who don't meet the 'Customer' definition. This discrepancy makes it unclear whether fees are calculated based on all inquiries or only those from established 'Customers.'",

        "explanation": "This section creates an exception within the change of control termination clause that is structurally flawed and potentially nonsensical. The exception allows i-Escrow to sell to i-Escrow.com or for i-Escrow.com to sell to i-Escrow's existing shareholders without triggering termination rights. However, the purpose and practical effect of these specific transactions in the context of 'control' being acquired by 'another company' is unclear. This nested exception clouds the intent of the clause, especially as it involves affiliated entities and shareholders, making it hard to determine if a true change of control has occurred.",

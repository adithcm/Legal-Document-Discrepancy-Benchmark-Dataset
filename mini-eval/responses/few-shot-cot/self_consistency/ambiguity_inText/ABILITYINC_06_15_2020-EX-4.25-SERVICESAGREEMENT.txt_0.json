However, the second sentence states that Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible. These two statements contradict each other and make it seem that the Provider does not need to provide services even though it has agreed to.",

However, section 1.1 says that Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources. These two statements contradict each other.

If section 3.2 allows termination at any time, this contradicts that the agreement shall terminate on December 31, 2020.",

(a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "The clause states the Provider is obligated to provide services as outlined in Exhibit A. However, it then qualifies this obligation by stating the Provider is not obligated to respond to requests for additional services not already in Exhibit A unless the Provider deems it fit and feasible. This introduces ambiguity. The original obligation to provide services set forth in Exhibit A becomes less clear because 'services necessary for the operation of the Recipient' might fall under the definition of services already set forth in exhibit A. The provider has some discretion on whether it deems to do certain things or not, it gives a lot of power to the provider. This discretion undermines the original intention to provide services set forth in Exhibit A.",

        "explanation": "The termination date is explicitly set as December 31, 2020. However, Section 3.2 allows either party to terminate the agreement at any time without cause with 90 days' notice. This creates a contradiction. If a party gives notice on October 5, 2020, the termination date would be January 3, 2021 which is past the December 31, 2020. This causes ambiguity whether either clause is valid and which one is to be followed.",

During the term of this Agreement and thereafter, the Parties hereto shall, and shall instruct their respective representatives to, maintain in confidence and not disclose the other Party's financial, technical, sales, marketing, development, personnel, and other information, records, or data, including, without limitation, customer lists, supplier lists, trade secrets, designs, product formulations, product specifications or any other proprietary or confidential information, however recorded or preserved, whether written or oral (any such information, \"Confidential Information\"). Each Party hereto shall use the same degree of care, but no less than reasonable care, to protect the other Party's Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like nature.",
        "explanation": "The confidentiality clause requires each party to protect the other's confidential information with 'no less than reasonable care' than it uses to protect its own. This is problematic because a party might not exercise 'reasonable care' in protecting its own confidential information. The 'no less than reasonable care' requirement creates ambiguity, as it essentially allows a party to protect the other's confidential information poorly, so long as it protects its own similarly poorly. This makes the confidentiality obligation less enforceable and creates a loophole.",

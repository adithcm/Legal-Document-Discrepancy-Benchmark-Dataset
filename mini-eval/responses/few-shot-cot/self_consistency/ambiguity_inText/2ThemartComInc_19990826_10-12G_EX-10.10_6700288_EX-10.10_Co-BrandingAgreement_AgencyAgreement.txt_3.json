        "explanation": "The definition of \"CUSTOMERS\" as those who complete at least one transaction *per month* creates an ambiguity. Does this mean they must complete one transaction every single month to be considered a customer, or is this referring to a cohort that has completed a transaction in the given month?",

In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section describes termination rights after 4 months if the launch date hasn't occurred, but it contains an inconsistency: It states if *only one party* used good faith and reasonable development efforts, *only that party* can terminate. This implies the non-performing party *cannot* terminate, which contradicts the first sentence which grants *either party* the right to terminate after 4 months. The clause is not clear as to whether both parties lose their right to terminate or only one party. ",

        "explanation": "The clause states fees are based on '0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction,' but it does not specify *what* this result should be multiplied by to calculate the total advertising fee. There's a missing element - the actual number of transaction inquiries. This creates an omission and ambiguity in the formula.",

        "explanation": "The redacted values for the term's length and end date create ambiguity. Without knowing the exact duration in years and months, and the specific termination date, it's impossible to accurately determine the agreement's lifespan. This lack of clarity impacts various obligations and timelines within the contract, such as payment schedules, endorsement periods, and termination clauses.",

In all such interviews and appearances, CONSULTANT will use his best efforts to make reference to the ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT and wear [*****] and display ADAMS GOLF'S brand name.",
        "explanation": "Requiring the Consultant to be available for interviews either on Sunday afternoon or Monday morning after a tournament is vague and open to multiple interpretations. It does not define what constitutes 'selected interviews,' nor does it provide criteria for determining which option (Sunday or Monday) is preferable or how the selection is made. The decision-making process or responsibilities are not specified. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about availability expectations and the Consultant's obligations to be present for interviews.",

If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates a 'good faith attempt to resolve the issues' when the Consultant cannot compete due to reasons outside their control, but fails to define what constitutes a 'good faith attempt'. This ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce, creating potential disputes about whether a genuine effort was made before ADAMS GOLF exercises its right to demand prorated repayment.",

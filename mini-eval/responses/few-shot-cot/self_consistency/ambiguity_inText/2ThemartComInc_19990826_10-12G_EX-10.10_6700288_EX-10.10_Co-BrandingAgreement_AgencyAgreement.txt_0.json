        "section": "Adaptimmune shall have responsibility for IND filing, however, MD Anderson will handle all monitoring responsibilities.",
        "explanation": "This clause presents an inconsistency because, generally, the party responsible for IND (Investigational New Drug) filing, which involves submitting comprehensive data and clinical trial protocols to regulatory agencies like the FDA, also assumes the primary monitoring responsibilities for the clinical trial. These responsibilities include ensuring patient safety, data integrity, and compliance with regulations. Separating these duties can lead to coordination issues and potential gaps in oversight, raising concerns about who ultimately ensures adherence to standards and subject safety. This separation is unusual and potentially problematic from a regulatory standpoint, as the IND sponsor (Adaptimmune) typically maintains end-to-end control over the clinical trial process.",

        "section": "Adaptimmune is solely responsible for notifying MD Anderson of data results discovered from Adaptimmune's monitoring visits only.",
        "explanation": "This is a discrepancy because it suggests that Adaptimmune, despite not having primary monitoring responsibilities, is the only party responsible for reporting certain data results to MD Anderson. In standard clinical trial practice, both parties share the responsibility of promptly communicating any findings that may impact subject safety, influence the study's conduct, or alter the IRB's approval. By limiting this responsibility to Adaptimmune for data results from its monitoring visits, there is a risk that crucial information discovered by MD Anderson might not be communicated as promptly or comprehensively as necessary, thus creating potential safety risks and influencing conduct of study.",

The final reconciliation of Data is Adaptimmune's responsibility.",
        "explanation": "The statement appears to assign final data reconciliation responsibilities to both MD Anderson and Adaptimmune, which creates an inconsistency. Assigning the same duty to two different parties causes confusion and potential conflict over processes.",

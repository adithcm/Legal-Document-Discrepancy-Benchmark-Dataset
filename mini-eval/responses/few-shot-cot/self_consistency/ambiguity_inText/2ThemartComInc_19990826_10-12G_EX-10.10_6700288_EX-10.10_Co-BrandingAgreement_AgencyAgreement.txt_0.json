        "section": "(c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'CUSTOMERS' is ambiguous. It states that to be considered a customer, a user must complete at least one transaction *per month*. This is unclear. Does it mean at least one transaction *every* month? Or at least one transaction within a month, but not necessarily every month? This ambiguity can lead to disputes in determining the advertising fees, as the fees are based on transactions from 'Customers'. If the definition is interpreted strictly, a user who skips a month without a transaction would cease to be a 'Customer', which could affect the calculation of advertising fees. This ambiguity could potentially devalue 2TheMart's fees.",

        "explanation": "This gives 2TheMart complete discretion over i-Escrow's advertising on the Co-Branded Site. However, this could be interpreted as an overreach. If 2TheMart arbitrarily withholds approval for advertising that is beneficial to i-Escrow, it may violate the 'good faith' clause in Section 12.8. The contract should include provisions to guarantee advertising for i-Escrow so that 2TheMart does not arbitrarily not allow any advertising.",

        "explanation": "The calculation of advertising fees is based on '0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction.' This is unclear without knowing what the average transaction is. What amount of average transaction are they taking this from and is it agreed upon. This could be a low or high number based on what kind of transaction is agreed upon.",

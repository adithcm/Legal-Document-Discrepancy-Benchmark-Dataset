        "explanation": "The definition of \"CUSTOMERS\" as users who complete at least one transaction *per month* is overly restrictive and misaligned with the payment terms outlined later in Section 5.1, which base advertising fees on Transaction Inquiries. A user could generate multiple Transaction Inquiries in a month but only complete one transaction, still qualifying as a \"Customer\" under this definition but potentially devaluing the advertising fee calculation for 2TheMart. This means that the term Customer should only mean that they complete 1 transaction, not 1 transaction per month.",

        "explanation": "1.  Notice Requirements Contradiction: This section defines how notices are to be given and when they are deemed received. However, the requirements are contradictory: the text states that notice is only deemed given \"only three (3) days after the date of mailing\" if sent by overnight courier. This contradicts the earlier part of the sentence, creating ambiguity regarding the valid methods and timing for delivering legally binding notices.",

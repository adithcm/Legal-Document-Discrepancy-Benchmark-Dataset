        "section": "(c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "This definition of \"CUSTOMERS\" is ambiguous because it defines Customers as users who complete 'at least one transaction per month'. This contradicts the ordinary understanding of the term 'customer' as someone who purchases a service. This definition implies that only users with monthly transactions qualify, which could affect the calculation of advertising fees based on Transaction Inquiries (Section 5.1). It could lead to disputes over whether to include users who make less than one transaction a month in the Customer counts that form the basis for advertising fees.",

Once approved, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently implement their respective obligations under the SOW.",
        "explanation": "This contains inconsistent obligations and potential deadlines. The agreement states that if no SOW is agreed upon within 2 months, either party can terminate. However, it immediately proceeds to state that, once approved, the parties must use commercially reasonable efforts to implement the SOW. This is an inconsistency because it creates uncertainty on if obligations still exist and how to implement them given the SOW disagreement.",

        "section": "12.4 FORCE MAJEURE. Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency with force majeure events. While excusing performance for events beyond control, the section specifies that a force majeure event does not limit obligations under Section 9 regarding indemnification. This is an internal contradiction because the inability to perform due to a force majeure event (like a natural disaster making it impossible to fulfill a service obligation) should logically extend to indemnification claims arising directly from that inability to perform. Making a party responsible for indemnification when their failure stemmed directly from an uncontrollable force majeure is inconsistent.",

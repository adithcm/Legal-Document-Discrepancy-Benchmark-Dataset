        "explanation": "Section 3.2 allows for termination 'at any time without cause' with 90 days' notice, but the clause also states this is 'without liability except, in the case of the Recipient, for required payment for services rendered'. This introduces a contradiction. If the termination is truly 'without liability', specifying the Recipient's payment obligation creates a form of liability for the Recipient that seems inconsistent with the initially stated condition of termination without liability. The payment obligation isn't explicitly waived, but it's unclear if 'without liability' is meant to exclude payment obligations for services rendered until the termination date.",

        "explanation": "The text establishes that the Recipient owns all rights to inventions made by the Provider 'if both parties agree it is related to the services'. This condition introduces an element of uncertainty because it requires mutual agreement to establish ownership. Without this agreement, the ownership of the inventions is unclear, which affects the overall strength and enforceability of the Recipient's intellectual property rights.",

        "explanation": "The term regarding how notices are to be sent creates a contradiction. The text indicates that something will be considered given, 'on the date sent by facsimile or e-mail of a PDF document (with confirmation of transmission) if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next Business Day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient'. It says that if the transmission is sent during normal business hours of the recipient, it is considered given on that date, but if it is sent after normal business hours, then it is considered given on the next business day. This is not aligned since the recipient could easily have viewed this the night it was sent, and the text does not clarify when the notice is considered received by the recipient.",

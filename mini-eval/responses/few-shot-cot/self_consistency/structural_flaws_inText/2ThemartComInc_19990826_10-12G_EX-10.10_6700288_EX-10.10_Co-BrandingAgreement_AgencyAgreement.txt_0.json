        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory because it states that advertising fees are based on Transaction Inquiries, but then it gives i-Escrow sole discretion to determine the per Transaction Inquiry amount and to revise the formula at any time without 2TheMart's consent. This effectively gives i-Escrow complete control over the advertising fees, potentially rendering the 'based on Transaction Inquiries' aspect meaningless. It creates a situation where 2TheMart has no ability to predict or negotiate these fees, making the payment terms uncertain and potentially unfair.",

        "explanation": "This section presents a clear contradiction. It initially states that each party must hold the other's Confidential Information in confidence, which implies a duty of non-disclosure. However, it immediately contradicts this by stating that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time. This completely nullifies the confidentiality obligation, creating ambiguity and rendering the clause ineffective. There is no real confidentiality obligation if disclosure is freely permitted.",

However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency. It states that a force majeure event that lasts 60 days or more allows either party to terminate the agreement without penalty. However, it then clarifies that the occurrence of a force majeure event does not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification) with respect to any third party claim. This means that even if the agreement is terminated due to force majeure, a party might still be liable for indemnification if the third-party claim is related to the force majeure event. It creates an ambiguity as to whether a party can truly terminate 'without penalty' if indemnification obligations remain.",

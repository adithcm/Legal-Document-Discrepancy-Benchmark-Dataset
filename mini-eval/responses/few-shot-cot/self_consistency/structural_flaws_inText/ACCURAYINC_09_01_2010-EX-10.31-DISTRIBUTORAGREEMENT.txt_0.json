        "section": "1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, including Australia and other than India and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan. For the avoidance of doubt, 'Accuray Regions' shall only refer to North America.",
        "explanation": "There is an ambiguity because the definition initially includes multiple regions but then restricts 'Accuray Regions' solely to North America. This creates an in-text contradiction because the first sentence describes multiple regions, but the second sentence limits it to North America, leading to confusion about the actual scope of the term.",

Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Accuray retains the right to appoint additional exclusive distributors within specific geographic territories, even if those territories overlap with the Distributor's existing customer base.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states the distributor is a non-exclusive worldwide distributor, but Accuray retains the right to appoint additional *exclusive* distributors even in overlapping territories. This creates a contradiction as exclusive appointments inherently limit the non-exclusive nature of the original distributor's rights.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). ... However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction related to the warranty period. The warranty is initially defined as one year following installation but no more than 18 months after shipment. The subsequent sentence expands the warranty to cover any defects for the 'expected lifetime' of the product, which conflicts with the explicitly defined warranty period in the preceding sentences.",

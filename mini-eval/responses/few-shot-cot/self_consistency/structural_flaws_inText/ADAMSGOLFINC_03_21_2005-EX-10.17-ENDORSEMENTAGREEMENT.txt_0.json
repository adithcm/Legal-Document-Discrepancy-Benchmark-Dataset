        "explanation": "The contract specifies a term of '[* ****] years and [*****] months' but fails to provide the exact termination date. This omission is a structural flaw and also introduces ambiguity as it is impossible to determine the actual duration of the agreement without the specific year and day of termination. This lack of clarity complicates the enforcement of obligations tied to the contract's end date.",

        "section": "For the entire term of this Agreement, from September 1, 2004 through [*****] ADAMS GOLF *intends* to pay CONSULTANT a base compensation of [*****] dollars. Payment of the base compensation will be subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value.",
        "explanation": "The language stating Adams Golf 'intends' to pay the base compensation weakens the obligation, making it conditional on the company's financial performance and its evaluation of Watson's brand value. This wording introduces ambiguity regarding whether Adams Golf is actually obligated to pay the compensation. This could allow ADAMS GOLF to avoid payment if its financial performance is poor or it decides that Consultant's brand value has decreased, even if Consultant is fulfilling his other obligations under the contract. The lack of a firm commitment to pay creates a significant power imbalance and could be considered an omission of a key term (details on which circumstances would allow for reduced compensation). It creates an in-text contradiction, because the agreement says that payment will be made for the entire term of the agreement, and then states that payment is subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause requires repayment by the Consultant's estate if he dies, but it fails to consider that he may have already fully performed some of the requirements of the agreement, such as promotional appearances. Requiring a repayment without any consideration for the services he has already rendered contradicts that the CONSULTANT performed other obligations, such as PROMOTION OF PRODUCT (Section 10) and PROMOTIONAL APPEARANCES (Section 11). The requirement to repay for the 'period of the Agreement not performed' lacks nuance and could be interpreted unfairly.",

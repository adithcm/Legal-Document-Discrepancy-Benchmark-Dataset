        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as determined necessary by either Joint Venturer, regardless of mutual consent.",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the fundamental principle of a joint venture, which typically requires mutual agreement on significant decisions like capital contributions. Allowing either party to unilaterally determine capital contributions undermines the collaborative nature of the venture and could lead to disputes if one party feels unfairly burdened.",

        "section": "A Joint Venturer may unilaterally withdraw funds or property from the Joint Venture at any time, regardless of the other Joint Venturer's consent. However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
        "explanation": "This section describes two scenarios: an allowance of unilateral withdrawal of funds, with a condition, and an understanding that ALL other distributions adhere to the original terms. It is unclear what the original terms are. It does not explicitly define which terms should be adhered to in normal situations, so this creates ambiguity.",

Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",
        "explanation": "This section states the JV is not intended to create a partnership for legal or tax purposes and elects out of Subchapter K. However, the agreement still refers to the parties as 'Joint Venturers' and outlines profit and loss sharing, typical characteristics of a partnership. The attempt to avoid partnership classification while maintaining partnership-like attributes creates a legal risk.",

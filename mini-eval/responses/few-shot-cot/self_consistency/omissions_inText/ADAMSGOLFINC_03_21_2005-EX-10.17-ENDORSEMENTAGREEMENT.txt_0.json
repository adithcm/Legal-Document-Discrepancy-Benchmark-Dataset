        "section": "B. \"PRODUCT\" shall mean golf clubs.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"PRODUCT\" as simply \"golf clubs\" is overly broad and could lead to in-text contradictions. Later sections refer to \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" which CONSULTANT must exclusively use (golf clubs). If PRODUCT only means 'golf clubs', this creates an ambiguity regarding whether items like golf balls, golf bags, gloves, or apparel could also be considered part of 'PRODUCT' despite not being golf clubs. This is ambiguous because these items are related to golf, and could be interpreted as golf clubs. This is problematic in Section 4, where CONSULTANT is restricted from endorsing PRODUCT made by other manufacturers.",

        "explanation": "The contract lacks a clear definition of what constitutes \u201cADAMS GOLF PRODUCTS.\u201d Without a precise definition, it's unclear which specific items are considered MANDATORY PRODUCTS. This could include golf clubs, golf balls, gloves, apparel, or accessories manufactured and branded by Adams Golf. If it includes accessories or apparel, the agreement doesn't specify what types of each are covered. Without a precise definition of ADAMS GOLF PRODUCTS and mandatory products, it's unclear what is expected of Tom Watson. This is an ambiguity in the text and introduces uncertainty. This leads to a misalignment of terminology.",

        "section": "7. CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines a process for addressing CONSULTANT's dissatisfaction with the MANDATORY PRODUCTS. However, it creates an in-text contradiction: ADAMS GOLF has the option to terminate the contract. If the termination stems from CONSULTANT deeming the PRODUCT unsuitable, he must repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period per Section 23. However, Section 7 allows for prorated compensation, suggesting he might be owed money depending on the termination date. This ambiguity in repayment obligations (whether he repays them or is owed payment) creates uncertainty. There is also ambiguity in whether or not the compensation is determined using section 8A or 23.",

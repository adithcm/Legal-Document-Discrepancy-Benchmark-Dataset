        "explanation": "The agreement states it is entered into on October 1, 2019, but made effective November 1, 2019. This isn't necessarily a contradiction, but it creates a slight ambiguity. It means the parties agreed to the terms on October 1st, but the obligations under the agreement only begin on November 1st. This could affect the interpretation of events between those two dates. For example, preparatory work done between Oct 1 and Nov 1 - would it be considered covered under the agreement if something went wrong?",

        "explanation": "The first part of the sentence states, 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement'. It contains a structural flaw as it mentions the 'Effective Date, Agreement', this makes no sense. This could mean that this section may not be followed properly because it is not written correctly.",

        "explanation": "This is similar to the previous 'conflict of laws' issue. By excluding any conflict of law principles that would cause the application of any law other than the State of Israel, it is trying to unilaterally force Israeli law to apply regardless of where a dispute is heard or the connection of the parties to other jurisdictions. It is very broad. Whether a court in another jurisdiction would actually enforce this provision is questionable, especially if it violates fundamental principles of fairness or public policy in that jurisdiction.",

        "explanation": "The definition provided for 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase' is circular and uninformative. It states that it 'means a purchase,' which provides no clarity on the term's specific meaning within the context of the agreement. This is an in-text contradiction because it fails to define the term in a meaningful way, leading to potential misunderstandings of sections referring to this definition.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an ambiguity regarding responsibility for expedited shipping costs. It states that Accuray bears the costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, it does not explicitly state who bears the costs if the delay is due to Accuray's internal processes or unforeseen circumstances not covered by force majeure. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over shipping costs.",

During the Term, Distributor shall comply, in all material respects, with the Business Conduct Guidelines of Siemens and all other Siemens internal regulations and guidelines.",
        "explanation": "This section shows that Accuray needs to adhere to the Siemens' Code of Conduct, but Siemens, the Distributor, needs to adhere to the Business Conduct Guidelines of Siemens and all other Siemens internal regulations and guidelines. This is a contradiction in terms, which is an in-text contradiction. The text says that each party needs to adhere to their own separate sets of rules.",

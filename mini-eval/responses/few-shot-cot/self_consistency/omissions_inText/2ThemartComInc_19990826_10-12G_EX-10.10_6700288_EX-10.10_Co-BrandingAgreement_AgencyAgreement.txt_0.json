        "section": "2.2 INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT.  The parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the initial operation of the Information Transfer Mechanism and to describe such operation and development fees, in a statement of work (\"SOW\"). Each party shall make available sufficient and qualified engineers to negotiate the SOW. No SOW shall be binding on the parties unless mutually approved by both parties. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "The clause regarding termination if an SOW isn't agreed upon within 2 months provides an easy out for either party early in the agreement. However, the requirement that each party makes 'sufficient and qualified engineers' available is vague. What constitutes 'sufficient' and 'qualified' is not defined, and failure to meet this undefined standard could be used as a pretext for claiming the other party didn't negotiate in good faith. While 'good faith' is mentioned, the subjective nature of this provision and the lack of clear standards makes it potentially unenforceable and open to dispute.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The method for determining the per Transaction Inquiry amount is unclear from the start, and the contract relies on future agreement ('Adjusted Rate') to define it. While 'mutual consent' and 'good faith discussions' are mentioned, there's no baseline rate or mechanism outlined should the parties fail to agree on an adjusted rate. This omission means a crucial payment term is left undefined, rendering the provision potentially unenforceable.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This renewal clause contains a contradiction. It initially requires 'mutual written agreement' for renewal but then states that 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' This creates confusion because the initial statement requires an agreement, while the second suggests that lack of a notice functions as tacit agreement, effectively overriding the mutual agreement requirement.",

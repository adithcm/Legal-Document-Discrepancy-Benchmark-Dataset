        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The original text establishes that advertising fees are based on the number of 'Transaction Inquiries.' Later in the same section, it discusses revising the formula for the 'per Transaction Inquiry amount' to reflect market conditions. This creates an initial structure where the fee is explicitly tied to inquiries, but then introduces a revision mechanism without clearly defining what the formula entails or how its revision impacts the fundamental basis of the fee being tied to transaction inquiries. The lack of clarity about what comprises the 'formula' allows for potential manipulation that could contradict the initial agreement that fees are linked to inquiries.",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This section aims to ensure compliance with California Escrow Law. However, the language 'the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict' is vague and unenforceable. California Escrow Law is regulatory and non-negotiable. By including the language which enables both parties to 'resolve such conflict', this implies that they may be able to work around the escrow law, which is illegal.",

        "explanation": "For i-Escrow, it only defines one address and states that is must be to the 'Attention: President'. But for 2TheMart, it states an address, that it must be to the 'Attention: President', and a fax number. By omitting the 'Attention: President', this creates a contradiction regarding to whom and to where the notice needs to be sent to.",

        "section": "Heritage shall produce the products described on Schedule A and Schedule A-1 attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to time (the Products, each individual unit of Product Unit), for Premier at [***] Heritages or Heritages wholly owned subsidiary, Jaspers facilities (the Facilities).",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"(the Products, each individual unit of Product Unit)\" is confusing. 'Products' is plural while 'Product Unit' is singular, yet they are seemingly used interchangeably, or to define each other. This creates ambiguity as to what exactly constitutes 'Products' versus a 'Product Unit'.",

        "section": "Section 2(c) of the Agreement is amended so that the term Units as defined therein is now referred to as Tetra Units.",
        "explanation": "This section assumes the term 'Units' was previously defined in Section 2(c). Without access to the original agreement, it's impossible to verify if 'Units' was actually defined in that section. If it wasn't, this amendment introduces an omission, and it could be considered a structural flaw because it relies on information that may not exist.",

Heritage shall invoice Premier through the [***] billing as identified on the relevant Schedule C or Schedule C-l.

Premier can reject Products if any individual unit of Product does not meet the Specifications, provided that no more than 5% of units can be rejected based on the Specifications.",

This is an inconsistency. The first sentence uses 'generally conform' while the second sentence states 'shall conform'. This is an inconsistency and contradiction.",

If the final production quantity for any accepted PO is less than [***] of the PO quantity ordered, or if the quantity of production released for shipment within [***] from the last day of production is less than [***] of the PO quantity, upon request by Premier, Heritage *may* take commercially reasonable steps to produce or replace the shortfall within [***], *contingent upon Heritage's then-current production schedule and material availability, as reasonably determined by Heritage*.",
        "explanation": "The use of 'may' followed by the contingency significantly weakens Heritage's obligation to address production shortfalls. While Heritage *may* take steps to rectify the situation, it is only *contingent* on their current schedule and material availability. This creates ambiguity as to whether Heritage is truly obligated to remedy shortfalls or if they can simply decline based on their own internal factors. The phrasing is not strong enough to define the responsibilities of Heritage to replace any shortfalls.",

In all other cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'In all other cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action' is too broad. It could be interpreted to mean that even if a recall is due to a defect in Premier's own formula or specifications (which they provide), Premier would still bear the costs if it doesn't fall under Heritage's negligence, non-compliance, breach, or faulty materials. This seems contradictory to the general principle that a party should be responsible for issues arising from their own contributions.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'which have a material adverse effect on the manufacture or packaging of the Products' introduces ambiguity. What constitutes a 'material adverse effect' is subjective and open to interpretation. This allows Heritage to potentially withhold information about violations that they deem not to have a material adverse effect, even if Premier might disagree.",

        "explanation": "While Premier has the 'sole right' to initiate a recall, they can also 'direct Heritage to conduct' the recall. This raises a question about the extent of Heritage's liability and autonomy. If Premier directs a recall that Heritage believes is unnecessary or improperly scoped, Heritage is still obligated to carry it out.

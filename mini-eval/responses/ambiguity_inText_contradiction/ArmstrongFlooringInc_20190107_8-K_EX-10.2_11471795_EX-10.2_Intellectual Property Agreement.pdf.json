        "explanation": "The section uses inconsistent terminology. 'Sellers' is possessive, but in some instances should be 'Seller's' to denote ownership or belonging to the Seller, for example: 'all of Seller's right'. The inconsistent use of possessives can lead to confusion regarding the intended meaning.",

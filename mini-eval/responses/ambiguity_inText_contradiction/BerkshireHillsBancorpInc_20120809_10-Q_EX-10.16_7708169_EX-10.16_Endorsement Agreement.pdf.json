        "explanation": "The definition of 'SERVICES PERIOD' initially states it ends on May 31, 2014. However, it then extends the Services Period to May 31, 2015, specifically for clause 6(a). This creates an inconsistency, as the general definition contradicts the specific exception.",

        "section": "27. ARBITRATION. Any dispute or difference between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association by a panel of three qualified arbitrators. Berkshire and Auriemma shall each choose an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators so chosen shall choose the third. If either BERKSHIRE or Auriemma fails to choose an arbitrator within 30 days after notice of commencement of arbitration or if the two arbitrators fail to choose a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after their appointment, the American Arbitration Association shall, upon the request of any party to the dispute or difference, appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators to constitute or complete the panel as the case may be. Arbitration proceedings hereunder may be initiated by either BERKSHIRE or Auriemma making a written request to the American Arbitration Association, together with any appropriate filing fee, at the office of the American Arbitration Association in the county in which proceedings are to be held pursuant to the terms of the following sentence. All arbitration proceedings or litigation (to the extent the remedy requested is not, by law, available through arbitration [e.g., injunctive relief]) relating to any claims or disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the county in which the principal executive office of the party not initiating such action or proceeding defendant or responding party) is located.",
        "explanation": "This section states that arbitration should occur in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules, including initiating proceedings at their office. However, the subsequent sentence mandates that all arbitration or litigation be brought in the county where the non-initiating party's principal executive office is located. This creates a conflict: the AAA's rules might dictate a different location or process for initiating arbitration.",

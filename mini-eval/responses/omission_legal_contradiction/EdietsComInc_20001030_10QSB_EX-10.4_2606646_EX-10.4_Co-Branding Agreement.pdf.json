        "section": "Effective one week from the 1 Launch Date, eDiets shall include a back button to the Women.com Site on all pages of the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page. If at any time during the Term of this Agreement, eDiets reasonably believes that the inclusion of such back buttons has a material negative effect upon the rate at which users of the Diet Center register to become members of eDiets or convert into registered participants of the services offered by eDiets on the Diet Center (the \"Negative Effect\"), eDiets may conduct a one (1) month test of the effect of such back buttons which may include the exclusion of the back button. If such test verifies the Negative Effect of the back button(s) to the Women.com Site, eDiets may remove any such back buttons.",
        "explanation": "The clause states that eDiets will include a back button to the Women.com site but then later states that eDiets can remove the back button if it has a negative effect. This contradicts the initial agreement to include the back button.",

In addition to the foregoing and the content guidelines set forth in Section 5.2 [EXCLUSIVITY] hereof, eDiets may not directly link from the Gateway Page to any Women.com Competitive Company (as defined in Section 5.2 [EXCLUSIVITY]).",
        "explanation": "This section restricts eDiets from linking to certain types of content and Women.com competitors from the Gateway Page. However, it is unclear if this restriction applies only to the Gateway Page or to the entire Diet Center. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over what links are permissible within the Diet Center beyond the Gateway Page.",

If Women.com does not deliver at least 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Advertsing Promotions as set forth on Exhibit B (11,250,000 per quarter 45,000,000 per year) 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for the Diet Center Logo as set forth on Exhibit B (3,250,000 per quarter 13,000,000 per year) and 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Other Campaigns as set forth on Exhibit B (3,000,000 per quarter 12,000,000 per year) each quarter following the Launch Date, within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, Women.com shall deliver an amount equal to the under-delivery within the same campaign elements, including newsletters, promotions, exclusive sponsorships, targeted rotations, ROS, channel and sub-channel center logo placements, or mutually agreed upon comparable elements. If Women.com does not deliver the shortfall within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, eDiets may terminate this Agreement in its entirety immediately or authorize Women.com to deliver the shortfall within an extended number of days to be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the \"Make Good Period\"). Should eDiets elect to terminate this Agreement, Women.com shall reimburse eDiets within thirty (30) days of the date of such termination for all pre-paid impressions or other promotions not delivered as of the date of termination. Women.com agrees that if eDiets elects to extend the Agreement the monthly fee due and payable during the Make Good Period will be recalculated and reduced to reflect the changes in the revised delivery schedule.",
        "explanation": "The section outlines remedies for under-delivery of advertising impressions by Women.com. It states that Women.com can make good the shortfall within 60 days, or eDiets can terminate the agreement and receive a reimbursement. However, it also allows eDiets to authorize Women.com to deliver the shortfall within an extended period (the \"Make Good Period\"), during which the monthly fee will be recalculated and reduced. It's unclear how this reduction is calculated and whether it adequately compensates eDiets for the initial under-delivery. The lack of a specific calculation method creates ambiguity and potential for disagreement.",

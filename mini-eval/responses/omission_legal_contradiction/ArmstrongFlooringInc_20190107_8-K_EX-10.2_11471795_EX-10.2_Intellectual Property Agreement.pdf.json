        "explanation": "The definition of 'Arizona' is inconsistent. In the first paragraph, it is defined as 'Licensing and together with Seller, Arizona', suggesting both entities are collectively referred to as Arizona. However, later in the 'WHEREAS' clauses, Arizona is used to refer to only AFI Licensing LLC, separate from the Seller. This creates ambiguity as to which entity the term 'Arizona' refers to in various sections of the agreement.",

        "section": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non- exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), non-assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world only in the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in the form set forth on Schedule 6.1.",
        "explanation": "The trademark license granted in this section is described as 'non-assignable'. However, Section 13.2 allows for assignment under certain circumstances (sale or transfer of applicable business/assets). This creates a contradiction as to whether or not the license can be assigned.",

        "section": "Sublicenses. Arizona may sublicense the licenses granted herein to its Affiliates and Third Parties in the ordinary course of business in support of its and its Affiliates business, but not for the independent use of Third Parties, and the Company may sublicense the licenses granted herein to Third Parties, its Subsidiaries, AWP, controlled Affiliates, or any holding company that is a direct or indirect parent of the Company in the ordinary course of business in support of its and its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates business, but not for the independent use of Third Parties (each such Affiliate, Third Party, AWP or Subsidiary, a Sublicensee). Each Party shall ensure that any sublicense that it grants to a Sublicensee does not conflict with this Agreement. For clarity, granting a sublicense shall not relieve the Parties of any obligations hereunder and each Party shall cause each of its Sublicensees to comply, and shall remain responsible for such Sublicensees compliance, with all terms and conditions hereof applicable to the Parties. At the request of a licensing Party, the other Party shall provide to the licensing Party a list of all Sublicensees and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the licensing Party in connection with Sublicensees compliance with this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The phrasing 'but not for the independent use of Third Parties' is ambiguous. It's unclear what constitutes 'independent use.' Does it mean a Third Party cannot use the sublicense for a business completely unrelated to Arizona or the Company? Or does it mean the Third Party must always be under the direct control of Arizona or the Company when using the sublicense? This lack of clarity could lead to disputes.",

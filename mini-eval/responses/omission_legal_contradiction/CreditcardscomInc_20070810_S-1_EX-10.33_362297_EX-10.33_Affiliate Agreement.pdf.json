        "section": "Affiliates who use this program to apply for credit cards for their own use are NOT in violation of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the general intent of an affiliate program, which is designed for commercial use to generate referrals. Allowing affiliates to use the program for personal credit card applications blurs the line between affiliate and customer, potentially undermining the program's commercial purpose and creating an incentive for personal gain rather than genuine promotion.",

        "section": "Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written or e-mail notice of termination. At the time of termination, any links to Chases Website must be removed immediately. Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein' is redundant. The first sentence already grants Chase the right to terminate the agreement 'at any time, with or without cause'. Therefore, the second sentence adds nothing substantive and creates a potential ambiguity as to whether a breach of terms is required for Chase to terminate.",

        "explanation": "This statement appears to contradict the earlier statement in Section 15, which outlines a specific process for submitting materials incorporating licensed materials for approval, including a timeframe for Chase's response. The statement in Section 14 seems to suggest that *all* uses of Chase Marks, even those already approved under the Section 15 process, require separate written approval, creating ambiguity and potentially conflicting obligations.",

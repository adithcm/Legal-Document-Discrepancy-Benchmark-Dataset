        "explanation": "This section is not clear in the time frame. The theatre passes need to be provided to NCM at least 30 days prior to the month in which such passes first become valid. But the passes themselves do not expire any earlier than 120 days from the date of issuance. The discrepancy is whether the passes need to be valid upon reception or 30 days after. ",

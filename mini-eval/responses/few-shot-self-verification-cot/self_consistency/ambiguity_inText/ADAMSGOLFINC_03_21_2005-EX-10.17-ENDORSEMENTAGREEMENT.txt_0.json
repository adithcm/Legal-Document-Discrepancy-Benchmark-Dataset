        "section": "CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image solely in print advertising campaigns for ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. This excludes any personal appearances or television commercials.",
        "explanation": "This definition limits the scope of the endorsement to print advertising campaigns only and explicitly excludes personal appearances or television commercials. However, Section 11 discusses promotional appearances and television/radio commercials, implying that the consultant will, in fact, participate in these activities. This creates a direct contradiction, as the definition of endorsement restricts activities that other sections of the contract seemingly allow or require.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever practical. The decision on whether to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT in a specific tournament will be at the sole discretion of the CONSULTANT based on performance considerations. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"whenever practical\" creates ambiguity. While the consultant is expected to exclusively use the mandatory product, the phrase allows room for interpretation. The later sentence adds a contradiction because it allows the consultant to use other clubs in the bag, and not endorse it. But the exception undermines the exclusivity agreement and allows for potential confusion. The parties understanding might be different.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "Initially, the consultant is responsible for all liabilities, claims, and expenses, except attorney's fees. But it is quickly followed by another sentence that says ADAMS GOLF covers the consultant's attorney fees up to $10,000. This creates ambiguity regarding the allocation of legal costs and liabilities between the two parties. The two statements are inconsistent, resulting in confusion as to the extent of the consultant's responsibility for attorney fees.",

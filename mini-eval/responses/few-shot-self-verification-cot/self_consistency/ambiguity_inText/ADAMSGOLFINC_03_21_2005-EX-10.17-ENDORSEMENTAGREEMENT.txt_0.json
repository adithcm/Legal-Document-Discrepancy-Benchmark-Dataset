        "section": "1. TERM OF CONTRACT",
        "explanation": "The term of the contract starts in September 1, 2004 and there is a missing end date due to redaction. This is an omission that makes it difficult to ascertain the duration of the contract, leading to uncertainty about the parties' obligations and rights over time.",

        "section": "4. EXCLUSIVITY OF ENDORSEMENT",
        "explanation": "Section 4 outlines restrictions on the Consultant's ability to endorse competing products, but subsection D creates an exception for a specific product ([*****]). However, the conditions under which the Consultant can endorse this product are vaguely defined, particularly regarding the consistency with past advertising practices. The ambiguity arises from the lack of specific criteria defining 'similarly situated professional golfers' and 'competing golf club endorsement agreements,' making it difficult to determine whether the Consultant is adhering to the exclusivity terms.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT",
        "explanation": "The consultant is required to exclusively use MANDATORY PRODUCTS whenever practical, however, the consultant has sole discretion on when to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT based on performance considerations. This creates ambiguity as the term 'performance considerations' is not clearly defined and could be subjective. It may be difficult to objectively verify if the consultant's decision not to use the product was genuinely based on performance, or if it violated exclusivity.",

        "section": "7. CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT",
        "explanation": "Consultant has the power to reject the MANDATORY PRODUCT for not being suitable to him, and ADAMS GOLF would be able to either supply him with a better product or terminate the agreement. If the agreement is terminated, the compensation is prorated. However, the term 'sincere best reasonable judgment' is ambiguous and open to interpretation. This section lacks clarity on what objective criteria would be used to determine if the Consultant's judgment is sincere and reasonable, making the condition subjective and potentially unenforceable.",

        "section": "14. INDEMNITY",
        "explanation": "Consultant agrees to indemnify ADAMS GOLF but ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000. This is a structural flaw as it does not make sense in this structure.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY",
        "explanation": "This section outlines that in the event that the CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate the agreement. If the agreement is terminated, the compensation is prorated and calculated the same way repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A. This creates ambiguity, as it is unclear whether the prorated amount is to be paid to CONSULTANT or repaid to ADAMS GOLF. Considering the title of the section, it can be assumed that the money is meant to be repaid to ADAMS GOLF.",

        "explanation": "In the event that the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The wording 'choose upon the three-arbitrator panel' does not make sense as the panel is meant to have three arbitrators. The wording has a structural flaw that makes it difficult to understand.",

        "explanation": "The redacted terms for the contract's termination date create a significant ambiguity. Without knowing the specific number of years and months, it's impossible to determine the actual end date of the contract. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes about the contract's duration, renewal terms, and the timing of obligations that depend on the contract's termination.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the MANDATORY PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "This clause provides CONSULTANT with a subjective right to deem the MANDATORY PRODUCT unsuitable, allowing ADAMS GOLF to either find a replacement or terminate the agreement. However, termination triggers repayment calculated per paragraph 8A. The contradiction arises because paragraph 8A dictates repayment if CONSULTANT fails to play a minimum number of events, which is distinct from PRODUCT unsuitability. Thus the referenced repayment structure does not correlate with the conditions described, creating ambiguity.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Section 22 allows ADAMS GOLF to terminate the agreement if CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play golf and mandates repayment calculated per section 8A. As mentioned above, section 8A dictates repayment only if CONSULTANT fails to play a minimum number of events, which is distinct from death or inability to play due to other conditions. Using 8A in this case creates an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "(c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'CUSTOMERS' is ambiguous and potentially contradictory. Defining a customer as someone who completes at least one transaction *per month* implies a recurring activity. However, the agreement doesn't specify any ongoing obligation for users to make monthly transactions to maintain their status as a 'CUSTOMER.' This could lead to disputes about the advertising fees based on 'Transaction Inquiries from Customers' (Section 5.1 and 5.2) if users are not actively making monthly transactions. The term 'Customer' is used in Section 5.2 'REPORTING' in relation to the number of new registrations through the Co-Branded Pages; the number of Transaction Inquiries from Customers; the total number of Transactions from such inquiries; the total dollar value of the Transactions. A new registrant would never be considered a customer based on the definition given as a customer must complete one transaction per month, and a new registrant would have had 0.",

All advertising revenue arising from the banner ads shall be solely i-Escrow's. i-Escrow shall not run banner advertisements on the Co-Branded Site for any of 2TheMart's competitors. 2TheMart shall provide in writing, a list of companies they would like to exclude, including every time they wish to change this list.",
        "explanation": "The clause stating 'i-Escrow may place banner advertising on the Co-Branded Site upon prior written approval of 2TheMart, which shall be at the discretion of 2TheMart' creates a structural flaw. It lacks a clear framework for decision-making. The agreement does not define criteria for approval or disapproval and grants full discretion to 2TheMart. There is no obligation to give a reason for denying, potentially opening the door for arbitrary decisions and possible disputes.",

        "explanation": "Section 6.5 states that 'All rights (under any applicable intellectual property right) granted herein are not sublicenseable, transferable or assignable.' This directly contradicts the statement in the same section that '2TheMart may grant sublicenses to companies that 2TheMart has a business relationship with to the extent that 2TheMart Content is visible from such company's web-site through a link or other means.' The statement creates confusion about whether sublicensing is allowed or not, and this would lead to disputes in the event that 2TheMart issued a sublicense.",

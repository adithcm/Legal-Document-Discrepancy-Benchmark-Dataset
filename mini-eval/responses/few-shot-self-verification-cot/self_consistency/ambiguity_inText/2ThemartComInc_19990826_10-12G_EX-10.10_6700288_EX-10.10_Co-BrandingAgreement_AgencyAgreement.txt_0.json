        "explanation": "The original text defines 'CUSTOMERS' as users who complete at least one transaction per month. This is already difficult to enforce, but an additional text was added to this clause that made it contradictory. The text added: \"for which 2TheMart recieves payment\". This creates a contradiction because users can complete a transaction but 2TheMart not receive payment. Thus, this is an ambiguity.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The text uses the same phrase, 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect', twice. This seems repetitive and unnecessary. The second time the statement is presented it is missing the correct number (10) in the sentence. The changed text then causes there to be an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The original text in Section 12.6 outlines how notices should be provided, demanding that notice is only given when physically delivered, or via fax, or using a 'reputable overnight courier'. This excludes regular mail. The change adds a new exception: 'or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, in which event notice shall be deemed given five (5) business days after mailing'. This modification creates a contradiction because regular mail would now be allowed.",

        "section": "2.4 RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS. i-Escrow may place banner advertising on the Co-Branded Site upon prior written approval of 2TheMart, which shall be at the discretion of 2TheMart. All advertising revenue arising from the banner ads shall be solely i-Escrow's. i-Escrow shall not run banner advertisements on the Co-Branded Site for any of 2TheMart's competitors. 2TheMart shall provide in writing, a list of companies they would like to exclude, including every time they wish to change this list.",
        "explanation": "The wording \"at the discretion of 2TheMart\" regarding approval for banner advertising is ambiguous. While it grants 2TheMart the power to approve or disapprove i-Escrow's banner ads, it doesn't specify the criteria for approval or disapproval. This means 2TheMart could arbitrarily disapprove ads, potentially hindering i-Escrow's ability to generate revenue or promote its services. This section gives 2TheMart control over i-Escrow's revenue-generating activities without clear boundaries.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The section states that the advertising fees are based on 'the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter'. However, 'Customers' is defined in Section 1(c) as 'all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.' This creates a misalignment. Should the average transaction amount include ALL users or JUST the ones that satisfy the requirement listed in section 1(c)? This creates ambiguity in determining how advertising fees are calculated.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.\" is written twice consecutively, indicating a structural flaw and redundancy in the text.",

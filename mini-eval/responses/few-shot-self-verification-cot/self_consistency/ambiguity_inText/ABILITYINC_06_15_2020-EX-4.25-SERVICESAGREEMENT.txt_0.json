        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services.",
        "explanation": "Section 1.1(a) states Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible. This creates ambiguity and contradiction. If the services are 'necessary', it implies a level of obligation. The clause 'unless Provider deems it fit and feasible' gives the provider a wide discretion to refuse necessary services, undermining the initial agreement to provide services.",

However Section 1.2(e) states that Provider is not released from responsibility for its obligations under this Agreement in the event that Provider uses any subcontractors to perform any Services. This creates an inconsistency because it is not stated whether the subcontractors are able to provide services outside of the Recipient",

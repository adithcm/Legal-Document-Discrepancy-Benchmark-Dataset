        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This creates ambiguity regarding the scope of services the Provider is obligated to provide. While the Provider agrees to provide services in Exhibit A, the Provider is not obligated to respond to requests by Recipient for additional services necessary for the operation of the Recipient and not contemplated in the Exhibit A. The phrase 'unless Provider deems it fit and feasible' gives the Provider wide discretion to refuse services that are essential for Recipient, which weakens the Recipient's dependence on Provider. This discretion could be interpreted differently depending on the specific circumstances, leading to potential disputes over the Provider's obligations and is an example of ambiguity in text.",

This creates an inconsistency as the agreement terminates prior to the use of [ * * * ] expiring. This is an inconsistency in text, where different sections of a contract provide conflicting obligations.",

        "explanation": "This is an example of structural flaw. The definition of losses is 'Losses', relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. There is no reason as to why Losses is defined in this way. This leads to structural flaws with legal terms as it is hard to read and interpret.",

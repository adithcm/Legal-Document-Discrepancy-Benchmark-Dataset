        "explanation": "The text states that neither joint venturer is entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture, but each joint venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses incurred. However, the following sentence grants either Joint Venturer authority to execute instruments relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture, even those that could incur liability or indebtedness for borrowed funds. This creates a potential contradiction because incurring liability could be considered a service rendered, thus warranting compensation, or it could cause expenses which should be reimbursed.",

This requirement would limit the statement that each party has 'full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture'.",

        "explanation": "This section describes how the Joint Venture's assets will be handled upon termination. It states that debts will be paid in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers, and then unexpended funds will be distributed proportionally. However, it then states that all other assets shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. This creates a discrepancy because it contradicts the principle of prorata ownership, as the mediator can distribute assets unevenly. This could lead to unfair outcomes where one party receives significantly less value than their investment warrants.",

However, Exhibit A describes the responsibilities of the Joint Venturers, but does not speak about a global marketing program for licensed Products.

        "section": "Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The terminology is misaligned in Section 2.1 as it grants Siemens a non-exclusive distributorship worldwide. However, this conflicts with the mention in section 4.4 and 4.5 which states that Accuray may require Distributor to enter a distribution agreement under certain condition. Since section 2.1 does not specifically define what will happen under the mentioned certain condtions as in 4.4 and 4.5, it creates a misalignment.",

        "explanation": "In section 4.6.1, there is ambiguity as to what is meant by 'perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications'. The contract doesn't specify the performance metrics or acceptable deviation limits, and instead relies on a subjective interpretation of 'substantially'. It also omits what happens if there is failure of installment.",

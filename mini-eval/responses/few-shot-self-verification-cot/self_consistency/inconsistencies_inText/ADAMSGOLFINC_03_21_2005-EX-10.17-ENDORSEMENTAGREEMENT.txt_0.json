        "section": "B.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a contradiction. The first sentence mandates payment within one month following the end of the calendar year. The third sentence, through an example, reinforces this by stating a January 31st deadline for the 2005 calendar year. However, the second sentence allows the consultant, under 'certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant,' to delay payment by up to 90 days with written notification. This creates ambiguity because the absolute deadline of January 31st clashes with the potential for a 90-day extension based on the consultant's subjective determination. It is unclear whether the extension applies *after* the initial one-month period or effectively replaces it under qualifying circumstances.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding repayment obligations upon termination due to the consultant's inability to play. The initial part of the section states that if the consultant is unable to play at all, Adams Golf may terminate the agreement. However, it then says that if the failure is due to an injury during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Afterwards, this is contradicted with the statement that upon termination, Consultant and/or Consultant's estate shall be required to repay Adams Golf for that period of the Agreement not performed. This implies repayment is always required except in the injury mentioned earlier, but in all situations. The repayment amount is then dictated in paragraph 8A. The contradiction lies between the first statement 'no repayment shall be required' vs. the statement, 'CONSULTANT... shall be required to repay.'",

        "section": "23. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the conditions under which either party can terminate the agreement for cause and the financial consequences of such termination. It stipulates that if the agreement is terminated due to a material breach by either party, the consultant is required to repay Adams Golf for the unperformed portion of the agreement unless the termination is due to Adams Golf's failure to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. This conditional repayment clause contradicts the 'notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement' statement. If the termination of this agreement is under paragraph 12, Adams Golf can terminate this agreement with no advanced notice, and can claim compensation for not fulfilling their obligations. The presence of a specific exception, 'unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A', suggests that the repayment obligation *would* apply in all other cases of termination for cause, contradicting the broad assertion that this section overrides all others. This creates uncertainty regarding which specific conditions the consultant should repay when the termination is for cause.",

        "explanation": "The Term of Contract section states that the agreement begins on September 1, 2004 and runs for a certain number of years and months, but the exact termination date is redacted. This lack of a defined end date creates ambiguity, especially given the endorsement and payment obligations. This can lead to disputes over when obligations cease, violating contract law principles requiring definiteness.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This termination clause contains an omission that creates ambiguity regarding the termination of the agreement. Section 23 states that if the Consultant repays Adams Golf due to not performing to the standards of the agreement, the repayment amount is calculated in the same way repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A, but if the Consultant doesn't perform due to section 17A, there is no repayment required. The ambiguity lies that it does not state what happens to Adams Golf if they cannot adhere to the agreement and if the agreement is terminated due to that. This can lead to a legal dispute.",

Any and all payments required to be made to SAG or AFTRA or any other organization having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT'S services hereunder, shall be the sole responsibility of CONSULTANT.",
        "explanation": "This is a structural flaw. The sentence, 'This Agreement is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreements with SAG, AFTRA, or any other union agreements or codes having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT'S services hereunder' is not placed properly. It would make more sense to have this statement at the top of the document.",

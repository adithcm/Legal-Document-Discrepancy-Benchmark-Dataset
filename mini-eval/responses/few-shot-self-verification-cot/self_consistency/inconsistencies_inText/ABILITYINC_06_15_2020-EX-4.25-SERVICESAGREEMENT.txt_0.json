        "section": "This Services Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is entered into on October 1, 2019 and is made effective as of November 1, 2019 (the \"Effective Date\") ... and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel (each and both of them \"Recipient\").",
        "explanation": "The agreement lists two companies as recipients, TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd. However, in Section 1.1(b) it states, \"Recipient may freely assign its rights under this Agreement to receive the Services to any of its affiliates.\" This implies a single recipient, making it unclear how assignment works with two named recipients, and creating ambiguity concerning the rights and obligations of each recipient, and how affiliate assignments would be split between them.",

(a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. Notwithstanding the contents of the Exhibit, Provider agrees to respond in good faith to any reasonable request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, at a price to be agreed upon after good faith negotiations between the Parties. Any such additional services and resources so provided by Provider shall constitute Services under this Agreement and be subject in all respect to the provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on the Exhibit as of the date hereof.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the provider must respond in good faith to requests for additional services 'necessary for the operation of the Recipient'. The vagueness of 'necessary' lacks specific criteria, which may lead to disputes. It is unclear who determines what is 'necessary,' and if the provider disagrees, there is no clear mechanism for resolution. This ambiguity impacts the enforceability of the Provider's obligation to provide additional services.",

There's no mention of the scope of usage (e.g., number of users, data limits), support, service levels, or liability. This omission could lead to disputes about what constitutes permissible use and the Recipient's expectations of the service.",

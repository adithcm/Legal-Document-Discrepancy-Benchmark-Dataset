Then the second sentence states that payment is due within 15 days of reciept of invoice. The sections 1.3 and 1.4 should have that information, and not create a contradictory statement in section 4.1.",

        "explanation": "This presents an in-text contradiction. The first sentence specifies a 45-day payment term from the invoice receipt. The second sentence shortens the payment to 10 days if the invoice is delivered in person, which contradicts the initial payment terms. There needs to be an 'unless' statement.",

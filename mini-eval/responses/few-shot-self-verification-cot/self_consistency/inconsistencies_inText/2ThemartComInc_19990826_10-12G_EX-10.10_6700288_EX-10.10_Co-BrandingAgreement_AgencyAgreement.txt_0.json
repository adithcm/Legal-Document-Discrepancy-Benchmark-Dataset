        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section is problematic because it allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fee rate paid by i-Escrow. While it mentions reflecting 'present market conditions,' the complete lack of any objective criteria or limitations on the adjustment opens the door for potentially unreasonable or exploitative rate hikes by 2TheMart. This significantly disadvantages i-Escrow, as it has no control over a key financial term of the agreement. This could also be argued as a failure of consideration on the part of 2TheMart because i-Escrow is subject to any pricing that they decide to impose.",

        "explanation": "This statement in section 6.5 contradicts the explicit prohibition on sublicensing provided earlier in the same section: 'All rights (under any applicable intellectual property right) granted herein are not sublicenseable, transferable or assignable.' While it permits 2TheMart to allow 2TheMart Content to be visible on other websites through links, this is functionally a form of sublicensing because 2TheMart is allowing a third party to use 2TheMart Content. This inconsistency creates confusion and potential disputes over the scope of permissible use of the 2TheMart Content and under what circumstances it is in violation of the agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section limits the protection afforded by a force majeure event, requiring one party to still indemnify the other even if the reason for the claim was a force majeure event. Indemnification is meant to allocate risk arising from specific actions or breaches, but this clause effectively forces a party to cover losses even when caused by events entirely outside of their control. This is overly harsh and creates an imbalance of risk allocation, potentially making one party liable for events they could not prevent or mitigate.",

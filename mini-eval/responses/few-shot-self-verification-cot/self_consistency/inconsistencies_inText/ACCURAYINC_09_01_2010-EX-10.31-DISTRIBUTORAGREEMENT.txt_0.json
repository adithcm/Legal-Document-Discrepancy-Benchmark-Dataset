        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents ambiguity regarding the allocation of expedited shipping costs. It initially states that supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery are borne by Accuray if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the subsequent example clarifies that Accuray bears these costs only if the requested delivery date is six months out, implying Accuray's responsibility extends solely to ensuring the product is shipped out by the agreed-upon date. This may create confusion regarding who incurs costs when the distributor/customer request a date sooner than the six month window.",

        "section": "4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.",
        "explanation": "There is an ambiguity in this section regarding actions taken for a warranty breach. The text states 'Accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non-conforming Product or, if in Accuray's opinion such repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable, Accuray shall refund a pro-rated portion of the price paid by the Customer for such Product calculated based on a straight-line depreciation over a 5-year period beginning on the date of delivery.' However, this section also states, 'This will be Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and such Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective Products and parts.' It is ambigious if Accuray will repair or replace the part or provide a refund. The statement also fails to identify who makes the final decision, customer or Accuray.",

Upon a termination of this Agreement, Accuray shall continue to make available to Customers support services on commercially reasonable terms, including, without limitation, spare parts for the Systems for a minimum period of 10 years after the last shipment of a System pursuant to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The term 'commercially reasonable terms' is ambiguous. It is unclear what specific factors determine this. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the pricing and availability of spare parts post-termination, as 'commercially reasonable' is open to subjective interpretation. There is also an omission of what happens if the customer is not able to agree on 'commercially reasonable terms'",

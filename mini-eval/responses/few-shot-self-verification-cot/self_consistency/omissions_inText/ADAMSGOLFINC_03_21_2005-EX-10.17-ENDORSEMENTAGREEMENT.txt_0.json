        "section": "B. \"PRODUCT\" shall mean golf clubs.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'PRODUCT' as simply 'golf clubs' is overly broad and lacks specificity. Later sections refer to 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS' that the CONSULTANT must exclusively use, and 'non-competitive product.' Without a more precise definition, it's unclear if PRODUCT includes all golf clubs (drivers, irons, putters, wedges), or only specific types. This ambiguity can lead to disputes about what the CONSULTANT is obligated to use exclusively. This lack of clarity creates potential for in-text contradiction since the obligations tied to 'PRODUCT' are vague.",

        "section": "C. \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" shall mean ADAMS GOLF PRODUCTS that CONSULTANT must exclusively play/use in all Champions/Senior Professional Golf Association (SPGA) and Professional Golf Association (PGA) events at all times.",
        "explanation": "While 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS' is defined, its practical application can create an in-text contradiction with section 5. Section 5 states that the CONSULTANT may play clubs other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter. The term 'exclusively play/use' in the MANDATORY PRODUCTS definition is weakened by this exception, but the putter is a golf club which is PRODUCT. Therefore the definition creates an in-text contradiction. If 'PRODUCT' means golf clubs, the exception for the putter directly conflicts with the exclusivity requirement for 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS.'",

        "section": "7. CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "Section 7 creates an ambiguity and possible contradiction. While the CONSULTANT must exclusively use MANDATORY PRODUCTS (as defined), this section allows the CONSULTANT to reject products if they are deemed unsuitable. However, ADAMS GOLF only has 30 days to either supply suitable products *or* terminate the agreement. If ADAMS GOLF chooses to supply different MANDATORY PRODUCTS, and the CONSULTANT deems those unsuitable, there's no clear procedure. Does the 30-day clock restart? Can the consultant repeatedly reject products? If ADAMS terminates agreement, it contradicts the original agreement. This lack of clarity creates ambiguity as to how long Adams Golf has to provide Mandatory Products and what the actual obligations for the CONSULTANT are, given the power to reject products. Section 5 describes that CONSULTANT must exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT.",

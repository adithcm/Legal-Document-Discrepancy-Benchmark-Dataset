        "explanation": "This statement is too vague and does not provide specific details regarding the types of records to be maintained, the duration for which they must be kept, or the level of detail required. This ambiguity creates uncertainty and potential disputes, as it is unclear what constitutes sufficient record-keeping. What specific kind of records must be kept? How long do they have to be saved? What happens if these records are incomplete?",

        "explanation": "While seemingly straightforward, the phrase 'which results from the Services' is ambiguous. Does it mean directly resulting? Indirectly? Is the recipient entitled to own an invention by the provider if the provider was using their own pre-existing knowledge? Without a clear definition, potential disputes could arise over ownership of intellectual property, especially if the Provider independently develops something that builds upon or is related to the Services provided.",

It doesn't specify how the amount is determined, or whether it is a fixed fee, hourly rate, or some other calculation. The specific fee needs to be clarified.

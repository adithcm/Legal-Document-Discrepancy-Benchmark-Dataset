        "explanation": "This definition is structurally flawed because it defines 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase' as simply 'a purchase,' which does not add any clarifying information and renders the term meaningless. The definition should specify what kind of purchase is being referred to, not just 'a purchase'.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section includes contradictory statements regarding who bears the cost of expedited shipping. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the PO submission, Accuray bears the cost. However, it also mentions that Accuray will ship via FedEx ground with no extra insurance if no specific freight carrier is requested, implying that expedited shipping is not the default and potentially contradicts the earlier statement about Accuray bearing the cost for expedited shipping when the six-month condition is met. This creates ambiguity regarding how shipping deadlines and costs are handled.",

        "explanation": "While the clause aims to establish the precedence of this agreement over the Strategic Alliance Agreement in case of conflict, it is structurally flawed by its inclusion of address information for both parties mid-sentence. This disrupts the flow and clarity of the legal text and makes it hard to read.",

        "section": "NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants set forth below, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: <*$p$*>1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement. The following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning: 1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date). 1.2. \"Customer\" means any person or business entity with whom Distributor enters into an agreement for Products or Services pursuant to this Agreement. 1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates. 1.4. \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" means a purchase. 1.5. \"Multi-Modality Purchase\" means the purchase, on a single purchase order, of at least one Distributor imaging product. 1.6. \"Multiple LINAC Purchase\" means the purchase, on a single purchase order, of at least one Distributor linear accelerator product. 1.7. \"Product(s)\" means related products manufactured by or for Accuray for use in the radiosurgery market. 1.8. \"Quote\" means a quote provided by Accuray to Distributor pursuant to Section 2.3 that will serve as the basis for the Product configuration. 1.9. \"Service(s)\" means the performance of services by Accuray or its distributors. 1.10. \"Service Agreements\" means the Accuray CyberKnife Service Agreement. 1.11. \"Spare Parts\" means replacement or additional parts or Products. 1.12. \"Specification(s)\" means the current written description of a Product or Service. 1.13. \"System(s)\" means the Accuray CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System<*$p$*>",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" as simply \"a purchase\" is circular and unhelpful. It doesn't provide any real meaning or context, making it ambiguous and contradicting the purpose of a definition. This lack of clarity could lead to confusion about what constitutes a qualifying purchase under the agreement.",

        "section": "4.5. Import License. Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and potential contradiction. Initially, it states Accuray or its distributor will obtain import licenses. However, it then adds a condition that if Accuray lacks a presence/distributor in the customer's country, it MAY require Distributor to enter a separate agreement and become responsible for licenses and import. The use of 'may require' makes it unclear whether this is always the case, or if Accuray can still choose to handle import in some situations even without a local presence.",

        "section": "<*$p$*>4.6. Warranty. 4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray. \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable. In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. 4.6.2. Hardware and Software. If a Customer notifies Accuray in writing of a defect in a Product that causes the Product to fail to conform to the foregoing warranty, Accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non- conforming Product. This will be Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and such Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective Products and parts.<*$p$*>",
        "explanation": "Section 4.6.1 states that the Products will perform substantially in accordance with the written specifications provided by Accuray. However, the last sentence of the same section disclaims all other warranties including any implied warranties of merchantability. This creates a contradiction. A product that performs to the specifications may still not be merchantable. This clause attempts to limit Accuray's liability, but it could also be argued that it negates the initial warranty statement. This type of broad disclaimer may be unenforceable depending on the jurisdiction.",

        "section": "<*$p$*>10. INDEMNITIES. 10.1. Accuray Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent. 10.2. Products Liability Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement is unsafe, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent. 10.3. Injunctions. If Distributor's rights to use and distribute a Product under the terms of this Agreement are, or in Accuray's opinion are likely to be, enjoined due to the type of claim specified in Section 10.1 (Accuray Indemnity), then Accuray may, at its sole option and expense: (i) procure for Distributor the right to continue to use and distribute such Product under the terms of this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify such Product so that it is non- 17 infringing.<*$p$*>",
        "explanation": "Section 10.3(ii) states Accuray may \"replace or modify such Product so that it is non-infringing.\" This conflicts with 10.4(iv) and (v). 10.4(iv) states Accuray has no indemnity obligation for claims resulting from modifications to a Product not made by Accuray or at its express direction. 10.4(v) states they are not obligated if the distributor fails to use updated products provided by Accuray.",

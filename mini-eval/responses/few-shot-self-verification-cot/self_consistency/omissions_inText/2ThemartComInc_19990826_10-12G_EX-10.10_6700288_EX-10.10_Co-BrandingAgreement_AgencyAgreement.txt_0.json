        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. Once approved, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently implement their respective obligations under the SOW. Upon completion of its duties under the SOW, a party shall notify the other party and provide the other party with the opportunity to test and evaluate its work.",
        "explanation": "This section contains ambiguity. While it provides a mechanism for termination if an SOW isn't agreed upon within 2 months, it doesn't specify the implications or obligations if the parties fail to agree within that timeframe but *continue* to negotiate. Does the termination right expire after 2 months, or does it continue indefinitely? Also, the phrase 'commercially reasonable efforts' is a legal term that is vague and is subject to interpretation and can be seen as ambiguous.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in renewal terms. The clause states that the agreement may be renewed via written agreement, but then specifies that, if no notice is given the agreement is automatically renewed. The meaning is unclear, which could lead to disputes over renewal.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' is ambiguous and potentially problematic. It's unclear what legal standard or factual scenario would trigger this condition. Generally, indemnification is related to the indemnifying party's conduct, not a principal-agent relationship. This condition significantly limits and confuses the scope of indemnification.",

        "explanation": "The term of the contract is not clearly defined due to the redactions. This introduces ambiguity in determining the exact duration of the agreement. Without knowing the specific number of years and months, it is impossible to determine when the agreement actually terminates, which can affect obligations, payments, and termination clauses.",

        "section": "MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section is difficult to understand because the minimum number of events that the CONSULTANT must play to avoid repayment is redacted ( [*****]). This ambiguity makes it impossible to know what level of participation is expected from the CONSULTANT. Further, the phrase 'satisfactory record of play' is also undefined making it subjective and subject to interpretation.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This creates a potentially unconscionable outcome. If the consultant dies or is unable to play due to a debilitating injury, the estate or the consultant is required to repay Adams Golf for services not performed. There may be state law implications and or other issues that arise from this requirement of repayment.",

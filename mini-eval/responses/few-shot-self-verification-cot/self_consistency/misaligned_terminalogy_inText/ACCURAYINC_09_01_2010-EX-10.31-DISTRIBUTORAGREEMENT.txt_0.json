        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states the distributor is appointed as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor. However, Section 4.4 states that Accuray may require the distributor to enter into a distribution agreement pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement if Accuray does not have a direct presence or distributor in the customer's country. This creates a legal contradiction because the distributor's 'worldwide' distribution is contingent on Accuray's presence in a specific country.",

For the purposes of clarity within this document, a Partner is classified as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Distributor\" includes Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party granted distribution rights by Siemens. This is an in-text contradiction because it uses multiple terms ('Distributor,' 'Partner,' 'Affiliates,' 'Third Party') interchangeably without clearly defining how these roles interrelate or differ. This creates ambiguity, especially concerning obligations and liabilities.",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. ... Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph creates ambiguity regarding the responsibility for expedited shipping costs. It says Accuray bears the costs if the deadline is at least six months after submission, but it is not clearly stated what happens if the delivery deadline is not met due to Accuray's fault, despite the six-month window. This creates ambiguity about liability in such scenarios.",

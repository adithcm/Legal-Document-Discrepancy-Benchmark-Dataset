        "explanation": "The definition of \"Distributor\" as Siemens is clear. However, the introduction of \"Partner\" as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party introduces ambiguity. The document does not consistently use \"Partner\" and \"Distributor\" interchangeably, nor does it clearly delineate when \"Partner\" encompasses a broader scope than just Siemens. This misalignment creates confusion about the roles and responsibilities of different entities involved in the distribution process.",

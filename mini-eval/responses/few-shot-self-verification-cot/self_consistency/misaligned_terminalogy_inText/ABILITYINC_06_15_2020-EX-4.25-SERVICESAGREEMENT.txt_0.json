        "explanation": "There's a misalignment in terminology. The recitals section introduces 'Vendor' where 'Provider' should be used, creating confusion. The contract then continues using 'Provider' consistently. The term 'Vendor' is not formally defined but Recipient wishes to engage the Vendor implying it may have been used in a previous agreement. The inconsistent use of 'Vendor' instead of 'Provider' creates an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, including Australia and other than India and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan. For the avoidance of doubt, 'Accuray Regions' shall only refer to North America.",
        "explanation": "This definition provides a list of Accuray Regions but then specifically states that it shall only refer to North America. This creates an ambiguity because the initial part of the definition lists other regions that are specifically excluded by the final sentence.",

To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "This section indicates that failure to respond to a purchase order within two weeks constitutes disapproval, which could cause confusion. However, the following sentence contradicts this by indicating that a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. It is not clear if acceptance is only valid through execution of the Purchase Order and not through a response to the purchase order, or if the response could also mean acceptance.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",
        "explanation": "The first part of the section defines a specific warranty period, but the last sentence then warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product. This creates a contradiction because this statement expands the warranty beyond the explicitly defined warranty period.",

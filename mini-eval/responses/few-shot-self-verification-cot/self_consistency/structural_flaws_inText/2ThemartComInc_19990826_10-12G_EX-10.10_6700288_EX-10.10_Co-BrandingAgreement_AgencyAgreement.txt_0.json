        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "This section gives i-Escrow sole discretion to set and revise the per Transaction Inquiry advertising fees. This creates a structural flaw because it renders the payment obligation of i-Escrow vague and potentially unenforceable, as 2TheMart has no control or input over the fee amount, which lacks sufficient clarity regarding the actual compensation mechanism.",

It first states that parties must keep confidential information private, but then it says they are allowed to share the same confidential information with any third party whenever they want, which makes the confidentiality clause void.",

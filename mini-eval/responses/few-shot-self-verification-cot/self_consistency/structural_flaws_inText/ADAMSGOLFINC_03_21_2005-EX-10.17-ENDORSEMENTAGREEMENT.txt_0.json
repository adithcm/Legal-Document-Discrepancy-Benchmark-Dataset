        "explanation": "The definition of \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" initially states that the Consultant must exclusively use Adams Golf products in all SPGA/PGA events. However, the subsequent sentence allows the Consultant to use products from other manufacturers if Adams Golf's products are deemed unsuitable or unavailable. This creates an ambiguity and an in-text contradiction. The requirement for exclusive use is undermined by the exception, making it unclear under what specific conditions the Consultant is allowed to deviate from using Adams Golf products. The redacted details following numbered points further obscure the precise requirements and exceptions, exacerbating the ambiguity.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall endeavor to achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he *may*, at ADAMS GOLF's sole discretion, be required to repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1.

        "explanation": "The terminology '*may*, at ADAMS GOLF's sole discretion, be required to repay' is ambiguious in this contract and creates an in-text contradiction. It is initially stated that CONSULTANT may be required to repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****]. However, it is ultimately ADAMS GOLF's descision. Therefore, this statement is contridictory because it makes it seem like they must pay.",

Payment of the base compensation will be subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value.",
        "explanation": "The use of the word \"intends\" creates ambiguity in the payment obligation. It is not a definite promise to pay the stated base compensation. This section introduces an ambiguity regarding ADAMS GOLF's commitment to pay the base compensation. The statement that payment is subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of the consultant's brand value further weakens the obligation, making it contingent on factors within ADAMS GOLF's control. The combination of 'intends' and the subjective conditions renders the payment obligation uncertain and potentially unenforceable, since Adams Golf could claim poor performance or a drop in the consultant's brand value to avoid paying the full amount. In addition, the end date of the contract is redacted and makes it so that the financial compensation cannot be calculated.",

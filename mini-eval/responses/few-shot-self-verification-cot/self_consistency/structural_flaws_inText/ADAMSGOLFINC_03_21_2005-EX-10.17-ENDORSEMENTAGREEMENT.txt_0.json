        "section": "TERM OF CONTRACT The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract period is not clearly defined. While the start date is specified, the end date is redacted. Without a defined end date, the duration of the agreement is unknown, creating ambiguity in determining the obligations and rights of both parties. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes regarding the agreement's validity and enforceability over time.",

    {
        "section": "Payment of the base compensation will be subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value.",
        "explanation": "This clause introduces significant ambiguity regarding the base compensation. The phrase 'subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance' makes the payment contingent on an undefined metric. Similarly, 'continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value' is subjective and lacks objective criteria. This ambiguity creates uncertainty for the consultant, as it allows Adams Golf to potentially withhold payment based on vaguely defined and potentially manipulated factors.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section seems to penalize the CONSULTANT's estate after his death or inability to play. It is highly unlikely a court would uphold that ADAMS GOLF is entitled to a refund of fees because the CONSULTANT is deceased, or otherwise is unable to play. This seems to be a contradiction with state law, as the CONSULTANT would not be in breach of the agreement, due to an unforeseen circumstance.",

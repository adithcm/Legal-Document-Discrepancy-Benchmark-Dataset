        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as determined necessary by either Joint Venturer, regardless of mutual consent.",
        "explanation": "This statement is contradictory. Joint ventures typically require mutual consent for significant decisions like capital contributions. Granting either Joint Venturer the power to unilaterally demand capital contributions undermines the collaborative nature of a joint venture and creates a potential for financial abuse or coercion. It contradicts the spirit of partnership and equitable control expected in a joint venture agreement.",

        "section": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until terminated by either party with a thirty (30) day notice, regardless of the original termination date. This termination clause supersedes any prior agreement regarding the venture's term.",
        "explanation": "The sentence 'regardless of the original termination date' makes the text ambiguous as it suggests that the effective termination date is subject to change, creating uncertainty in how the contract is enforceable. This is a direct contradiction, as it sets a commencement date but allows for an unspecified, and potentially immediate, termination. This means that the term of the joint venture is reliant on the whims of the joint venturers, instead of it being concrete.",

However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding fund withdrawal. It states that a Joint Venturer can unilaterally withdraw funds, which goes against the principles of Joint Venture, which dictates that financial distributions are subject to mutual consent. However, this unilateral withdrawal is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's contribution, meaning that any ammount above that requires both parties to come to an agreement. The clause is internally contradictory as it states that the joint venturer can make unilateral withdrawals, but it is limited to 10% of the capital contribution per quarter.",

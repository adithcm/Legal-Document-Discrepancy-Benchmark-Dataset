        "explanation": "This sentence contains a structural flaw in its writing and appears to have a typo or missing words. The phrase 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' is nonsensical and creates an ambiguity as to when the agreement begins, and how the effective date factors into the termination date.",

However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "This section presents conflicting information regarding the termination process. The opening statement grants each party the discretion to terminate the agreement 'at any time without cause,' seemingly suggesting immediate termination. However, the clause continues by imposing a 90-day written notice requirement for termination. This contradiction creates ambiguity about the actual termination process and the extent to which the initial statement of 'at any time' holds true.",

(d) Notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the conditions under which communication is considered given. Clause (c) states that communications via email or fax are valid only if the recipient confirms receipt within 72 hours. Conversely, clause (d) says notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of whether they are actually received. These two clauses contradict one another because email and fax are only valid if the recipient responds, but the mail does not need a response to be considered valid.",

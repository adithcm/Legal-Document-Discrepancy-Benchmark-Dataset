        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It first states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement of the parties' but then says 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' This means that the agreement is automatically renewed if no notice is given, which contradicts the need for mutual written agreement.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The initial sentence of the indemnity clause states that protection is provided only if the 'Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor.' However, the subsequent sentences provide indemnity obligations without mentioning the 'key agent' condition. This creates an ambiguity about whether the 'key agent' condition applies to all indemnity obligations or only the one described in the first sentence.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The term 'Customer Engagements' is used to determine advertising fees, but it is not defined anywhere in the Definitions section (Section 1) or elsewhere in the agreement. This makes it ambiguous how Customer Engagements are counted or measured, leading to potential disputes regarding payment calculations.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The text refers to CONSULTANT achieving a 'satisfactory record of play,' but the term 'satisfactory record of play' is not defined anywhere in the contract. This creates ambiguity as to what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play' and opens the door for disputes. Also, in the same paragraph there is reference to repayment by the CONSULTANT, but the number is redacted, so there is no real understanding to how much he will repay.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Section 22 states that in the event that the CONSULTANT dies the estate is required to repay ADAMS GOLF. But section 14 states that the CONSULTANT will indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. This would make the indemnity in section 14 not applicable in the event of the CONSULTANT's death, creating an in-text contradiction.",

If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "This clause specifies that arbitration will be conducted according to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules and that venue will be in Kansas. However, it does not explicitly state which version of the AAA rules will apply. AAA rules are updated periodically. Failure to specify which version applies can lead to disputes about the applicable procedures. Further, the clause does not address how the arbitrators will be compensated, who is responsible for paying for arbitration fees, etc. These are all critical in an arbitration case.",

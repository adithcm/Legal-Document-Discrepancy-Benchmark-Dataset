        "section": "Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "This section states that failure to respond to a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, it does not specify how the distributor will be notified of this disapproval. This could lead to ambiguity as the distributor may assume the order is still being processed if they don't receive explicit communication.",

        "section": "For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This clause stipulates a six-month lead time for purchase orders. However, Section 4.1.2 states that Accuray will bear supplementary shipping costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the submission of the purchase order. This creates a conflict because Section 3.6 mandates the purchase order be sent six months in advance, while 4.1.2 incentivizes a lead time longer than six months to avoid expedited shipping costs.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction. It states Accuray is liable for damages incurred by the Distributor due to non-compliance with Export Regulations, but then adds a caveat that removes liability if Accuray is 'not responsible' for the non-compliance. This creates ambiguity as to when Accuray is actually liable, weakening the protection offered to the Distributor.",

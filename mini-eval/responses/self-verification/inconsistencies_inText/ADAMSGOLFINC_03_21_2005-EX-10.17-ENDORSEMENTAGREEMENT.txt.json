The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and potential for dispute. While it allows Watson to endorse [*****], it is unclear what specific limitations or guidelines govern this endorsement. The reference to 'past practice' is vague and subjective. The lack of clarity on how CONSULTANT should remedy the situation creates ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce this clause.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1.

However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification.",
        "explanation": "The terms regarding the definition of 'satisfactory record of play' is not described in the text and it is unclear what this means. There is a contradiction, because it states that payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year, but that it may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. This is a contradiction of when the payment should be made.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'material breach' is a legal term, but is not clearly defined within the document. What is considered a material breach is ambiguous, making it hard to enforce. This section states that upon termination CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. This creates an inconsistently on when CONSULTANT should repay ADAMS GOLF.",

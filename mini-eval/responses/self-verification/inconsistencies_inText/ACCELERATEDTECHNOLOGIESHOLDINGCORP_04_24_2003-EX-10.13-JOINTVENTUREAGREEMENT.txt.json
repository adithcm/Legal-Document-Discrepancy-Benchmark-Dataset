        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "This section states that neither joint venturer is entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture, but then goes on to say that they will be reimbursed for all direct expenses. While reimbursement is not direct compensation, the line between the two can blur depending on the services provided and the expenses incurred. If a joint venturer spends a significant amount of time on Joint Venture activities and incurs substantial expenses, the reimbursement could be viewed as a form of compensation, creating a contradiction.",

Then it states However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days. This means that after the agreement commences on March 1, 2003, it can be terminated 60 days after, which is only a few months into the term. This creates an ambiguity within the text.",

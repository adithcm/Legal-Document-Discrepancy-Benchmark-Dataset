Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'relating to/arising out of' includes a slash, which suggests an attempt to include multiple meanings without clear delineation. The intention is unclear whether losses should relate to, arise out of, or both. The wording is ambiguous.",

        "explanation": "The compensation terms lack clarity in calculating the 'actual cost.' Without specific guidelines on what constitutes 'actual cost' and how it is to be determined, this provision is ambiguous.

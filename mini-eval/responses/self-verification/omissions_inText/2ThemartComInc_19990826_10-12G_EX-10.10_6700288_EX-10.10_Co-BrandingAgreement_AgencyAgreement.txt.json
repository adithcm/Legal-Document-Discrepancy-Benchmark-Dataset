        "section": "In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This sentence directly contradicts the preceding sentence. The prior sentence states that the agreement may be renewed for successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement. This sentence states that if notice is not given, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates an inconsistency, because the contract contradicts itself.",

In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence discusses indemnification based on a principal-agent relationship, while the following sentences outline specific indemnification obligations related to content. The initial condition that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party conflicts with the content claims by each party, leading to ambiguity.",

The above sentence indicates that if i-Escrow thinks there is a conflict, they will notify 2TheMart to try to fix it. This is vague because it does not say what happens if they do not resolve the conflict. ",

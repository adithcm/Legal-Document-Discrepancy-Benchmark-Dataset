        "explanation": "This clause is overly broad and could be interpreted to mean that Recipient owns all rights to any invention made by Provider, even if the invention is not directly related to the services provided under the agreement.

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines \"Terms of Payment and Related Matters.\" This section detailing payment terms is said to survive termination of the agreement, however it conflicts with the earlier clause that all obligations are terminated.

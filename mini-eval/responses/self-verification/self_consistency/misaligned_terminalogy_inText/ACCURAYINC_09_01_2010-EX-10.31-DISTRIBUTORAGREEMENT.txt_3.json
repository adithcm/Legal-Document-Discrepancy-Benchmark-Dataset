        "section": "Accuray may introduce changes and upgrades to the Products. Accuray will use commercially reasonable efforts to give Distributor as much advance notice of upgrades as is feasible.",
        "explanation": "While Accuray commits to providing advance notice, the term \"as much advance notice as is feasible\" is ambiguous. There is no specified timeframe, making it difficult to enforce this obligation. What is feasible for Accuray may not be reasonable for Distributor, potentially leading to disputes.",

        "section": "Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section is confusing. It states Accuray will pay for expedited shipping if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order. The example then states a purchase order submitted June 1 with a requested delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months) will have expedited delivery paid for by Accuray. This is clear. However, the second example of a June 1 purchase order with an October 1 delivery date implies the distributor pays, but October 1 is less than six months, and the first sentence only states Accuray pays if it is at least six months. It is not clear what happens if the requested date is less than six months.",

Distributor shall receive a commission in the amount specified in Exhibit A hereto for any Service Agreement entered into by Accuray with Customer pursuant to Section 4.8.",
        "explanation": "There is an in-text contradiction. It refers to 'any applicable discounts as specified in Exhibit A', in the first sentence and in the second sentence it refers to 'commission in the amount specified in Exhibit A'. There is no mention of which it is. It does not define multiple discounts within the exhibit, so this is a contradiction within the text.",

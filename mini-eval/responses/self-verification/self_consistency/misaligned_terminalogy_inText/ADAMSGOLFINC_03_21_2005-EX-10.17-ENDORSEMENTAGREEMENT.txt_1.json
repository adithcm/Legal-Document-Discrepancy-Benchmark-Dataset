        "section": "If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****].",
        "explanation": "This section creates an internal contradiction. It states that if the consultant participates in photo shoots they need to wear Adams Golf items, but then notes that the consultant can endorse another product, but cannot have that logo on the Adams Golf items. It contradicts itself, because the consultant is using Adams Golf products, but endorsing another company's products, which can still be seen, which would make viewers believe that Watson prefers their items.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph has some ambiguity in text. The section states that if the consultant dies, that Adams Golf can terminate the agreement, and that the consultant or consultant's estate, will repay Adams Golf for the period of the agreement not performed. However, this would be impossible, as death makes it impossible for one to complete something. This should not require the consultant's estate to repay the company.",

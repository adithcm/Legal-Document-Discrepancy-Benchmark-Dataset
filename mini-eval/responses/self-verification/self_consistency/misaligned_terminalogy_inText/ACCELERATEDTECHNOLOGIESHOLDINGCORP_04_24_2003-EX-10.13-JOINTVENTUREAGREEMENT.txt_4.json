        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Participant shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Investor shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "The terms \"Joint Venturers\", \"Participant\", and \"Investor\" are used seemingly interchangeably within the same paragraph. This lack of clear definition creates confusion as to who is being referred to and whether the stipulations apply equally to both parties. It is not clear if \"Participant\" and \"Investor\" are explicitly referring to the Joint Venturers or additional parties. This could lead to disputes over reimbursement of expenses or entitlement to compensation.",

        "explanation": "This section contains multiple misalignments in terminology. It refers to \"Goods\", \"Partnership\", \"Syndicate\", and \"Owner\" without defining them or establishing their relationship to the Joint Venture or the Products. The use of \"Partnership\" and \"Syndicate\" is especially problematic because the agreement explicitly states the intention to form a joint venture, not a partnership.",

        "explanation": "The term states that the contract will terminate unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination. This statement is structurally flawed and does not make sense. It is difficult to understand the condition in the statement and what it is requiring from each party.",

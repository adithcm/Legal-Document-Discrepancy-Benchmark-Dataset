        "explanation": "The Recitals section introduces both \"Deliverables\" and \"Services\". However, only \"Services\" is consistently used and defined throughout the rest of the document. The term \"Deliverables\" is not used again, creating confusion as to whether it is distinct from, or a subset of, \"Services\".",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"historical provision of the Services and with the same standard of care as historically provided\" is vague because it's not clear what the \"historical provision\" and \"standard of care\" actually were.

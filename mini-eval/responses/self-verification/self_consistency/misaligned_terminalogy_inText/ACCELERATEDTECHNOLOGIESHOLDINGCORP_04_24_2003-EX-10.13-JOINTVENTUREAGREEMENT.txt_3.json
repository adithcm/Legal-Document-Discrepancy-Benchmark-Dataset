        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section provides no guidelines or requirements as to how the \"mutual consent\" should occur. There's no clause outlining a formal procedure, like a written agreement or a specific voting threshold, for reaching mutual consent. This omission creates a loophole, as disagreements could arise about whether mutual consent was genuinely obtained, leading to potential disputes.",

        "section": "The Founders shall maintain adequate books and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The use of the term \"Founders\" in this context is ambiguous. The agreement begins by defining the parties as \"Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. ('CCGI') and Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. ('PVSS'), (the 'Parties' or 'Joint Venturers' if referred to collectively, or the 'Entity' if referred to singularly)\". The sudden shift to \"Founders\" without defining it creates confusion about who is responsible for maintaining the books and records.",

Depreciation and all other charges and expenses, which are not expressly apportioned by this Agreement, shall be apportioned in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.",
        "explanation": "The contract addresses the distribution of income, credits, losses, and deductions. It also mentions depreciation and other unapportioned charges being handled according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The phrase 'not expressly apportioned by this Agreement' introduces ambiguity. There is no section which provides information or details about what is considered expressly apportioned.",

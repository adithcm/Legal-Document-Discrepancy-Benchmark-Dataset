        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The section discusses repayment based on failing to achieve a satisfactory record of play in a 'minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events'. However, it later references '[*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events' and 'each event under [*****] achieved.' The inconsistency of the number of events makes the clause ambiguous and potentially unenforceable.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the termination process due to a breach of contract. However, the requirement for the CONSULTANT to repay ADAMS GOLF upon termination for cause is not balanced. If ADAMS GOLF breaches the contract, it seems unfair for the CONSULTANT to have to repay any money. This is a structural flaw, as this section is not drafted properly.",

However, the exact meaning of the omitted words isn't clear. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes regarding the consultant's apparel obligations in specific advertising contexts.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It first states that renewal requires mutual written agreement, but then it says the agreement will be automatically renewed if neither party gives notice of non-renewal. This creates confusion about the actual requirements for renewal.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of the indemnity clause includes a significant limitation: that the 'Protected Party' is considered a 'key agent of the Guarantor'. This is ambiguous. If the Protected Party is not a key agent of the Guarantor, does the indemnity still apply? This is incongruent with the rest of the section, which specifies 2TheMart indemnifying i-Escrow for grievances derived from 2TheMart Material and i-Escrow indemnifying 2TheMart for grievances arising from i-Escrow Material. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes over the scope of the indemnity.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The process used to calculate how much i-Escrow has to pay 2TheMart may prove to be ambiguous and unenforceable. Since the contract does not detail how a customer engagement is defined, what counts as median revenue, and how and when these numbers are calculated. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the amount owed.",

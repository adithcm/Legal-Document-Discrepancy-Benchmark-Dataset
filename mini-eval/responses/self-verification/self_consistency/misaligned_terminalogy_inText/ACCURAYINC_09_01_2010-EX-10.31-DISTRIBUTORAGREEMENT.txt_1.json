        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section regarding supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery contains conflicting information. It states that Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, but then gives an example where if the purchase order was June 1 with a delivery date of December 1, Accuray will bear the costs of shipping. The example date provided is exactly six months, not at least six months, which contradicts the original statement.",

For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "In Section 3.6, it states that Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date. However, Section 4.1.2 states that if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray. This implies that a delivery date of exactly six months after the purchase order is accepted, contradicting the 'at least' six months requirement from Section 3.6.",

Payment for the purchase of a System shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars in the form of either (1) an irrevocable trade finance letter of credit or (2) wire transfer as further described in Sections 5.4.1.1 (Letter of Credit) and 5.4.1.2 (Wire Transfer), respectively below. Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "The section on past due balances for System Purchase Payments adds a condition for when payment is deemed past due if the Distributor is a 'business person' as defined by German law. This introduces ambiguity because it's unclear whether this condition applies to all Distributors or only those classified as 'business persons' under German law. This creates uncertainty regarding when interest charges would apply for different Distributors, which may lead to payment disputes.",

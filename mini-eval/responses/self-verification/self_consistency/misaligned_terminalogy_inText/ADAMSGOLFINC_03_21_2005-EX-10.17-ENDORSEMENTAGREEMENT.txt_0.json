The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "Section 4 grants CONSULTANT the right to endorse another product, the terms of the agreement are vauge and not properly explained. The redacted portions make it difficult to understand the exact scope and limitations of this exception, creating a potential ambiguity about the extent to which the consultant can endorse competing products. The level of redaction makes it hard to know the rules of the endorsement.",

        "explanation": "The indemnity clause places a blanket obligation on the CONSULTANT to indemnify ADAMS GOLF for any liability arising from the consultant's breach of the agreement. This is a discrepancy because some breaches may be minor or inconsequential. Placing the entire burden on the CONSULTANT regardless of fault is contradiction within the legal terms.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause creates a discrepancy. In the event of the consultant's death, the estate is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the period of the agreement not performed. This is a legal contradiction. Requiring the estate to repay compensation already paid is not clearly defined, especially considering the base compensation might be considered payment for the endorsement rights, regardless of the number of tournaments played. Also, the 'inability to play tour golf at all' is ambiguous.",

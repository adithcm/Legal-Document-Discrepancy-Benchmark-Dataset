        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray. ",
        "explanation": "This section states that failure to approve or disapprove a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval, but it also says a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This is a discrepancy because it is not clear if approving a purchase order can only be done by authorized personnel executing it or if there is another form of approval.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency. It states that Accuray bears expedited delivery costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the example illustrates a scenario where a Purchase Order submitted on June 1 with a delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months later) results in Accuray bearing the expedited costs. This contradicts the 'at least six months' condition, creating ambiguity.",

        "section": "9.2. Third Party Claims. If Distributor promptly notifies Accuray of a claim it has received or of which it becomes aware that the Products or any part thereof purchased by Distributor hereunder infringes a third party's proprietary rights, then Accuray agrees, at its discretion, either to (i) defend the claim at its expense, with the cooperation of Distributor, provided, that Accuray shall reimburse Distributor for any reasonable costs or expenses actually incurred by Distributor in connection with providing such cooperation, or (ii) make changes in the Product or part thereof so that they are at least functionally equivalent and non-infringing or replace the Products with alternatives that are at least functionally equivalent to avoid the claim, or (iii) purchase the right to use such proprietary right or (iv) refund to the purchaser the net book value of the Product less a reasonable deduction for use, wear and tear, and depreciation upon Accuray taking possession of such Product. Notwithstanding Section 10.1, the foregoing states the entire liability of Accuray with respect to infringement of patents or other proprietary rights by the Products or part thereof, or by their operation. ",
        "explanation": "There is an in-text contradiction due to the cross-reference to Section 10.1. Section 9.2 states that the measures listed (defend the claim, make changes to the product, purchase the right to use the proprietary right, or refund the purchase) constitute Accuray's entire liability regarding infringement claims, 'notwithstanding Section 10.1'. However, Section 10.1 is Accuray's Indemnity clause, which also addresses third-party claims related to patent or copyright infringement. By stating that Section 9.2 is the entire liability 'notwithstanding Section 10.1,' the contract creates an inconsistency because both sections cover similar subject matter (infringement claims), but Section 9.2 attempts to supersede the provisions of Section 10.1 without clearly defining the extent or limitations of this supersedence.",

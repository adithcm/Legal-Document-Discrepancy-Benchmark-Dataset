        "section": "1.2 Standard of Service. (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section requires Provider Representatives to be dedicated solely to providing Services to Recipient and not provide any services to Provider or other customers. However, Section 1.2(e) allows Provider to use subcontractors to perform the Services. If the subcontractors are not considered Provider Representatives, then they would not be subject to the restriction of solely providing services to Recipient. This creates a potential loophole where Provider could use subcontractors to provide services to other customers, effectively circumventing the restriction on Provider Representatives.",

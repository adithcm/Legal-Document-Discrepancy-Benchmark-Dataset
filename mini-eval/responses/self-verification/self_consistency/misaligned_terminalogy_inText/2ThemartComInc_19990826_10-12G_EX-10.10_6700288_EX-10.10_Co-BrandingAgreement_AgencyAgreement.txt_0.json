        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then it also states that the agreement will be automatically renewed for another year if neither party provides notice of non-renewal. These two statements contradict each other because they describe two different ways to renew the agreement.",

Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor\" creates ambiguity. Standard indemnity clauses do not typically require the protected party to be considered a key agent of the guarantor. This condition significantly limits the scope of the indemnity and introduces uncertainty about when the indemnity obligation is triggered. It is unclear what constitutes a 'key agent' and how that determination is made.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that the revised pricing will be attached as an exhibit, but there is no exhibit showing this pricing. Since the amount owed relies on this price, it would be hard to calculate how much is actually owed.",

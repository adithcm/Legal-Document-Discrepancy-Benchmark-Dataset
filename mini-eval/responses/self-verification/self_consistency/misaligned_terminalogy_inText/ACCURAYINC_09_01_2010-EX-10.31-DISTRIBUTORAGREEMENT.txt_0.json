        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction in the allocation of expedited shipping costs. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission, Accuray bears the expedited costs. However, the subsequent example contradicts this by stating that if a purchase order is submitted on June 1 with a delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months later), Accuray bears the costs. This creates confusion about whether a delivery date exactly six months after submission qualifies for Accuray to bear expedited costs.",

        "section": "3.6. Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "Section 3.6 states that for each sale, the distributor needs to send a purchase order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. This contradicts Section 4.1.2 which states As of the Effective Time and to the best of Accuray's knowledge, Accuray's standard lead time for delivery of Products is six months. Section 3.6 says 'at least' and Section 4.1.2 says delivery is six months. This means there is no room to work with to ship out these items and makes the language confusing.",

        "section": "Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor",
        "explanation": "In the first sentence of Section 10.1, there is ambiguity in legal terms. Specifically, the phrase \"infringes any patent issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret\" is vague. The ambiguity lies in whether the \"or\" connecting \"copyright\" and \"misappropriates any trade secret\" is meant to be inclusive or exclusive. If inclusive, Accuray is obligated to defend against claims involving patent infringement in specified locations, copyright infringement anywhere, or trade secret misappropriation. If exclusive, it implies a requirement that any claim must simultaneously involve infringement of a patent in those locations, and copyright infringement, and trade secret misappropriation, which is illogical and unlikely. This ambiguity makes the obligation unclear and subject to multiple interpretations, creating a legal contradiction.",

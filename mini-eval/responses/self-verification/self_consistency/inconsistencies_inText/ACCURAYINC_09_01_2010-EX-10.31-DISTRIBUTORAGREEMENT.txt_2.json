        "section": "All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph discusses who bears supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery. It states Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the example provided contradicts this, as it describes a Purchase Order submitted on June 1 with a delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months later). It should be more than six months to avoid a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The section mentions that the distributor shall receive credit for sales if accuray contracts directly with a customer after not approving a quote, but it refers to section 3.4 of the strategic alliance agreement. Looking at the document, there are no specific details of how the credit is applied to the distributor for a sale. This can create misinterpretation.",

        "explanation": "This section discusses discounts on Products/Spare parts/Service agreements. However, when looking at Exhibit A, it states 'Siemens Bundled Sales Price= (List Price (1- (Volume Discount + Distributor Discount))' which does not explicitly state how the distributor receives a commission in the amount specified in Exhibit A.

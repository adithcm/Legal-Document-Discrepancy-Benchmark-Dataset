        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that Provider Representatives must dedicate themselves solely to Recipient, which is inconsistent with the general understanding that Provider is an independent contractor (Section 1.2(d)). Independent contractors typically serve multiple clients. This requirement could blur the lines between an independent contractor and an employee, potentially creating legal issues regarding employment classification and benefits.",

        "explanation": "While choice of law clauses are common, the breadth of this clause is problematic.  It states that even claims arising in tort or equity are governed by Israeli law, regardless of where the tort occurred or where the equitable claim arose. This could be unenforceable if it violates fundamental public policy of the jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.",

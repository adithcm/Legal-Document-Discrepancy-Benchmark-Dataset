The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****].

The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section allows the consultant to endorse another product ([*****]) despite the exclusivity clause in 4A, 4B, and 4C. However, it is unclear what actions the CONSULTANT would take to remedy the situation if the use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals. There is not enough information to know what this means.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph states that in the event that the consultant dies, ADAMS GOLF may terminate the agreement. It then states that upon termination, the consultant's estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. However, the next sentence states that no repayment shall be required if the failure to play is due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event. Death is not caused by an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, it's death. There is a contradiction of when the consultant's estate should repay ADAMS GOLF.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the conditions under which either party can terminate the agreement for cause and the subsequent repayment obligations. However, the phrase \"material breach\" is ambiguous. A material breach is not specifically defined in this contract. What constitutes a material breach is open to interpretation, potentially leading to disputes.",

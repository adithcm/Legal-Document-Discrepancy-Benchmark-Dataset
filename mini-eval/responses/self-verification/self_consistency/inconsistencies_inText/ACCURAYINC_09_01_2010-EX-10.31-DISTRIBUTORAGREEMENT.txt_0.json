        "section": "Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 1.0% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and potential contradiction regarding when interest accrues on past due balances. It first states interest accrues on any reasonably undisputed amount past due, then qualifies this by stating that for a 'business person' under German law, payment is only past due after a payment demand note is received. This creates uncertainty as to whether interest starts accruing immediately after the due date for all entities, or only after a demand note for entities defined as 'business persons' under German law. This could lead to disputes over the timing and calculation of interest charges.",

No such software shall be copied or decompiled in whole or in part by Distributor or Customer, and Distributor or Customer shall not disclose or provide any such software, or any portion thereof, to any third party.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a structural flaw. It begins by granting a right to use the software to both Distributor and Customer, but then proceeds to restrict the actions of both Distributor and Customer, creating a disconnect. The language implies that the restrictions apply equally to both parties, even though their roles and responsibilities regarding the software may differ significantly. The structure is not logical.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a structural flaw and doesn't make sense. The first sentence states that each party should not delay notification to the other party about any claim. The second sentence states that nothing in this section should waive any party's right to seek an injunction. The second sentence does not follow the first, making the language flawed.",

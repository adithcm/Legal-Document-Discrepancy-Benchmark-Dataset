        "section": "Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "This section states that a failure to respond to a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. This is an example of ambiguity in text because it is not clear if this is two weeks from the date the Purchase Order was sent or received by Accuray. This could cause confusion about the actual deadline and creates an internal contradiction.",

        "section": "For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.  4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This discrepancy occurs because there are conflicting statements regarding who bears the cost of expedited delivery. Section 3.6 states that the Purchase Order must be sent at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. Then Section 4.1.2 states that Accuray will bear the cost of expedited delivery if the delivery date is at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order. There is an inconsistency because there is no coverage on what happens if the Purchase Order is not sent six months prior to the expected shipment date.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding Section 5.4.3 above, Distributor shall be solely responsible for determining the creditworthiness of and collecting payment from its Customers. The risk of non-collection from the Customer will be borne entirely by Distributor, which shall be responsible for making timely payment to Accuray for Products whether or not Distributor is successful in collecting from its Customer. In the event that full payment is not received by Accuray, Accuray shall not be liable to Distributor for any margin or commission unless and until it has received payment of amounts sufficient to cover the costs incurred by Accuray to provide the applicable Products to Distributor and the applicable Services to Customer (\"Accuray Cost\"). Distributor acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled to receive payment of any margin or commission until Accuray has received payment of the Accuray Cost amount in relation to the applicable Products and Services.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses payment responsibilities and margins/commissions. It contains a structural flaw because it is not easy to follow and understand the payment responsibilities and what is owed to each party. The way it is structured does not make sense and needs to be re-written.",

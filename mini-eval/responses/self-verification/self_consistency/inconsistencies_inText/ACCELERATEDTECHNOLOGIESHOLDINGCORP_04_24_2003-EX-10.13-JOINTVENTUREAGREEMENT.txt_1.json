        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, Section 9 later mentions that no interest shall be allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. This implies that there *could* be contributions, creating an in-text contradiction. The initial statement implies no requirement for contributions, but the later statement accepts the possibility of contributions. This creates ambiguity.",

        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses distributions. It first states that distributions are only allowed if the Joint Venture's assets exceed its liabilities and will be distributed based on prorata interest. However, it then provides an exception: PVSS is entitled to a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month 'regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.' This creates a contradiction. If the Joint Venture has insufficient assets to cover its liabilities after the guaranteed payment to PVSS, the guaranteed payment contradicts the preceding rule that distributions can only be made if assets exceed liabilities. It also creates ambiguity in how the guaranteed payment affects the 'prorata' distributions, or if the Joint Venture is not profitable, this payment would not be prorated.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the procedure for termination and liquidation, stating that assets will be distributed according to prorata ownership. However, a later clause gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. ('CCGI') the final say on asset valuation in case of a dispute. This creates a potential in-text contradiction. If CCGI undervalues an asset, the distribution would not be truly prorata because CCGI could essentially acquire a larger share of the assets by dictating a lower valuation. The phrase 'satisfactory to the Joint Venturers' also can be considered ambiguious.",

        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, Section 9 states that no Joint Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any part of his capital contribution or account, implying that a capital contribution exists or could exist. This creates an in-text contradiction because the document doesn't specify how a capital contribution would be made if it's not required.",

Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction. It first states that distributions can only be made if the Joint Venture's assets exceed its liabilities. Then, it states that PVSS is entitled to a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of profitability. This contradicts the previous statement, as the guaranteed payment could be made even when liabilities exceed assets, thereby violating the initial distribution rule.",

        "explanation": "This gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. the final say in asset valuation during liquidation. This can lead to unfair distribution. All assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. Section 6 States that  50% goes to Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. and 50% goes to Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. If Collectible Concepts Group, Inc has the final say, then they can undervalue the assets so that they don't have to distribute it evenly.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section allows the consultant to endorse other products, specifically the [*****], which contradicts the exclusivity clause in sections 4A, 4B, and 4C. While it attempts to define the conditions under which this is permissible (consistent with past advertising practice), the redactions make it impossible to fully understand the scope and limitations of this exception. This creates ambiguity and potential for dispute regarding what constitutes permissible endorsement activity.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates a minimum number of events the consultant must participate in and a repayment schedule if this minimum isn't met. However, the redactions of the minimum number of events and the repayment amounts make it impossible to determine the actual contractual obligation and financial implications. The term 'satisfactory record of play' is also ambiguous and undefined, leading to potential disputes over what constitutes a qualifying event and whether the consultant's performance was 'satisfactory'.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination due to the consultant's inability to play. It states that if the inability is due to an injury sustained at an Adams Golf event, no repayment is required. However, it then states that upon termination, the consultant's estate *shall* repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period, calculated as in section 8A. This creates an inconsistency: is repayment required if the inability is due to an Adams Golf-related injury, or not? The wording suggests both possibilities.",

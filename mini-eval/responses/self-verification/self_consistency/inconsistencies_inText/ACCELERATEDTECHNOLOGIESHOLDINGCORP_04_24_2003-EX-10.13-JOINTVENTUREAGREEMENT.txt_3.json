        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous. While it says capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon, it doesn't specify what happens if contributions *are* mutually agreed upon. What form do these contributions take? Are there limits? Without further clarification, this clause could lead to disputes.",

    {
        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction. The first part states distributions can only occur if assets exceed liabilities and must be proportional to ownership interests (Section 6). However, the last sentence mandates a guaranteed $10,000 monthly payment to PVSS irrespective of profitability, which could violate the condition that assets exceed liabilities after the distribution, and would inherently be disproportionate to ownership if the venture isn't profitable enough to cover the payment from profits.",

        "section": "Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the procedure for asset distribution upon termination. It stipulates that if an asset cannot be divided, the parties should agree on a price. However, it then grants Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. the final say on the asset's value in case of a dispute. This contradicts the initial requirement for mutual agreement, potentially allowing CCGI to undervalue assets and disadvantage PVSS during liquidation, thus violating the principle of prorata distribution.",

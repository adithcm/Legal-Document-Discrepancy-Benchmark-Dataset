        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement implies that capital contributions are generally not required, but leaves room for them if both parties agree. However, it doesn't specify what happens if the Joint Venture needs capital and the parties *don't* mutually consent. This creates an ambiguity regarding funding in such a scenario.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This clause introduces a contradiction regarding the distributions of the Joint Venture. Prior to this sentence, the document states that distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Meaning that distributions cannot happen until all liabilities are paid. However, it also states that PVSS will receive a guaranteed payment regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability, meaning that they will be paid even if there is not enough money to distribute.",

        "explanation": "This statement creates a structural flaw in the legal terms because it gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. the final say on asset valuation during liquidation without specifying the criteria or process for that valuation. This lacks a fair and impartial method of asset valuation, which could lead to disputes and unfair outcomes for Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. during liquidation.",

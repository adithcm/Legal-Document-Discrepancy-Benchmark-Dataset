        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section grants 2TheMart the unilateral right to adjust the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow. This creates a discrepancy because it allows 2TheMart to change a key financial term of the contract without i-Escrow's consent, potentially leading to unpredictable and unfair costs for i-Escrow. Such a clause could be challenged as unconscionable.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "There is conflicting information about the renewal of the terms of the agreement. At first, it says the agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. Then, it says In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the survival of certain provisions upon termination. It states that all rights terminate upon expiration or termination, but then carves out an exception for provisions necessary to complete pending customer transactions. However, it then states that sections 1, 7, 8.5, 9, 10, 11, and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement. Section 8.5 directly contradicts itself because it states that the section does not survive expiration or termination of this agreement, but later says all provisions of the agreement survive.",

The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section grants the consultant the right to endorse and play the [*****] product, which seems to contradict the exclusivity clauses in paragraphs 4A, 4B, and 4C. While it attempts to define the extent of this exception, the numerous redactions ([*****]) create ambiguity and make it difficult to determine the exact nature and limitations of this permitted endorsement. This introduces an in-text contradiction as the general exclusivity is undermined by an ill-defined exception.",

        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification.",
        "explanation": "Section 8A states the consultant must achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum number of events. However, that number of events is redacted, and the number of events used in the subsequent sentence is also redacted. This creates ambiguity regarding the minimum requirement. While the repayment schedule addresses the consequences of not meeting the minimum, the lack of clarity on what constitutes a 'satisfactory record' and the redacted number of events lead to an in-text contradiction. It becomes impossible to enforce the repayment clause without knowing the specific number of events required.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination due to the consultant's inability to play golf. It initially states that no repayment is required if the inability is due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event. However, the subsequent sentence states that upon such termination, the consultant or their estate *shall* be required to repay Adams Golf for the unperformed portion of the agreement, contradicting the previous statement. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the repayment obligation in the event of termination due to injury during a promotional event.",

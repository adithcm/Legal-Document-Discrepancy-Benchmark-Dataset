        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction regarding the renewal of the agreement. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then continues to say that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. These two sentences contradict each other as it makes it unclear how to renew the agreement. Does it require a mutual agreement in writing, or will it automatically renew unless notice is given?",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The section grants 2TheMart the unilateral right to adjust the advertising fees without i-Escrow's consent. This could be deemed unconscionable if the adjusted rate is unreasonable or excessive, potentially violating general contract law principles of fairness and good faith.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party\" is ambiguous and could significantly limit the scope of indemnification. Indemnification clauses typically cover a broader range of liabilities, and this limitation could create disputes over whether the indemnifying party's actions fall within the scope of 'principal' relationship. The lack of clarity makes the responsibility of who is liable very unclear.",

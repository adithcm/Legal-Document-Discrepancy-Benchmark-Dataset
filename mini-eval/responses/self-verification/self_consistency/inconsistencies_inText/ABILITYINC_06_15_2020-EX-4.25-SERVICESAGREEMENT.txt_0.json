        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and doesn't make sense. It includes the word 'Agreement' twice and lacks proper grammar, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning of the contract's effective period and termination date. The intended meaning is that the agreement is effective as of the effective date and terminates on December 31, 2020.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters.' This section details how Provider will be paid by the Recipient, including costs and service fees. It is a contradiction to state that Section 2.2 survives termination, as it implies that payment terms continue after the agreement ends. This is contradictory because usually the payment terms are only valid during the active term of the agreement and not after termination.",

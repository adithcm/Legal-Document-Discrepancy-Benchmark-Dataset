        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence contradicts the previous statements about renewal. It states that if neither party provides notice, the agreement is automatically renewed. However, the first part of the paragraph specifies that renewal requires a mutual written agreement. The automatic renewal clause negates the need for mutual agreement and creates conflicting conditions for renewal.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow without requiring i-Escrow's consent. This could be argued as unconscionable depending on applicable state laws regarding fair dealing and good faith, particularly if the adjustments are excessive or made in bad faith. The immediate effectiveness of the adjusted rate, without any negotiation or recourse for i-Escrow, further exacerbates this issue. Depending on the jurisdiction, this clause might be deemed unenforceable or require a showing of reasonableness and good faith.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph creates an internal contradiction. It states that Section 8.5 does not survive termination, but also states that 'all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions'. Because the details of what happens upon termination are contained in section 8.5, it is unclear whether these details survive termination or not. This could cause issues during the termination process.",

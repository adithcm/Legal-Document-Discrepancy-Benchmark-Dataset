Notwithstanding the contents of the Exhibit, Provider agrees to respond in good faith to any reasonable request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, at a price to be agreed upon after good faith negotiations between the Parties. Any such additional services and resources so provided by Provider shall constitute Services under this Agreement and be subject in all respect to the provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on the Exhibit as of the date hereof.",
        "explanation": "This section refers to Exhibit A for the services provided. However, it also states that additional services requested by the Recipient will also constitute Services under the agreement. It does not explicitly state how these additional services will be added to Exhibit A, leading to potential ambiguity. If the additional services are 'subject in all respect to the provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on the Exhibit as of the date hereof' how will the exhibit be updated to reflect the addition?",

        "explanation": "This clause prohibits Provider Representatives from providing services to the Provider or any other customer. This restriction could be overly broad and potentially unenforceable if it unduly restricts the Provider Representatives' ability to seek alternative employment after the agreement terminates. Depending on jurisdiction, non-compete clauses need to be reasonable in scope and duration.",

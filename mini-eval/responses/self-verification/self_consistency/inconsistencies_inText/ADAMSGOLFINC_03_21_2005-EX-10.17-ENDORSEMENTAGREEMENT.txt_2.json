        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section provides an exception to the exclusivity clause, allowing the Consultant to endorse another product ([*****]). However, the vague language regarding the consistency with past advertising practices and the consultant's obligation to 'remedy the situation' if it varies creates ambiguity. The terms like \"similarly situated professionals\" and \"remedy the situation\" are not clearly defined, potentially leading to disputes.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory. It first states that upon termination due to death or inability to play, repayment is required for the unperformed period of the agreement. However, it also includes a caveat that if the inability to play is due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment is required. This creates an inconsistency as the first sentence implies repayment is always necessary upon termination under those circumstances, while the second carves out an exception.",

        "explanation": "The structure of this paragraph is confusing. The document discusses SAG and AFTRA but then pivots to say \u201cor any other organization having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT\u2019S services hereunder\u201d. Because this agreement covers services related to sports, it is unlikely that SAG or AFTRA, which are unions related to acting, would have jurisdiction over Consultant\u2019s services. This creates a structural flaw.",

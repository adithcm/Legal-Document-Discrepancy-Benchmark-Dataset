        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "Section 4 explicitly restricts Consultant from endorsing competing products, yet this section allows endorsement of [*****] with specific conditions. While seemingly an exception, the extensive redactions ([*****]) throughout make the scope and limitations of this exception unclear, creating ambiguity and potential for dispute. It's uncertain what 'consistent with past advertising practice' entails, and what actions Consultant must take to 'remedy the situation' if the use varies.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows: The agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year",
        "explanation": "The language regarding the minimum number of tournaments and repayment is inconsistent. It states a minimum number of events ([*****]) but refers to 'satisfactory record of play.' The term 'satisfactory record of play' is vague and undefined. Furthermore, the consequences of not achieving a 'satisfactory record' versus not playing enough events are not clearly distinguished. This creates ambiguity in determining when repayment is triggered.",

However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section details termination conditions if the consultant is unable to play tour golf. However, the statement, 'Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT' contradicts the statement in the first half of the section, 'However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required.' Both statements cannot be true and it is not specified which statement trumps the other.",

        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This clause creates ambiguity. While Provider agrees to provide the services in Exhibit A, they are not obligated to provide 'additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient' if not in Exhibit A, unless they deem it fit and feasible. The term 'necessary' is vague and subjective. It's unclear what constitutes 'necessary' services and who determines necessity. This could lead to disputes if Recipient believes certain services are necessary for their operation but are not explicitly listed in Exhibit A, and Provider refuses to provide them.",

        "explanation": "The sentence structure is flawed and grammatically incorrect. It includes \"Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement\" which doesn't make sense. This makes the intended meaning unclear.",

        "explanation": "This section states that Recipient shall own all rights to intellectual property conceived by Provider, but only 'if both parties agree it is related to the services'. This introduces a condition precedent that gives Provider veto power over whether the Recipient owns the IP. This contradicts the general principle that works created during the performance of services contracted by the Recipient should belong to the Recipient.",

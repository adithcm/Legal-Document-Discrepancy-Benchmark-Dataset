        "explanation": "This section creates an exception to the exclusivity clauses (4A, 4B, 4C), but the exception is vaguely defined. The lack of clarity around what kind of ads allows for potential loopholes and disputes over whether a specific ad falls under the exception. The terms are interchanged without them being properly defined.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The term \"satisfactory record of play\" is not defined, creating ambiguity. This could lead to disagreements on whether the consultant met the requirement of playing in a minimum number of events due to this term not being defined properly. The meaning is vague and is subject to interpretation.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination due to the consultant's inability to play and requires repayment calculated as in paragraph 8A. However, paragraph 8A outlines repayment for failing to meet a minimum number of tournaments, not for total inability to play. This creates a contradiction as the calculation method in 8A may not be appropriate or applicable for the scenario described in section 22. A key contractual clause is removed and other sections still reference it, creating an internal contradiction.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the third-party mediator shall determine the fair price and decide which party receives the asset, potentially offsetting balances to ensure fair distribution, as determined by the mediator.",
        "explanation": "This section contradicts itself by first stating that debts will be paid in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the Joint Venturers satisfaction. It then states that unexpended funds shall be distributed according to their pro rata ownership. But then says that all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. This is a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section is an omission in text. It mentions that either joint venturer providing notice of extension is enough to extend the agreement. However, it fails to provide the rules and guidelines in terms of the deadline of the notice. ",

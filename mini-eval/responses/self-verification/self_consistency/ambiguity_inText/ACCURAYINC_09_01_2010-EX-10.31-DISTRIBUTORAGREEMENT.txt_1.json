        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section has an inconsistency in who bears the expedited delivery expenses. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission, Accuray bears the cost. However, the subsequent example contradicts this by stating that if the requested delivery date is less than six months (October 1 in the example), Distributor bears the expedited costs. However, the general statement says 'any supplementary shipping costs' which implies all shipping costs are borne by Accuray if they are late. This implies the distributor only pays shipping if they want it expedited faster than the 6 month lead time. The example implies even if the company is late, the distributor still pays.",

        "section": "3.6. Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section requires the Distributor to send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. However, Section 4.1.2 states that Accuray's standard lead time for delivery of Products is six months. This creates an in-text contradiction, because it's impossible to fulfill the purchase order in time, since the purchase order would arrive exactly when the product is supposed to ship.",

        "section": "10.1. Accuray Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency within Accuray's obligations for indemnity, specifically regarding expenses. In subsection (iii), it states Accuray will receive information, assistance, and authority 'at Accuray's expense'. This contradicts the overarching statement that Accuray will indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from 'any liability, damages, and expenses', as this should already include the expenses incurred from providing Accuray with the required information, assistance, and authority. It is also a structural flaw to mention Accuray's expenses here in subsection (iii), when it should be implied under the overall indemnity.",

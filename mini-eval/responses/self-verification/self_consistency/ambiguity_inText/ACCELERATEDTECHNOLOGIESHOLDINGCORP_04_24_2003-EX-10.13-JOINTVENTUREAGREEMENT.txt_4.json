        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous. While it states that no capital contribution is required unless mutually agreed upon, it doesn't specify what happens if capital contributions are needed later on and the venturers can't reach a mutual agreement. This could lead to disputes if additional funding is necessary for the Joint Venture's operations.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the third-party mediator shall determine the fair price and decide which party receives the asset, potentially offsetting balances to ensure fair distribution, as determined by the mediator.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction in the procedure on termination and liquidation. It states that unexpended funds are distributed based on prorata ownership but then states all other assets shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. This is a contradiction. The distribution of 'all other assets' being based on the discretion of the mediator contradicts the initial principle of prorata ownership.",

        "explanation": "The language regarding extension is vague and potentially contradictory. It states 'unless extended by either joint venturer providing notice of extension,' implying a unilateral right to extend. However, it is commonly understood in joint ventures that extensions require mutual agreement. The lack of clarity on whether both parties must agree for an extension introduces ambiguity and a potential source of disagreement.",

        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity regarding the Provider's obligation to provide services. While the first sentence states that the Provider agrees to provide services as set forth in Exhibit A, the second sentence introduces a caveat that the Provider is not obligated to respond to requests for additional services not contemplated in Exhibit A, unless it deems it fit and feasible. This creates uncertainty as to what services the Provider is definitively obligated to provide, leading to potential disputes over the scope of the agreement.",

        "explanation": "There's a structural flaw in the sentence. The sentence doesn't seem to make sense. It should read 'This Agreement shall be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.'",

Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, \"Losses\"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "This section includes a contradictory element. The clause specifies indemnification against losses arising from claims of a 'third party or Recipient'. Generally, indemnification clauses protect against third-party claims, not claims made by the indemnified party (Recipient) against the indemnifying party (Provider). Indemnification typically doesn't cover direct claims between the parties to the agreement. This inclusion expands the scope of indemnification beyond the norm and introduces a potential ambiguity in its application.",

        "section": "14. INDEMNITY CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction. The first sentence states that the Consultant is responsible for indemnifying Adams Golf for all expenses, *excluding* attorney's fees. However, the second sentence states that Adams Golf *will* cover the Consultant's attorney fees up to $10,000 in this same scenario. This contradicts the initial exclusion.",

        "section": "8. MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous because it uses vague language such as \"satisfactory record of play.\" The contract never defines what constitutes a \"satisfactory record of play,\" making it unclear when the repayment clause is triggered. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether the Consultant has met the minimum requirements.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This creates a potentially unconscionable outcome. If the consultant dies or is permanently disabled, his estate is required to repay Adams Golf for the unperformed period of the agreement. This seems inherently unfair as the inability to perform is due to circumstances entirely beyond the consultant's control. Especially considering the reference to 8A is to a schedule for *underperformance*, not complete lack of ability to perform. It is unusual to enforce repayment for an event such as death or permanent disability.",

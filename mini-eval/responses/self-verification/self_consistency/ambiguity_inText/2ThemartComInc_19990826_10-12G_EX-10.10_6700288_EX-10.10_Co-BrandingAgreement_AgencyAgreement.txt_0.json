This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The repetition of the sentence 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.' creates a structural flaw and doesn't add any legal or contextual information to the text.",

Notice shall be deemed given: only upon personal delivery; if sent by fax, only if acknowledged by phone; or if sent by a reputable overnight courier with tracking capabilities, only three (3) days after the date of mailing: To i-Escrow: i-Escrow, Inc. 1730 South Amphlett Blvd., #215 San Mateo, CA 94402 Fax no.

Magliarditi President 18301 Von Karman Avenue, 7th Floor Irvine, CA 92612 Fax no. (949) 477-1221",
        "explanation": "The notice section states that for overnight courier, notice is deemed given three days after the date of mailing. This is misaligned with standard legal practice, as notice via overnight courier is typically deemed effective upon delivery or at most one business day after sending, not three days. This discrepancy could cause confusion and potential legal disputes regarding timelines and deadlines.",

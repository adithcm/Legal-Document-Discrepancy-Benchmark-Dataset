        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The section regarding renewal contains a duplicate sentence: \"A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.\" This repetition doesn't introduce a direct contradiction but is a structural flaw that affects the clarity and professionalism of the document.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of the indemnity clause limits indemnity to situations where the Indemnified Party is deemed a \"principal\" of the Indemnifying Party. This is ambiguous and significantly restricts the scope of indemnification. The subsequent sentences broaden the indemnification obligations regarding content, creating a misalignment and potential contradiction as to when and under what circumstances each party is truly indemnified. It's unclear if the 'principal' requirement applies to the subsequent sentences.",

Notice shall be deemed given: only upon personal delivery; if sent by fax, only if acknowledged by phone; or if sent by a reputable overnight courier with tracking capabilities, only three (3) days after the date of mailing:",
        "explanation": "The conditions for when a notice is deemed 'given' are inconsistent and could cause confusion. It states that for overnight courier, notice is deemed given \"only three (3) days after the date of mailing.\" This is unusual and potentially contradictory to standard legal practice where notice is often considered given upon receipt, especially with overnight courier services. If the courier delivers the notice in one day, the clause says it will not be considered given for another two days.",

        "section": "14. INDEMNITY CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an in-text contradiction. Initially, it states that the consultant is responsible for all expenses, excluding attorney's fees, but it then states Adams Golf will cover consultant's attorney's fees up to 10,000. This contradicts the first statement which excludes attorney's fees from the consultant's responsibility.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "The text implies that if the consultant dies then the consultant must repay Adams Golf for the period of the agreement not performed by the consultant. This is illogical, and would likely be unenforceable, and it could be seen as an unconscionable act.",

        "explanation": "This section is ambigious because it's not clear what would happen if there is no good faith attempt to resolve the issues.",

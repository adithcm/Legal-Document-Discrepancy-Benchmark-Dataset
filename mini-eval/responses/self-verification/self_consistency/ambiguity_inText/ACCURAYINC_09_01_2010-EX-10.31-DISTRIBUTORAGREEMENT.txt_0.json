        "explanation": "The term \"commercially reasonable efforts\" is ambiguous without a specific definition or set of criteria to determine what constitutes such efforts in the context of providing advance notice.

        "explanation": "The phrase \"other items as negotiated in good faith between the parties\" is vague and indefinite. It does not provide any objective criteria or guidelines for determining what \"other items\" should be transferred, and it relies on the subjective standard of \"good faith\" negotiation, which can be difficult to prove or enforce. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether the parties have fulfilled their obligations under this clause.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction regarding who bears the expedited shipping costs when the delivery deadline is missed. It initially states Accuray is responsible if the deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the example contradicts this by stating Accuray bears the cost for a December 1 delivery when the order was submitted on June 1 (six months prior), but the distributor bears the cost for a October 1 delivery, meaning if the deadline is less than six months after the order, the distributor bears the cost. This creates conflicting obligations and ambiguity on the actual rule.",

For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section states that for each sale, the distributor has to send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. Section 4.1.2 states, 'Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor.' It does not make sense to have the distributor send in a purchase order at least six months prior to shipment date but say Accuray will only be responsible for expedited costs if the order was submitted six months prior to delivery date.",

        "section": "9.2. Third Party Claims. If Distributor promptly notifies Accuray of a claim it has received or of which it becomes aware that the Products or any part thereof purchased by Distributor hereunder infringes a third party's proprietary rights, then Accuray agrees, at its discretion, either to (i) defend the claim at its expense, with the cooperation of Distributor, provided, that Accuray shall reimburse Distributor for any reasonable costs or expenses actually incurred by Distributor in connection with providing such cooperation, or (ii) make changes in the Product or part thereof so that they are at least functionally equivalent and non-infringing or replace the Products with alternatives that are at least functionally equivalent to avoid the claim, or (iii) purchase the right to use such proprietary right or (iv) refund to the purchaser the net book value of the Product less a reasonable deduction for use, wear and tear, and depreciation upon Accuray taking possession of such Product. Notwithstanding Section 10.1, the foregoing states the entire liability of Accuray with respect to infringement of patents or other proprietary rights by the Products or part thereof, or by their operation. To remove all doubt, Accuray has no obligation regarding any claim based on any of the following: (a) modification of the Products by any person other than Accuray; (b) combination, operation or use of the Products with other products, parts, components, materials or accessories not provided by Accuray; or (c) infringement by a product not manufactured by Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses Accuray's liability regarding third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to the Products. However, it includes a 'Notwithstanding Section 10.1' clause, which is confusing because Section 10.1 is about Accuray's indemnity obligations to the Distributor, not a limitation of Accuray's liability for infringement claims. The statement that Accuray has no obligation for claims based on certain conditions (modification, combination with other products, etc.) seems to contradict the earlier statement of Accuray's discretion to defend, change, or refund, which is confusing and creates ambiguity.",

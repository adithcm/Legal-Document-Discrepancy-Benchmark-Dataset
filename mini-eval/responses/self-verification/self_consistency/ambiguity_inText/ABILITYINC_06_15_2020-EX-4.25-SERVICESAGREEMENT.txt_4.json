        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity. The first sentence commits the Provider to deliver services in Exhibit A. The second sentence then allows the Provider to refuse additional services that are necessary for the Recipient's operation if not in the exhibit and the provider doesn't find it 'fit and feasible'. This introduces a high degree of subjectivity. It contradicts the intention of a service agreement where services should be provided with a clear scope.",

        "explanation": "This section has a structural flaw in the text that doesn't make sense. The text states \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement...\", which makes no sense, because of the repetitiveness of the word agreement. It should be reworded to make more sense.",

Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 3.1, all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section is providing contradictory and confusing information. Section 2.2 is a section on payment terms, but not all payment terms survive termination, which can be confusing. Part (e) of Section 3.6 says 'On a pro rata basis, repay all fees and expenses paid in advance for any Services which have not been provided.' This implies that the Recipient is supposed to get money back, if the agreement is terminated, but Section 2.2 is suppose to survive termination, which can be misleading.",

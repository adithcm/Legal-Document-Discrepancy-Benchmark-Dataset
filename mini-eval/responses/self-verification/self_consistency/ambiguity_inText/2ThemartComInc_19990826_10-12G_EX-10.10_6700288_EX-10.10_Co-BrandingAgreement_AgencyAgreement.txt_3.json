        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The section repeats the requirement for a party wishing to renew the agreement to provide notice 30 days before expiration. This repetition doesn't inherently create a contradiction, but it's a structural flaw that introduces redundancy and could potentially lead to confusion if one instance were later amended without the other.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the conditions under which a party may immediately terminate the agreement. However, subsection (a) states that termination is possible if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure the breach within sixty (60) days. This contradicts the initial statement that termination can be immediate. There is an in-text contradiction within the statement.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "This section includes a clause stating indemnity applies \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party\". This severely restricts the scope of indemnity, making it applicable only when the Indemnified Party is considered a principal of the Indemnifying Party.  This is not a typical or commercially reasonable indemnity provision and introduces ambiguity. Standard indemnity clauses usually cover claims arising from the Indemnifying Party's actions, not just when a principal-agent relationship is established. The legal issue here is whether this limitation unduly restricts the protection the indemnity is supposed to provide.",

        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section mandates that Provider Representatives (employees or contractors) dedicate their services solely to the Recipient. However, Section 1.1(a) states that Provider is not obligated to respond to requests for additional services not contemplated in the Exhibit unless Provider deems it 'fit and feasible'. This creates a potential conflict: If the Provider does not deem it fit and feasible they are not obligated to respond, therefore the Provider Representatives would not be solely dedicated to Recipient.",

        "explanation": "This sentence is structurally flawed and does not make sense. The phrase 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' is grammatically incorrect and unclear.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters'. By stating that this section survives termination, it implies that payment terms remain in effect even after the agreement ends. However, the agreement's purpose (provision of services) has ceased, and the basis for payment is no longer present. This creates ambiguity about what exactly Recipient is obligated to pay after termination, as there are no services being rendered.",

        "section": "If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****].",
        "explanation": "This section implies that CONSULTANT is allowed to endorse another product ([*****]), but places restrictions on how this endorsement can be visually represented, specifically prohibiting the placement of the other product's logo on ADAMS GOLF's equipment. However, it also states that if the consultant participates in a photoshoot for the other product, he shall wear ADAMS GOLF branded [*****], which is contradictory. It's unclear how the consultant is supposed to promote another brand by wearing a brand from a different company. This creates conflicting obligations about whether the consultant should promote Adams Golf or the other company during certain shoots.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an in-text contradiction regarding attorney's fees in an indemnification clause. It initially states that the consultant is responsible for all expenses, implicitly including attorney's fees, arising from a breach. However, it then states that Adams Golf will cover the consultant's attorney's fees up to $10,000, which contradicts the initial statement.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the terms of termination for cause. It specifies that if either party materially breaches the agreement, the other party can terminate after a 15-day written notice period, provided the breach is not rectified. However, the section only specifies the consequences for the consultant if this happens. It stipulates that the consultant shall be required to repay Adams Golf for the period of the agreement not performed, calculated according to paragraph 8A. It fails to describe the consequences for Adams Golf, if Adams Golf is at fault.",

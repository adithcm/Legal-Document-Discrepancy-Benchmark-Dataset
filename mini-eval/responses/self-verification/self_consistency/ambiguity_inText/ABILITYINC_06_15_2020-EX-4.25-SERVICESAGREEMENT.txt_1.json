        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction because it states the Provider agrees to provide services in Exhibit A. However, it proceeds to say that Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible. Because it first obligates the Provider to provide services, but later says that it is not obligated, this is an inconsistency in the text.",

        "explanation": "Section 3.1 states that the agreement will terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2. Section 3.2 states that the agreement can be terminated by either party at any time without cause by providing at least 90 days prior written notice. This is a contradiction because it is not clear if section 3.2 means at any time after the effective date, or at any time before December 31, 2020.",

Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, \"Losses\"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "This section contradicts itself by stating that the Provider shall indemnify the Recipient against losses arising from claims of a third party or Recipient. Indemnification typically applies to claims by third parties, not the party being indemnified. Including claims by the Recipient against the Provider within the indemnification clause is unusual and creates a potential conflict of interest, as it could incentivize the Recipient to make claims against the Provider to trigger the indemnification.",

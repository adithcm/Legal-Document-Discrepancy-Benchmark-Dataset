        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The paragraph discusses achieving a 'satisfactory record of play' but does not define what constitutes a 'satisfactory record.' This introduces ambiguity, as it's unclear what criteria are used to determine if the record of play is satisfactory. This ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce the clause, as there is no objective standard for determining whether repayment is required.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph states that upon termination for cause due to a material breach, the CONSULTANT must repay ADAMS GOLF for the period of the agreement not performed. However, it does not specify that ADAMS GOLF is required to repay the CONSULTANT if Adams Golf is in breach of contract. This creates an imbalance and potential unfairness in the agreement, as only the CONSULTANT is explicitly obligated to make repayments upon termination for cause. The absence of reciprocal repayment obligations creates an omission.",

        "explanation": "There is a structural flaw in this section. While the paragraph clearly defines the maximum total annual bonuses for each year from 2005 to 2009, the example provided within the parentheses does not specify which calendar year the consultant is winning every PGA tour major. This omission of the year in the example causes confusion as to what the consultants total bonuses will be for that particular year. ",

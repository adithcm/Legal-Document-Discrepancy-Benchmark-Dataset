        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination if the Launch Date is not achieved within 4 months, BUT it adds a caveat that if only one party used good faith efforts, only that party can terminate. This creates an inconsistency because it doesn't address the scenario where NEITHER party used good faith efforts.  Logically, one would assume either party could terminate in that case, but the explicit wording limits the termination right only to a party that DID use good faith efforts.",

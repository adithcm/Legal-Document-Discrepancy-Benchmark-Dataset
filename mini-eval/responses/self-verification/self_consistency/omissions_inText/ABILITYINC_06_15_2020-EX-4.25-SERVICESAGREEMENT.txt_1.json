        "explanation": "The sentence structure is flawed, and it appears to have an error. It starts with \"This Agreement be deemed effective\" which is grammatically incorrect. It should be \"This Agreement shall be deemed effective\". Also, there is a repeat of the word \"Agreement\" after \"Effective Date,\".",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the terms of payment and related matters. It seems contradictory that this section survives the termination of the agreement, as there would seemingly be no further 'services' to pay for after termination.",

However, it doesn't specify what happens if the invention is created independently by the Provider but utilizes knowledge or skills gained from providing the Services.

        "section": "1.2 (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section indicates that the names, positions, experience levels, and licenses of the Provider Representatives will be listed in Exhibit A. However, Exhibit A (titled 'Services') only contains information about the services being provided and does not include any information about the Provider Representatives. This is an omission in text, creating an internal contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The sentence starts with 'This Agreement be deemed effective'. It appears to be grammatically incorrect and structurally flawed because it includes the word Agreement twice. The word 'be' should be 'will'.",

Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 3.1, all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters.' This section includes details on invoices, payment schedules, dispute resolution, and a 'no right of setoff' clause. However, Section 3.6 outlines the obligation to repay fees and expenses on a pro rata basis for services not provided after termination. If section 2.2 survives termination, it could create ambiguity. For example, if the recipient terminates and has prepaid services, it's unclear if the pro rata refund is subject to the original invoicing and dispute process of 2.2 or handled differently because section 3.6 mandates a pro rata repayment.",

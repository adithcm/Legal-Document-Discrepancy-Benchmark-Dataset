        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. It states that if the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months of the Effective Date, either party may terminate the agreement. However, it then states that if only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the right to terminate. This creates ambiguity as to whether both parties need to have put in effort in order for either party to terminate, or if one party can terminate regardless of the other's efforts.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section has conflicting information about the renewal process. It says that the contract may be renewed with written agreement, and then follows up by saying that if neither party gives notice, it will automatically renew. This creates an ambiguity of whether or not the renewal needs a written agreement or not, since it says it can automatically renew. Therefore, it is not clear if both parties need to agree.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence limits the indemnity to situations where the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. The following sentences broaden the indemnity obligations without this limitation, creating an inconsistency. It is unclear if the initial condition applies to the subsequent indemnity obligations.",

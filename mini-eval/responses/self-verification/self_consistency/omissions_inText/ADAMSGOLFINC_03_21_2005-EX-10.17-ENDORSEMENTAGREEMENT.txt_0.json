        "explanation": "The contract term is not clearly defined because specific details ([* ****] years and [*****] months, [*****] day of [*****]) are redacted. This lack of clarity makes it impossible to determine the exact duration of the agreement, creating ambiguity about the start and end dates of the contract and leading to uncertainty regarding the parties' obligations over time.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The exact minimum number of tournaments required is redacted ([* ****]). This omission creates ambiguity because the standard for 'satisfactory record of play' is tied to a specific, but undefined, number of events. This makes it difficult to determine the consultant's obligations and calculate any potential repayment amounts.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines repayment obligations upon termination due to the consultant's death or inability to play. This obligation to repay could be deemed unconscionable and potentially unenforceable, especially in the event of death. Requiring the estate to repay compensation for services not performed due to death raises ethical and legal concerns.",

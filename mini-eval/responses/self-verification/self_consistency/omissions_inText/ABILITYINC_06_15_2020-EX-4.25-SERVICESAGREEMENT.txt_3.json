Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the names, positions, experience, and licenses of Provider Representatives shall be in Exhibit A. However, Exhibit A only lists 'Services' and contains no information about Provider Representatives. This omission creates a contradiction.",

Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 3.1, all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the terms of payment. If this section survives termination, it implies that payments must still be made even after the agreement has ended. However, the basis for calculating these payments after termination isn't clear, as the services are no longer being provided under the original agreement. This can cause confusion. Is it only payments for past services, or are there other financial obligations?",

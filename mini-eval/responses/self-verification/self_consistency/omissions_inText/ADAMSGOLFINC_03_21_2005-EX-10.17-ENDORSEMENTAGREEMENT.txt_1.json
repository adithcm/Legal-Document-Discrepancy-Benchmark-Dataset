        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses the minimum number of tournaments CONSULTANT needs to play and the repayment schedule if he doesn't meet the minimum. However, the specific number of tournaments required and the repayment amounts are redacted, making it impossible to determine the exact obligations of the CONSULTANT. This creates ambiguity as to the actual repayment terms.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section details the consequences of the CONSULTANT's inability to play golf due to death or other reasons. It states that the CONSULTANT or his estate must repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period, calculated as per paragraph 8A. However, compelling the estate to repay the company due to the death of the consultant is an ambiguity in legal terms. Depending on the jurisdiction, such a clause might be challenged as unconscionable, especially if the death wasn't due to any fault of the consultant.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines the timeframe within which ADAMS GOLF must cease using CONSULTANT's name and likeness upon termination of the agreement. However, the exact timeframes (number of days and months) are redacted. This omission creates ambiguity as the contract does not explicitly define the period ADAMS GOLF has to remove the endorsement, rendering the obligation vague and unenforceable without clarification.",

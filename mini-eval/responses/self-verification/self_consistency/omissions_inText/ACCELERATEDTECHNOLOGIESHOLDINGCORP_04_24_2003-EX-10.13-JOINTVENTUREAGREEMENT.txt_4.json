        "section": "EXHIBIT 10.13 JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. (\"CCGI\") and Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. (\"PVSS\"), (the \"Parties\" or \"Joint Venturers\" if referred to collectively, or the \"Party\" or Joint Venturer\" if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\"), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The agreement explicitly states that the parties associate themselves as 'business associates, and not as partners.' However, it also refers to them as 'Joint Venturers.' While a joint venture can be structured in various ways, the explicit disclaimer of a partnership, coupled with the continuous reference to 'Joint Venturers,' creates ambiguity. This is because the legal implications of a partnership are significantly different from a simple business association, potentially leading to disputes over liability and management responsibilities.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement lacks specificity. It doesn't define the criteria for determining 'as needed,' the process for deciding the amount of such contributions, or the consequences of a Joint Venturer failing to meet a capital call. The ambiguity surrounding capital contributions could lead to disagreements and disputes.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states that 'either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.' This is overly broad. It doesn't specify limitations on this authority, such as a monetary threshold, or types of instruments that require mutual consent. This lack of clarity could allow one Joint Venturer to potentially bind the Joint Venture to significant obligations without the other's explicit approval, creating conflict.",

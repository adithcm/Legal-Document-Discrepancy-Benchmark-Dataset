        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a potential contradiction. It states that if the Launch Date does not occur within 4 months of the Effective Date, either party can terminate the agreement, however, this is only true if both parties used good faith and reasonable development efforts. It then states if only ONE party used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only THAT party may exercise the right to terminate, which is a contradiction to the previous statement.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory. It states that the agreement may be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then goes on to say that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal, the agreement is automatically renewed. This contradicts the need for a mutual written agreement. The agreement is renewed with or without written consent. One statement nullifies the other.",

Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if a force majeure event occurs, the affected party is excused from performance, except for payment. However, the last sentence says the force majeure event does not limit obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification). This is a contradiction, because indemnification could involve payment, thereby creating an obligation for payment even during a force majeure event, which contradicts the initial exception.",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency regarding who bears the expedited shipping costs. It states that Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the example then contradicts this by saying if the purchase order was June 1 with a delivery date of December 1, Accuray bears the cost. The date is 6 months exactly which means it is ambigious who pays for shipping in situations that are exactly 6 months.",

        "explanation": "The text abruptly transitions from the 'entire agreement' clause to contact information for Accuray and the Distributor, Siemens AG. This disrupts the flow and creates confusion as the contact information is not clearly separated from the legal clause. This presents a structural flaw in the text.",

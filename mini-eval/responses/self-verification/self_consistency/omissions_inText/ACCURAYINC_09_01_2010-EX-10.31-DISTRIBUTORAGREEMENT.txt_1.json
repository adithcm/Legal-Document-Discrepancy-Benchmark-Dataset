        "section": "Distributor shall transfer to Accuray upon Accuray's request: any regulatory clearances, licenses or permits obtained for conduct of the business pursuant to this Agreement; any Confidential Information; and other items as negotiated in good faith between the parties.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and potential contradiction. It states that Distributor shall transfer regulatory clearances, licenses, or permits obtained for the business to Accuray upon request. However, Section 4.4 states that Accuray will be responsible for and bear all expenses related to obtaining and maintaining any approvals, permits, and licenses required under any applicable law. It is unclear if the distributor has to obtain the licences, and what happens if the distributor does this, and then transfers them to Accuray",

        "explanation": "This section outlines how conflicts between the Agreement, Quotes, and Purchase Orders are resolved. Generally, the Agreement prevails. However, it creates an exception where a Quote or Purchase Order can supersede the Agreement if signed by specific high-level executives and explicitly states its intent to supersede the Agreement. This creates an ambiguity - this implies that the other sections of this document can be overwritten.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines that Wire Transfers are to be made in advance of the date payment is due. However, section 5.4.1.2.2 says that the remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray, and the receipt by the Distributor. These 2 statements contradict each other.",

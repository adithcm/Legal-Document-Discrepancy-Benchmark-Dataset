        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency in the text. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement of the parties, but then states that if a party does not give notice of non-renewal, the agreement is automatically renewed. These two sentences contradict each other.",

        "explanation": "Section 8.2(b) allows for immediate termination as provided in sections 2.2, 2.4, and 12.4. However, the listed sections don't explicitly provide for immediate termination. Section 2.2 allows for termination if the parties cannot agree to a SOW within 2 months. Section 2.4 does not provide for termination for breach of conduct. Section 12.4 allows termination due to Force Majeure after 60 days. The inclusion of 2.4 here is misaligned.",

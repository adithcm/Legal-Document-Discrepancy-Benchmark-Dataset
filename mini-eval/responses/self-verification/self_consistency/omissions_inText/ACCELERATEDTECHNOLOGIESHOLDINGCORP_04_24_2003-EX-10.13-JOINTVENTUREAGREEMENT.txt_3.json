    {
        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "The clause uses vague language ('as needed') without specifying the criteria or procedure for determining when capital contributions are required, how much each venturer must contribute, and the consequences of failing to contribute. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether a capital call is legitimate and enforceable.",
        "location": "Section 3",

    {
        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement grants each Joint Venturer unilateral authority to execute any instrument, regardless of its magnitude or impact on the Joint Venture. This contradicts the principle of joint control and mutual consent typically expected in a joint venture, as one venturer could potentially bind the entire venture to significant obligations without the other's explicit approval.",

        "section": "Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",
        "explanation": "While the intention to elect out of Subchapter K is clear, the clause conditions the manifestation of this election on it being 'necessary.' This creates ambiguity as to when and how the determination of 'necessity' is made, potentially jeopardizing the effectiveness of the election and leading to unintended tax consequences.",

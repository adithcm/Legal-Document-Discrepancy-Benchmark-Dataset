        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination if the launch date is not achieved within 4 months of the effective date. However, it also adds a condition that only the party who has used good faith efforts can terminate. This creates a potential ambiguity. What happens if neither party uses good faith efforts? Can the agreement still be terminated? The clause doesn't explicitly address this scenario, creating uncertainty.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence of this section contradicts the sentences before it. It states that the agreement is automatically renewed for another year if either party does not give notice of renewal. This contradicts the sentence before it which states that the agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.",

(except that i-Escrow may sell all or a majority of its equity securities or voting interests to i-Escrow.com, and i-Escrow.com may sell all or a majority of its equity securities or voting interests to i-Escrow's existing shareholders, without triggering the foregoing) are acquired by another company during the term of this Agreement either company may terminate this Agreement, without liability, by giving a thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.",
        "explanation": "The clause has a structural flaw. The parenthetical exception regarding i-Escrow's sale of securities to i-Escrow.com and subsequent sales back to existing shareholders is awkwardly worded and disrupts the flow of the sentence. It's unclear how far this exception extends. Does it apply only to sales to i-Escrow.com, or also to the subsequent sales back to existing shareholders? This lack of clarity makes the clause difficult to understand and interpret.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'as needed' is ambiguous and doesn't provide a clear, objective standard for determining when capital contributions are required, how much each venturer should contribute, or the process for determining 'need.' This lack of specificity can lead to disputes.",

        "explanation": "The term 'direct expenses' is broad and undefined. The term doesn't specify limits, documentation requirements, or approval processes for these reimbursements, which can lead to disputes over what constitutes a legitimate 'direct expense.'",

Depreciation and all other charges and expenses, which are not expressly apportioned by this Agreement, shall be apportioned in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.",
        "explanation": "While the agreement specifies a 50/50 split of income, losses, and deductions, it doesn't clarify how specific types of income, credits, losses, and deductions should be treated. The agreement states that depreciation and all other charges and expenses, which are not expressly apportioned by this Agreement, shall be apportioned in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. This part of the text is vague and does not provide a clear legal statement which can lead to multiple interpretations.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"as needed\" is vague and does not provide any specific criteria or process for determining when and how much capital contributions are required. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes between the Joint Venturers regarding their obligations to contribute capital.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This clause grants broad authority to either Joint Venturer to execute instruments without specifying any limitations or requirements for consultation or approval from the other Joint Venturer. This could lead to one Joint Venturer making significant commitments or taking actions that the other Joint Venturer does not agree with or is unaware of, potentially harming the Joint Venture.",

        "explanation": "While the intent to elect out of Subchapter K is clear, the phrase \"if necessary\" regarding the execution and filing of documentation introduces ambiguity. It's unclear under what circumstances it would be deemed \"necessary\" to file the documentation, creating uncertainty about whether the election is definitively made. A proper legal document would not include any ambiguity.",

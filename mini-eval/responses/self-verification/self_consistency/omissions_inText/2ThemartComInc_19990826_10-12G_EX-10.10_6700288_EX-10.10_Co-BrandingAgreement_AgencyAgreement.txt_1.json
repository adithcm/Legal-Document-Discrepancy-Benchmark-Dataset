        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency because it allows only the party that has used 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' to terminate the agreement if the launch date is not met within 4 months. However, the initial statement says that 'either party' may terminate if the launch date is missed. This creates confusion.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory. It states that the agreement can be renewed by 'mutual written agreement' but then goes on to say that 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' This means that the contract can be automatically renewed with no agreement between the two parties, making the renewal by 'mutual written agreement' statement false.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' creates ambiguity and potential contradiction. The typical indemnity clause covers acts/omissions of the indemnifying party, not situations where the indemnified party is somehow considered a principal of the indemnifying party. This is not clearly defined and could lead to disputes about when the indemnity applies.",

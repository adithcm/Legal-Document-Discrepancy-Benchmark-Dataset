        "explanation": "The definition of 'CUSTOMERS' requires them to complete at least one transaction *per month*. This creates an ongoing requirement to maintain customer status. However, the contract doesn't explicitly state the consequences of failing to complete a transaction in a given month, leading to ambiguity. For example, does the user immediately lose customer status? Or does customer status change at all?",

        "explanation": "This clause grants either party the right to terminate the agreement if an SOW isn't agreed upon within two months. However, Section 2.3 states that either party may terminate if the launch date hasn't occurred within four months, conditional on having used good faith and reasonable effort. These clauses could be interpreted as conflicting, as the first allows for termination after two months due to SOW disagreement, while the second potentially requires four months of effort before termination is allowed.",

        "explanation": "The term \u201caverage transaction\u201d is used without a specific definition. There is no clarification if the 'average transaction' is based on all transactions facilitated by i-Escrow or only transactions originating from the Co-Branded Site.

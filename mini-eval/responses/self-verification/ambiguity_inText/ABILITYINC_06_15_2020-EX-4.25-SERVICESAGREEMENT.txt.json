        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity. While the Provider agrees to provide services in Exhibit A, it simultaneously reserves the right to refuse additional services, even if necessary for the Recipient's operation, based on its own discretion. This weakens the initial agreement to provide all services outlined in Exhibit A, as the Provider can unilaterally decide which 'necessary' services to deny.",

        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and does not make sense. It contains a grammatical error ('Agreement be deemed' instead of 'Agreement shall be deemed') and awkwardly repeats the word 'Agreement'.",

        "explanation": "This section references that the provisions of Section 2.2 survive termination of the agreement. Section 2.2 outlines the terms of payment which involves an invoice. If the agreement is terminated there may be no need to create an invoice and pay each other if no service is rendered, thus this creates an ambiguity of what the invoice would be for after termination.",

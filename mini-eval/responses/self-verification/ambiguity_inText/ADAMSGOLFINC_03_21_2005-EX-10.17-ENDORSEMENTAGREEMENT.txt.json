        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination of the agreement if the Consultant dies or cannot play golf. It states that the Consultant or their estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the period of the agreement not performed, calculated as per paragraph 8A. However, it seems contradictory and unreasonable to expect repayment from the Consultant's estate in the event of death. It's unusual to demand repayment when the inability to perform is due to death, making the clause harsh and potentially unenforceable.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The wording requires the CONSULTANT to achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [*****] events. However, 'satisfactory record of play' is subjective and undefined, creating ambiguity. Furthermore, there is no criteria of what defines a satisfactory record of play, which may lead to disputes about if the CONSULTANT met the requirements of the contract.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that CONSULTANT will indemnify ADAMS GOLF from all liabilities, claims, etc., excluding attorney fees. However, the second sentence then states ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000. This creates a direct contradiction as it first excludes and then includes a specific type of expense (attorney fees), leading to confusion.",

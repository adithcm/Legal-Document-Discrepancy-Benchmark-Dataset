        "explanation": "The contract states that the term begins on September 1, 2004, but the specific end date is redacted. This omission makes it impossible to determine the exact duration of the agreement, creating uncertainty about the parties' obligations and the overall term of the contract. This lack of a defined end date means that the duration of the contract is vague.",

However, ADAMS GOLF acknowledges that from time to time, CONSULTANT may, at his discretion, utilize products from other manufacturers if ADAMS GOLF's products are deemed unsuitable or unavailable for a specific tournament or event.",
        "explanation": "This section defines 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS' as those that the consultant must exclusively use. However, it immediately introduces an exception, stating the consultant can use other manufacturers' products if Adams Golf's products are unsuitable or unavailable. This creates an in-text contradiction because the term 'mandatory' implies a strict requirement, which is then undermined by the allowance for alternatives. It does not outline what products from Adams Golf are mandatory and does not give enough information.",

Payment of the base compensation will be subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value.",
        "explanation": "The use of the word 'intends' to pay creates a discrepancy. In contract law, 'intends' does not create an obligation. Furthermore, stating that the base compensation is 'subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value' makes the compensation amount uncertain and dependent on subjective factors. This weakens the enforceability of the compensation clause and makes it so that Adams Golf does not have to pay Watson the compensation.",

        "section": "1.2 Standard of Service. (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the 'Provider Representatives' details 'shall be set out in Exhibit A'. However, Exhibit A only refers to 'Services' provided, and does not mention the Provider Representatives at all. This creates an in-text contradiction since the contract stipulates that certain information will be in a specified location, but that location does not contain that information.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence in section 3.1 is an example of structural flaws in text. The sentence does not make sense and is not structured properly. It says 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement'. It uses the word 'Agreement' twice and does not make much sense.",

Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 3.1, all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section states that section 2.2 survives termination of the agreement. However, section 2.2 details 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters'. If the agreement is terminated, there are no more services being provided, so it does not make sense that terms of payment still survives the termination, which means that payment will still be required after the agreement has been terminated. The survival of payment terms needs to be better defined.",

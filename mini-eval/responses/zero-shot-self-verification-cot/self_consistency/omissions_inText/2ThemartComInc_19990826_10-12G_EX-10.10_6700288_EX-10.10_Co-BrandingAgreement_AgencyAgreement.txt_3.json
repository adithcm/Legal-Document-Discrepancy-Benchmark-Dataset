        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The text states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement 30 days before expiration. Then, the following sentence states that if no notice is given, the agreement is automatically renewed for one year. These two sentences contradict each other, as one requires a mutual agreement, while the other automatically renews the contract.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the conditions under which a party may immediately terminate the agreement for breach, but subsection (a) contradicts this by stating that termination is allowed if the breach is not cured within sixty (60) days. The immediate termination is then contradicted by the 60 day period.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence of Section 9 contains ambiguous terminology that could lead to in-text contradictions when enforced in a court of law. The sentence states that a party will be indemnified against losses that the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts. However, the sentence includes the condition that the indemnification is only applicable \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.\" The sentence's inclusion of principal/agent dynamics is ambiguous and misaligned, as it isn't standard for an agent to indemnify the principal. This could confuse contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.",

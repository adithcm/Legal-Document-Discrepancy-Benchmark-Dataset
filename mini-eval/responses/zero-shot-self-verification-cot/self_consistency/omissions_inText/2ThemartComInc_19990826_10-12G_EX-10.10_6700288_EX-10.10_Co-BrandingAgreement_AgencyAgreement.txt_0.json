        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination rights if the launch date isn't met within 4 months of the effective date. However, it introduces a conditional clause stating that if only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party can terminate. This creates an inconsistency. What if neither party used 'good faith and reasonable development efforts'? The section does not address this scenario, thus it creates ambiguity as to whether either party could terminate in that situation.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The statement 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year' is a contradiction. The agreement states that to renew this agreement it needs to be a mutual written agreement, but then says that if either party does not give notice, the agreement is automatically renewed. This is not a mutual agreement if either party does not provide such notice. This is a contradiction.",

In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of Section 9 states that each party will indemnify the other for claims arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions, or misrepresentations 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party'. This qualifying phrase significantly limits the scope of indemnification and introduces ambiguity. The phrase is not clearly defined, and it's unclear under what circumstances an Indemnified Party would be 'deemed a principal' of the Indemnifying Party. The following sentences provide additional specific indemnification obligations for 2TheMart and i-Escrow, but these obligations are not explicitly tied to the 'deemed a principal' condition, creating uncertainty about whether that condition applies to these specific obligations as well.",

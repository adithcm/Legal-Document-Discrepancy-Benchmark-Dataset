        "section": "1.2 Standard of Service. (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a potential contradiction. It states that Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing services to the Recipient, and shall not provide any such services to the Provider or any other customer. This could be interpreted as preventing the Provider Representatives from performing any internal work for the Provider, even if it is administrative and unrelated to the Services provided to the Recipient, which is likely not the intent. This is ambiguous because 'such services' is not defined clearly enough, and could mean all services, or the specific services the representatives are contracted to provide.",

        "explanation": "This section has a structural flaw because it's very oddly worded and grammatically incorrect. The sentence reads, \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.\" The sentence does not read as if it is a legal agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section creates a potential inconsistency because Section 2.2 outlines the 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters.' This seems to imply that even after the contract is terminated, the payment terms outlined will continue to apply. Without any additional clarification, this is strange because after the agreement is terminated, there should not be any more payment obligations, except for the payment of previously rendered services.",

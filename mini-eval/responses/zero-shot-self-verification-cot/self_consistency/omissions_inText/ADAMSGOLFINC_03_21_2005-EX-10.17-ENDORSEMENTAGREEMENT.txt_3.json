        "explanation": "The contract states a term of agreement with the start date but doesn't provide a specific end date due to redaction. This lack of a definitive end date creates ambiguity about the agreement's duration and the obligations of each party, such as the period for which the endorsement rights are granted and the compensation is to be paid. Since it does not specify, it is an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a potential contradiction. While stating the consultant must exclusively use MANDATORY PRODUCTS, it immediately provides an exception allowing for the use of other clubs (including a putter from another manufacturer). This creates a contradiction: What MANDATORY PRODUCTS must the consultant exclusively use? It is not clear and not well defined.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section seems to imply that if the CONSULTANT dies, the estate is responsible to pay back the company. A dead person cannot 'not perform.' This does not make logical sense and a court would likely rule this unenforcable. This also is not properly structured and does not make sense.",

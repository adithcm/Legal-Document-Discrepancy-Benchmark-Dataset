        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Provider Representatives must be 'solely' dedicated to Recipient. However, Section 1.1(a) indicates that Provider agrees to respond to requests for 'additional services and resources' not currently contemplated in the Exhibit. If these additional services require the Provider Representatives' time, it could contradict the requirement for 'sole' dedication to Recipient's initially defined services.",

        "explanation": "There is a structural flaw in this sentence because there is extra wording that does not need to be there. 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020' should be 'This Agreement shall terminate on December 31, 2020'.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines terms of payment. It is unusual to include that the terms of payment survive the termination of the agreement, but is not incorrect. Section 3.6(e) also speaks about payment after termination in regard to 'repay all fees and expenses paid in advance for any Services which have not been provided.' Since both sections deal with payment after termination and Section 2.2 survives, there is an inconsistency in what happens to payment and could be disputed.",

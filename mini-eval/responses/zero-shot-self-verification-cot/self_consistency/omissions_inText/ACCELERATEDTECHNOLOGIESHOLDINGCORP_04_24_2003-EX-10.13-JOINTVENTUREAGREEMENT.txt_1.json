        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement lacks specifics regarding how the need for capital contributions will be determined, the process for deciding the amount of contribution required from each Joint Venturer, and the consequences of failing to meet a capital call. The absence of clarity creates ambiguity and potential for disputes in the future. It is not clear on who decides on when the capital is needed. This makes the text structurally flawed.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "While granting broad authority seems efficient, it lacks limitations and controls. 'Instruments of any character' is excessively broad. This could lead to one Joint Venturer making decisions or executing agreements that are not in the best interest of the Joint Venture or without the consent/knowledge of the other Joint Venturer. This section contradicts the earlier statement that 'The Joint Venturers shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture' as the sentence prior makes it appear that both parties need to be in charge together, not either or.",

        "section": "Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",
        "explanation": "While the intent to elect out of Subchapter K is clear, the phrase 'if necessary' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear who determines if it's 'necessary' to file documentation. The lack of clarity surrounding the 'if necessary' condition creates a potential loophole where the necessary documentation may not be filed. This can lead to legal and tax implications. This can be seen as a structural flaw.",

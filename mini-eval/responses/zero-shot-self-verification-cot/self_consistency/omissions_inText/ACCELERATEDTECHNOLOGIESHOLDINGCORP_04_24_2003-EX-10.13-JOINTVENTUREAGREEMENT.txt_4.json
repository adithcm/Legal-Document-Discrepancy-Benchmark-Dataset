        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it doesn't define how the need for capital contributions is determined, who decides the amount, and the consequences of a Joint Venturer failing to contribute. The lack of clarity could lead to disagreements and disputes regarding the financial obligations of each party, creating potential legal issues.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section grants broad authority to either Joint Venturer to execute instruments without specifying limitations or requiring consent from the other Joint Venturer. This could lead to potential conflicts of interest or financial liabilities if one Joint Venturer acts unilaterally without considering the impact on the other or the Joint Venture as a whole. The absence of checks and balances on this authority creates a risk of mismanagement or abuse.",

        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section describes that distributions can only be made if assets are in excess of liabilities, but it is missing critical information. The contract lacks clarity regarding how assets and liabilities are valued for the purpose of determining distribution eligibility. This ambiguity can lead to disputes over the calculation of net assets and whether a distribution is permissible. Additionally, it does not describe who makes the decision on distributions.",

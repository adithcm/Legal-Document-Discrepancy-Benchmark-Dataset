        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section includes contradictory statements regarding who bears the supplementary shipping costs. In the general statement, it says the Distributor bears the costs. The first example is if the purchase order was submitted on June 1st with a delivery date of December 1st, Accuray bears the cost. The second example is if the purchase order was submitted on June 1st with a delivery date of October 1st, the Distributor bears the cost.",

        "explanation": "This section states the 'remaining balance' is due net 30 days after delivery. However, section 5.4.1.2. states a wire transfer is made in advance of the date payment is due. It is not possible to pay in advance and then also have a net 30 days payment.",

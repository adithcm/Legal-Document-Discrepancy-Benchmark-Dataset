        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The text states that the agreement is renewed automatically if neither party gives notice of non-renewal. However, it also states that the agreement may be renewed for successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term. These two statements contradict each other, as one requires a mutual written agreement for renewal, while the other allows for automatic renewal without such agreement. This creates ambiguity as to the actual renewal process.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that each party will indemnify the other for claims arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions, or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. The following sentences then state that 2TheMart will indemnify i-Escrow for claims arising from 2TheMart Content and i-Escrow will indemnify 2TheMart for claims arising from i-Escrow Content and/or Services. The initial sentence limits the indemnity to situations where the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party, while the subsequent sentences do not include this limitation. This creates a contradiction in the scope of the indemnity obligation.",

        "section": "6.7 SERVICE STANDARDS. i-Escrow will comply with all laws and regulations and act as an Independent Escrow Agent as per the guidelines of California Escrow Law. Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This section states that California Escrow Law will prevail if there is a conflict. However, it also states that i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of the conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict. While the agreement states that California Escrow Law shall prevail, the secondary statement implies that both parties will attempt to resolve it. This creates an ambiguity in the text as it should be clear that California Escrow Law immediately takes precedence.",

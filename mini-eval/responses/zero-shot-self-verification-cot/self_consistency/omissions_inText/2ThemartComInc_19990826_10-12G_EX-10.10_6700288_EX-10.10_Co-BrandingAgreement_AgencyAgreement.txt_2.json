        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence in Section 8.1 states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal, the agreement is automatically renewed for another year. This directly contradicts the earlier statement that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.' An automatic renewal does not constitute a mutual written agreement.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' introduces ambiguity.  In a typical independent contractor relationship (which is what Section 12.5 establishes), one party is *not* the principal of the other.  This clause seems to contradict the stated independent contractor relationship because it creates a condition where indemnification is dependent on a principal-agent relationship, which the agreement explicitly disclaims. This section sets up a condition which is highly unlikely in the framework of the contract, therefore making the enforceability of this clause vague.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency in the procedure for terminating the agreement for specific types of breaches. Subsection (a) states that for a material breach, the breaching party has 60 days to cure the breach after written notice. However, subsection (b) allows for *immediate* termination for breaches as described in Sections 2.2, 2.4, and 12.4. This is an inconsistent text, because if a breach occurs under sections 2.2, 2.4, and 12.4 it could also be interpreted as a material breach. However, section 8.2 has a set procedure to follow, therefore contradicting itself.",

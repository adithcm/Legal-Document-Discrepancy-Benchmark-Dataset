        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination if the launch date is not achieved within 4 months, BUT it also adds a condition that only the party that used good faith development efforts can terminate. This condition introduces ambiguity because it requires a subjective assessment of each party's efforts. It is unclear how 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' will be judged and who will be responsible for making this determination. This can lead to disputes about whether a party genuinely tried hard enough, even if the launch date wasn't met, making it harder to determine which party has the right to terminate.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal process. It states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement' but then adds that 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' This contradicts the first statement because it suggests that if neither party gives notice to terminate, the agreement automatically renews, regardless of whether there is a mutual written agreement or not. Therefore, written agreement and no notice is contradictory.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "This section states that a party may 'immediately terminate' the agreement for a material breach if the breach is not cured within 60 days. This is a contradiction. It cannot be both immediate and after 60 days. This creates ambiguity around when the termination is effective and could lead to conflict if one party considers it terminated immediately upon notice of breach, while the other expects the 60-day cure period.",

        "section": "This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",
        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and grammatically incorrect. It contains repetitive language and lacks clarity in expressing the agreement's duration. The sentence begins with \"This Agreement be deemed effective\" which is incorrect. It should say, \"This Agreement shall be deemed effective.\" The term 'Agreement' is repeated and there should be a proper date mentioned in the statement.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines the conditions under which a party can terminate the agreement due to a breach by the other party. However, it doesn't specify the length of the prior written notice required for termination. The absence of a defined notice period creates ambiguity and potential disputes, as it's unclear how much advance warning the Breaching Party must receive before termination takes effect. Section 3.2 outlines a 90 day notice period, this section should reference that as well.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines Terms of Payment and Related Matters. If the agreement is terminated, all the obligations of the parties should terminate, but this section indicates that the terms of payment will survive any termination or expiration of the agreement. This is a contradiction and does not make sense.",

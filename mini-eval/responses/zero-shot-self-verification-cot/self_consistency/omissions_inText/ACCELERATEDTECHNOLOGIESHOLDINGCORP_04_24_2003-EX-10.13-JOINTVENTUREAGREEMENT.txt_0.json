        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement is vague and does not specify how the need for capital contributions will be determined, how much each venturer will be required to contribute, or the consequences of failing to contribute. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes over funding obligations and creates ambiguity about the financial responsibilities of each party.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement grants each joint venturer broad authority to execute instruments without specifying any limitations or requirements for consultation with the other venturer. This could potentially lead to one venturer making decisions or entering into agreements that are detrimental to the Joint Venture's interests without the other venturer's knowledge or consent, creating a conflict of interest.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers agree and declare that this association for the carrying on of a joint venture business operation does not, and is not intended to create a partnership, for either legal or United States income tax purposes, each Party recognizing that the other is willing and able to contribute capital, labor, and services for the operation of a successful joint venture business. Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",
        "explanation": "While aiming to avoid partnership classification for tax purposes, this section attempts to contractually opt-out of Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the effectiveness of such an election depends on meeting specific IRS requirements and actually filing the necessary documentation. The contract language only states an agreement to file if 'necessary,' creating ambiguity about whether the election will actually be made and undermining the certainty of their tax treatment. This could potentially result in unintended partnership taxation if the necessary filings are not completed properly. This is a discrepancy because the section is saying that the agreement will not create a partnership for legal or United States income tax purposes.",

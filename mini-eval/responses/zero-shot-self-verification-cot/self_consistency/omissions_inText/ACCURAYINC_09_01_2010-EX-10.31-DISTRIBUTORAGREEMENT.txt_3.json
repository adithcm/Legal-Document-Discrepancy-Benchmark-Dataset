        "explanation": "This definition is incomplete and doesn't provide any specific information about what constitutes a 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase'. This is too vague and does not provide any information on what it means. It simply says it means a purchase, which is already obvious.",

        "section": "Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "This sentence is setting up an approval/disapproval deadline of two weeks. Then it states that if Accuray fails to approve or disapprove the Purchase Order in the two week window, then this failure will result in disapproval of the purchase order. This seems contradictory because if Accuray did nothing it would result in a disapproval. So there really isn't a need to reject the purchase order in this instance.",

In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use.",
        "explanation": "The text states that Accuray warrants to each customer that the products will be free from defects and perform in accordance with the written specifications. However, the next set of sentences prohibits the Distributor, Customer, or their agents from using the system before installation without Accuray's approval. This creates a contradiction because if the system isn't even installed yet then that also means that it has not yet been used. It doesn't make sense to warrant a product that cannot even be used.",

(c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section describes that the Provider Representatives should be outlined in Exhibit A. However, Exhibit A only describes 'Services.' This is a contradiction because Exhibit A is supposed to contain information that it does not actually have. This may lead to the Recipient not knowing who the Provider Representatives are.",

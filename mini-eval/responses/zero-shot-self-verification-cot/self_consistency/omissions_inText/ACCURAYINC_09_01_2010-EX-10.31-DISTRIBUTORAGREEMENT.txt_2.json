        "section": "1.4. \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" means a purchase.",
        "explanation": "This definition is too vague and does not provide any meaningful information about what constitutes a 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase.' It simply states that it 'means a purchase,' which is redundant and unhelpful. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over whether a particular transaction qualifies as such a purchase under the agreement.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The section contains contradictory information regarding the acceptance of Purchase Orders. The first part says Accuray's failure to respond within two weeks constitutes disapproval, while the last sentence states that acceptance occurs through execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative. This creates confusion about whether a lack of response is a rejection or if formal execution is always required for acceptance.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency regarding who bears the cost of expedited shipping. It initially states that Accuray bills any actual freight costs to the Distributor. However, it then contradicts this by stating that Accuray will bear supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission. This creates an inconsistency on who pays for expedited shipping depending on the lead time.",

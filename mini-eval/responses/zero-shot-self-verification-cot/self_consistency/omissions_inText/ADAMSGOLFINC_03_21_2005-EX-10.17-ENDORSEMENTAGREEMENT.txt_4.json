        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity because while the consultant is required to exclusively use 'Mandatory Products,' there is allowance to use other clubs that aren't Adams Golf, inlcuding a putter. However, the definition of 'Product' in Section 2.B is defined as 'golf clubs', but 'Mandatory Products' is described as Adams Golf PRODUCTS. So does 'golf clubs' include putters or not? This is ambigious and can have multiple interpretations.",

        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous regarding the scope of 'every opportunity.' The phrase 'every opportunity' is vague and doesn't set a concrete standard. It's unclear what constitutes a reasonable effort to 'discuss and emphasize the newest features'. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether the consultant is fulfilling his obligations.",

        "explanation": "This section seems to imply that the consultant wears ADAMS GOLF branded items when participating in photo shoots for another sponsor, however it is missing some information. This is a Structural Flaw because it's missing information.",

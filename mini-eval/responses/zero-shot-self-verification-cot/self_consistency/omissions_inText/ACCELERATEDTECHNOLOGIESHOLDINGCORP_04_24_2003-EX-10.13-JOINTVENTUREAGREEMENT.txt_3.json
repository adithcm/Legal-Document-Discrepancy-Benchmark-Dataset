        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it does not define the conditions or procedures under which capital contributions will be deemed 'needed'. It doesn't specify who decides when contributions are needed, how the amount is determined, or the consequences of a Joint Venturer failing to make a required contribution. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over financial obligations within the Joint Venture.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This clause grants each Joint Venturer broad authority to execute instruments related to the Joint Venture's affairs, without specifying limitations or requiring consent from the other Joint Venturer. This is problematic because it could potentially allow one Joint Venturer to enter into significant obligations or agreements on behalf of the Joint Venture without the other's knowledge or approval, potentially creating conflicts of interest or jeopardizing the Joint Venture's financial stability.",

    {
        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section mandates that distributions can only occur if the Joint Venture's assets exceed its liabilities after the distribution. While aiming to protect solvency, it lacks specifics on how 'assets' and 'liabilities' are valued for this calculation. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles would dictate this, but not stating this creates ambiguity in the text. Moreover, it doesn't clarify who makes the determination about the asset-liability balance or what recourse exists if a distribution is made improperly. The lack of clarity can cause future issues.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section includes contradictory statements regarding the acceptance of Purchase Orders. First, it states that Accuray must accept or reject a Purchase Order within two weeks, with failure to do so constituting disapproval. However, it then states that 'Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.' This creates confusion: does Accuray's silence for two weeks mean automatic rejection, or does acceptance require explicit execution of the Purchase Order?",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency in responsibility for expedited shipping costs. It states that Accuray is responsible for expedited delivery costs if the requested delivery date is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, it also includes an example where if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor. This is misaligned since it does not state who is responsible if the product is requested to be delivered in December 2.",

        "explanation": "This section discusses the relationship between this agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement, stating that this agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement contain the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior understandings. However, it also states that 'In case of any contradiction between this Agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.' This suggests that the Strategic Alliance Agreement still holds some relevance, creating a contradiction with the idea of a single, entire agreement and contradicts the superseding nature of the agreement.",

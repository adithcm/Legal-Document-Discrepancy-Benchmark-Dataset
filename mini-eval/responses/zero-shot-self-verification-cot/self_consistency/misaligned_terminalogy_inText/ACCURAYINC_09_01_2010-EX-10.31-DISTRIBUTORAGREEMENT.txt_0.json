        "section": "3.6. Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that for each sale completed by the Distributor, a Purchase Order must be sent to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. However, Section 4.1.2 states that if a Purchase Order is submitted six months before the requested delivery date, Accuray will bear supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery if needed to meet the deadline. This creates a disincentive for the Distributor to adhere to the six-month notice, as expedited shipping costs become Accuray's responsibility if the deadline is missed, regardless of whether the delay is the Distributor's fault.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "Section 4.1.2 contains contradictory statements regarding who bears the cost of expedited shipping. It states that Accuray will bear the costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, it also implies that if the delivery deadline is less than six months after the submission, the Distributor bears the costs. This discrepancy creates ambiguity, as it does not clearly define the circumstances under which each party is responsible for expedited shipping costs, leading to potential disputes.",

        "section": "5.4.1. System Purchase Payments. Payment for the purchase of a System shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars in the form of either (1) an irrevocable trade finance letter of credit or (2) wire transfer as further described in Sections 5.4.1.1 (Letter of Credit) and 5.4.1.2 (Wire Transfer), respectively below. Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "Section 5.4.1 introduces a condition for when payment is considered past due for distributors defined as \"business person\" under  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\". This introduces a legal term and a specific condition that may not be universally understood or applicable outside of German legal context. It creates a potential ambiguity and a legal contradiction because the contract is governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. This means that German law dictates when a payment is actually past due, not the contents of this contract.",

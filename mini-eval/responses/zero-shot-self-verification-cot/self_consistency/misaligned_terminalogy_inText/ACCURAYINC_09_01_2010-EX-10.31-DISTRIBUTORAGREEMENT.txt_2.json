        "explanation": "The definition of 'Distributor' and 'Partner' are misaligned. The first sentence defines 'Distributor' as Siemens. The second sentence expands 'Partner' to include Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party with distribution rights granted by Siemens. This creates confusion, as the terms are used inconsistently.",

To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section contains inconsistent text. Accuray has two weeks to either accept or reject a purchase order, and failure to do so constitutes disapproval. However, the following sentence states that a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This does not specify a time frame. This creates confusion as to whether or not the purchase order can still be executed after the two week time frame. ",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",

The second half of the paragraph states that any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor, and that otherwise, the Distributor will pay.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal process. It initially states that renewal requires mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term. However, it later states that if a party doesn't provide notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates an inconsistency, as the initial statement implies active agreement is required, while the subsequent statement suggests passive renewal if no action is taken.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of Section 9 states that the Guarantor protects the Protected Party from liabilities if the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. This creates an Ambiguity of text, because the word 'agent' is not defined in the document. Also, later in Section 9, this condition of 'key agent' is dropped and it simply states that 2TheMart and i-Escrow will indemnify each other for grievances arising from their respective materials. Thus, the initial requirement of the Protected Party being a 'key agent' appears to be contradicted later in the same section.",

        "section": "12.4 FORCE MAJEURE. Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "Section 12.4 discusses force majeure and its impact on performance. It states that if a force majeure event interferes with the agreement for 60 days or more, either party can terminate the agreement without penalty. However, the last sentence of the section states that the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification). This creates a potential contradiction. If a party's inability to perform is caused by a force majeure event lasting more than 60 days (leading to termination), the obligation to indemnify under Section 9 should arguably also be affected by the force majeure event, yet the contract explicitly states it is not.",

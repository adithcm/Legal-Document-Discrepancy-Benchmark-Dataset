        "section": "A. Recipient wishes to engage the Vendor to provide certain services and resources (the \"Deliverables\") and Provider desires to provide Recipient with the Services all in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.",
        "explanation": "The Recitals section introduces the term \"Vendor\" and states that Recipient wishes to engage the Vendor. However, the rest of the agreement refers to the service provider as \"Provider\", not \"Vendor\". This creates confusion because it is not clear if \"Vendor\" and \"Provider\" are supposed to be the same entity. This introduces ambiguity as to which party is responsible for providing the services.",

The text states \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020\".

        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement creates ambiguity regarding the financial obligations of the Joint Venturers. While it initially suggests no mandatory capital contributions, the phrase 'Except as agreed upon by mutual consent' introduces uncertainty. It remains unclear under what circumstances mutual consent would be obtained, the extent of potential contributions, and the consequences of failing to meet such agreed-upon contributions. This ambiguity can lead to future disputes over financial responsibilities within the Joint Venture.",

        "section": "The Founders shall maintain adequate books and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The term 'Founders' is used here instead of 'Joint Venturers.' While it might be implied that the Founders and Joint Venturers are the same, using different terms without explicitly defining them as interchangeable leads to confusion and potential misinterpretation. This misalignment can create uncertainty regarding who is responsible for maintaining the books and records, hindering transparency and accountability within the Joint Venture.",

        "explanation": "This section is problematic because it creates a contradiction in the term of the joint venture, making it ambiguous. The text explicitly states that the joint venture will last until February 28, 2004, unless both parties decide to extend the agreement. The contradiction arises because there is no specification of when the agreement needs to be in place before the termination date. Without a specific timeframe, it could be argued that an extension agreement could be reached even on the 28th of February, negating the condition of 'not less than thirty (30) days prior'.",

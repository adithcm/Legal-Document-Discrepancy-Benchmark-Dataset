        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the process for Accuray to accept or reject a Purchase Order. It states that Accuray has two weeks to either accept or reject a Purchase Order. However, it also states that a failure to approve or disapprove within that period constitutes disapproval. This is contradictory, as it implies both action (rejection) and inaction (failure to act) result in the same outcome (disapproval).",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines responsibility for expedited shipping costs when delivery deadlines are not met. It states that if the requested delivery date is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, Accuray bears expedited costs. However, the example contradicts this rule. If the Purchase Order is submitted June 1 with a requested delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months later), Accuray bears the costs. But if the requested date is October 1 (less than six months), the Distributor bears the costs. There is ambiguity regarding whether the date must be greater than 6 months, or greater than or equal to 6 months.",

        "section": "5.4.1. System Purchase Payments. Payment for the purchase of a System shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars in the form of either (1) an irrevocable trade finance letter of credit or (2) wire transfer as further described in Sections 5.4.1.1 (Letter of Credit) and 5.4.1.2 (Wire Transfer), respectively below. Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "This section deals with payment for system purchases. In the beginning it states that wire transfers need to be made in advance of the date payment is due, but then specifies that past due balances bear interest. This statement is contradictory because wire transfers cannot be past due if they are supposed to be made in advance of the payment date.",

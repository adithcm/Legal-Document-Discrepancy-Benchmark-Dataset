        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens. For the purposes of clarity within this document, a Partner is classified as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Distributor\" is explicitly \"Siemens.\" However, the subsequent sentence expands the definition of \"Partner\" to include Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party with distribution rights granted by Siemens. This creates a potential contradiction because, without clear differentiation, the terms \"Distributor\" and \"Partner\" could be used interchangeably, leading to confusion about which entities are directly bound by the obligations specifically assigned to the \"Distributor\" throughout the agreement. For example, if a section refers to the 'Distributor' providing a report, it's unclear if Siemens' Affiliates or Third Parties are also obligated to provide the report, or if it's solely Siemens' responsibility.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The first part of this section states that Accuray's failure to respond to a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, the following sentence states that each purchase 'shall be accomplished' and a Purchase Order 'may be accepted' by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. The contradiction lies in whether Accuray's inaction is definitively disapproval, or if a purchase can only be 'accomplished' through explicit execution, implying inaction is not necessarily disapproval. This creates ambiguity in the purchase order acceptance process.",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the responsibility for expedited shipping costs based on the delivery deadline requested in the Purchase Order. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order, Accuray bears the expedited costs. The example clarifies this, but the ambiguity arises from the phrase 'at least six months after the submission'. Does this mean exactly six months, or more than six months? This lack of precision can lead to disputes regarding who is responsible for expedited shipping costs when the delivery deadline falls exactly six months after the Purchase Order submission date.",

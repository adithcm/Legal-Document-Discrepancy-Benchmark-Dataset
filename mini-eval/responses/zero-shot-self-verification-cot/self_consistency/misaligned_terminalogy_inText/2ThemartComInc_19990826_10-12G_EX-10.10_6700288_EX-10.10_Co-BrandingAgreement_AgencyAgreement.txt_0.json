        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section details the term and renewal process of the agreement. It states that the agreement is automatically renewed for another year if neither party gives notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before expiration. However, it also mentions that the agreement can be renewed for successive one-year terms by mutual written agreement prior to the conclusion of the term. These two sentences contradict each other. One sentence suggests automatic renewal unless notice is given, while the other suggests renewal requires a mutual written agreement. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual renewal process.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The initial part of this section states that the Guarantor will protect the Protected Party from liabilities resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. This condition of the Protected Party being a 'key agent' introduces ambiguity, as it is undefined and could lead to disputes about whether the indemnity applies in a specific situation. Also the last sentence of this section does not make sense. It seems like the word patrons does not fit here and does not make sense. It could be assumed it means customers, but that assumption would be an error.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The calculation method for the advertising fees is vague and potentially contradictory. It states the fee is calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. However, 'Customer Engagement' is not clearly defined, leading to ambiguity. Also, even though 'Customer Engagement' is not clearly defined it states that the fees are based on the volume of customer engagements. The two statements do not go hand in hand.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section contains an internal contradiction. It initially states that the CONSULTANT shall exclusively use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, which should imply using exclusively ADAMS GOLF products. However, the subsequent sentence explicitly allows the use of other clubs, including a putter from another manufacturer. While it restricts endorsement of these other clubs, the allowance of their use directly contradicts the initial exclusivity statement. This creates ambiguity about the extent of the exclusivity and which products the exclusivity applies to. Are the MANDATORY PRODUCTS the only products that must be exclusively Adams Golf, or is the entire set of clubs supposed to be exclusively Adams Golf? This could lead to disputes over what constitutes a breach of the exclusivity clause.",

        "section": "8. MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The text presents an inconsistency because it mentions a minimum number of events to achieve a 'satisfactory record of play' but does not define what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play'. This is an ambiguity in the text, as the criteria for determining what constitutes a satisfactory record of play are not outlined, and whether satisfactory record of play refers to winning, or simply competing.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses the termination of the agreement due to the consultant's death or inability to play golf. It stipulates that upon termination, the consultant or their estate shall repay ADAMS GOLF for the period of the agreement not performed, calculated as per paragraph 8A. However, this creates a contradiction. If the consultant dies, they cannot perform any further services, triggering the repayment clause. This could be seen as unconscionable or against public policy, as it essentially penalizes the estate for an event beyond anyone's control. It is unusual and potentially unenforceable to demand repayment of compensation already paid for a service that could not be completed due to death or total disability, especially since ADAMS GOLF would also be free to engage another consultant. It would be a structural flaw for legal terms because it does not make sense for an estate to pay for a service that can no longer be performed due to death.",

The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "Section 4 outlines the exclusivity of the endorsement, preventing Watson from endorsing competing products. However, subsection D provides an exception, allowing Watson to endorse [*****] under specific conditions. The text uses vague language like \"executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice\" and \"similarly situated professional golfers.\" This creates ambiguity. What constitutes \"similar\" and how is past practice defined? This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine the exact scope of the permitted endorsement and enforce the restrictions, potentially leading to disputes.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT: A.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude, B.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community, D.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT. ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
        "explanation": "Section 12 lists behaviors that could lead to termination of the agreement. The phrase \"due regard to public morals and conventions\" is highly subjective and open to interpretation. Similarly, terms like \"public disrepute,\" \"contempt,\" \"scandal,\" \"ridicule,\" and \"insults or offends the community\" lack precise legal definitions. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine what specific actions would constitute a breach of contract, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes over termination.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Section 22 allows ADAMS GOLF to terminate the agreement if Watson dies or is unable to play golf. It then states that Watson's estate shall repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A. It does not make sense to apply the rules in 8A in the event of death, because that section is regarding the minimum number of tournaments. This repayment scheme seems inappropriate and potentially unconscionable in the event of death, given the nature of the agreement and the potential financial burden on the estate.",

        "explanation": "The Recitals section introduces both 'Deliverables' and 'Services' but doesn't clearly distinguish between them. Later, the document focuses almost exclusively on 'Services,' making the initial reference to 'Deliverables' potentially confusing and creating ambiguity about whether 'Deliverables' are a subset of 'Services,' a distinct offering, or simply used interchangeably. This misalignment could lead to disagreements about the scope of Provider's obligations.",

(a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. Notwithstanding the contents of the Exhibit, Provider agrees to respond in good faith to any reasonable request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, at a price to be agreed upon after good faith negotiations between the Parties. Any such additional services and resources so provided by Provider shall constitute Services under this Agreement and be subject in all respect to the provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on the Exhibit as of the date hereof.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Exhibit A sets forth the services, but then it allows for additional services to be added through good faith negotiation. It also states that any additional services will constitute services under this agreement and be subject in all respects to the provisions of this agreement AS IF fully set forth on the Exhibit as of the date hereof. It's unclear how something can be subject to an exhibit as of the date hereof, when that service was agreed to in good faith negotiation at a later date.",

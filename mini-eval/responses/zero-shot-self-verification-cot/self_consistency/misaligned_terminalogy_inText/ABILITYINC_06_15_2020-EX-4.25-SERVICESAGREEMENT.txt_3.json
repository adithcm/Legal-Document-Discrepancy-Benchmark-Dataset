        "explanation": "The Recitals section introduces both 'Deliverables' and 'Services' but doesn't clearly differentiate them. Later sections only refer to 'Services,' potentially causing confusion as to whether 'Deliverables' are included within the scope of 'Services' or if they are distinct and subject to different obligations. There is no definitions for these terms, and it is unclear whether there is alignment between them.",

        "explanation": "This section has structural flaws in the text, and it does not make sense when reading it. 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' does not form a coherent or grammatically correct sentence. It appears to be missing words or have extraneous words, rendering the intended meaning unclear. The reader is unsure if it is refering to a new effective date or if it is refering to the original effective date.",

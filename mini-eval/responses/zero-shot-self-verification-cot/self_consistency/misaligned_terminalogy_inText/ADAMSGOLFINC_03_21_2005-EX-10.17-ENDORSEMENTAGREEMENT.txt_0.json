(It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. The first sentence states the consultant must exclusively use mandatory products, however, the second sentence states that the consultant can use other clubs that are not Adams Golf clubs. This creates an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses repayment to Adams Golf based on the number of events played. However, all the values for the tournaments and repayment amounts are redacted. This creates a structural flaw as there is no way to know how much the consultant has to pay back to Adams Golf in the scenario that the consultant does not play in a minimum number of tournaments. This makes the contract confusing as the values needed to complete a deal are not present.",

FAILURE TO PLAY Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses the termination of the agreement if the consultant dies or is unable to play golf. It states that repayment should be calculated the same way it is in paragraph 8A. Paragraph 8A refers to the minimum number of tournaments and potential repayment of base compensation, but has values that are all redacted. This references back to paragraph 8A, but because paragraph 8A is missing key values, it creates an omission in text.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that Accuray must accept or reject the Purchase Order within two weeks, with failure to respond counting as disapproval. However, the subsequent sentence contradicts this by stating that each purchase shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This implies that execution is required for acceptance, potentially conflicting with the two-week acceptance/rejection period. It's unclear if a Purchase Order is considered accepted if Accuray doesn't respond within two weeks, or if it always requires execution, creating ambiguity.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction regarding who bears the cost of expedited shipping. The paragraph initially establishes that Accuray will bill actual freight costs to the Distributor. However, it then states that if expedited delivery is needed to meet a delivery deadline at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, Accuray will bear the supplementary costs. But, if the delivery date is not at least six months after submission then the Distributor will bear the costs. This creates an inconsistency because it suggests the distributor pays freight costs but the following sentences provides conditions where the distributor is not to pay the freight costs.",

        "section": "5.4.1.2. Wire Transfer. A wire transfer made in advance of the date payment is due, made in U.S. dollars, to a bank selected by Accuray, according to the following schedule: 5.4.1.2.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 13 5.4.1.2.2. The remaining balance is due net 60 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.",
        "explanation": "The section describes the wire transfer payment schedule. Section 5.4.1.2.1 states the initial payment of US $100,000 must be at least four months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date. The second payment is due net 60 days AFTER delivery. There is no mention of payment being made prior to shipment date for the remaining balance. If the full balance is not due until 60 days after delivery, there is no payment to be made prior to the shipment date, therefore, there is a contradiction within Section 5.4.1.2 as it relates to paying in advance of the shipment date.",

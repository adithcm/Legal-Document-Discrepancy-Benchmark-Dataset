The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section allows Watson to endorse and play another product ([*****]) despite the exclusivity clause in 4A, 4B, and 4C. It references past advertising practices of similarly situated golfers but doesn't clearly define or limit the scope of permissible endorsements. It's unclear what 'executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice' precisely entails, or what actions Watson is obligated to take if the use varies from past practice. This creates ambiguity regarding the extent to which Watson can promote a competing product, leading to potential disputes over what constitutes a violation of the exclusivity agreement.",

        "explanation": "The term 'satisfactory record of play' is not defined within the contract. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine whether CONSULTANT has met the minimum requirement of [*****] events. Without a clear definition, ADAMS GOLF could potentially argue that even if CONSULTANT participates in the required number of events, his performance was not 'satisfactory', triggering the repayment clause. This lack of clarity leaves room for subjective interpretation and potential disputes.",

However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the repayment terms if the consultant doesn't meet the minimum number of tournament appearances. While it specifies a one-month deadline for repayment after the end of the calendar year, it also allows for a 90-day delay in 'certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant' with written notification. The term 'extenuating circumstances' is vague and undefined, granting the consultant considerable discretion to delay payment. This could lead to disputes if Adams Golf disagrees with the consultant's assessment of what constitutes an extenuating circumstance. The phrase 'determined solely by the consultant' creates a loophole where the consultant could potentially delay payment without a valid reason, as long as they provide written notification.",

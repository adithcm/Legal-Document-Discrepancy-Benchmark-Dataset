        "section": "CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the minimum number of tournaments CONSULTANT must participate in and the repayment schedule if the minimum is not met. The first sentence mandates a minimum number of events. The subsequent sentences describe the repayment obligations if this minimum isn't reached, creating a clear cause-and-effect relationship. However, the term 'satisfactory record of play' is ambiguous and undefined. What constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play' is not specified, which means that ADAMS GOLF could argue that the consultant did not play well enough and is in breach of contract. This is an in-text contradiction, because the contract provides the ability for ADAMS GOLF to make up their own conditions on what a 'satisfactory record of play' is.",

        "explanation": "This clause dictates the timeframe for CONSULTANT to provide feedback on ADAMS GOLF's advertising material. However, it stipulates that disapproval must be accompanied by written reasons. If CONSULTANT provides reasons, the clause does not describe a 'reasonable' reason. This provides a loophole for ADAMS GOLF to say that the CONSULTANT is in breach of the contract if ADAMS GOLF deems the reason unreasonable. This is an in-text contradiction, because the contract provides the ability for ADAMS GOLF to make up their own conditions on what a 'reasonable' disapproval reason is.",

However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT.",
        "explanation": "This section deals with termination due to CONSULTANT's inability to play. There is a contradiction in text because it first states that if the inability to play is due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, then no repayment is required. However, the following sentence states that upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. This provides a contradiction, because the contract does not state if the exception is included or not.",

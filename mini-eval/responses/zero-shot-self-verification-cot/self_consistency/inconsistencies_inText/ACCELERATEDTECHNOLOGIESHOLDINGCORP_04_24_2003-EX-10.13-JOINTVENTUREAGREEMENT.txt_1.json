        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture. The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture shall be made.",
        "explanation": "This section grants each Joint Venturer authority to execute instruments related to the Joint Venture's affairs. However, it then places significant restrictions on that authority, requiring written consent from both Joint Venturers for incurring liabilities, disposing of assets, or making purchase commitments. The initial broad grant of authority, followed by these limitations, creates a potential ambiguity. It's unclear what 'instruments of any character' a single Joint Venturer can actually execute without the other's consent. This could lead to disputes about the scope of individual authority.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This clause guarantees PVSS a payment of $10,000 per month regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability, which could be interpreted as a fixed expense that must be paid before any distribution to the Joint Venturers according to their profit sharing interests in Section 6. However, Section 6 states that income and losses shall be shared 50% to CCGI and 50% to PVSS, implying that PVSS should only receive 50% of the profits of the Joint Venture. There is an inconsistency because the guaranteed payment clause suggests that PVSS will receive $10,000 per month regardless of the profitability of the Joint Venture or the stipulations in Section 6, thus creating a potential financial liability for the Joint Venture if CCGI is not paid their share of the profits.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the procedure for termination and liquidation of the Joint Venture. It states that in the event of a dispute regarding asset valuation during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. (CCGI) has the final say on the asset's value. This creates a conflict of interest, especially if CCGI is motivated to undervalue assets to their own benefit during the liquidation process. This gives CCGI an unfair advantage and potentially deprives PVSS of their fair share of the assets.",

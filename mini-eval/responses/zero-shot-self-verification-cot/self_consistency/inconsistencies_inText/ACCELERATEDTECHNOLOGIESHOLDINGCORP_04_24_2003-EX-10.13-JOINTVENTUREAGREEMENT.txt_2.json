        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, Section 9 later mentions \"amount of his contribution\" when discussing interest and withdrawals, implying that contributions do exist. This creates a discrepancy regarding whether capital contributions are actually expected or possible within the Joint Venture.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This clause guarantees a $10,000 monthly payment to PVSS, even if the Joint Venture is not profitable. This contradicts the general principle of a joint venture, where income and losses are typically shared proportionally. It creates a situation where PVSS is essentially receiving a salary or guaranteed return on investment, regardless of the financial performance of the venture. This also has an imbalance, with one party guaranteed income, while the other does not.",

        "explanation": "This statement creates an imbalance of power during liquidation. While Section 6 dictates that income, credits, losses, and deductions are shared 50/50, and Section 11 says all assets should be split pro rata (also 50/50), granting CCGI the final say on asset valuation during a dispute effectively allows them to manipulate the distribution of assets in their favor, potentially contradicting the principle of equal distribution outlined in the previous sections. This can result in CCGI undervaluing the assets.",

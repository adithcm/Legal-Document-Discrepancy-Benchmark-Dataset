        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement of the parties and then states that the agreement will be automatically renewed for another one (1) year if neither party gives notice of non-renewal. These two statements are contradictory. It's unclear whether a mutual written agreement is always needed, or if a lack of notice automatically renews the contract regardless of intent.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow. While the section mentions that the Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow, it does not provide i-Escrow with any recourse if they disagree with the adjustment. Giving one party the unrestricted right to change a fundamental term of the agreement (the payment amount) without the other party's consent or any mechanism for dispute resolution creates an imbalance of power and could be deemed unconscionable under general contract law principles. In some jurisdictions, such a clause might be deemed unenforceable.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory because it first states that section 8.5 (EFFECTS OF TERMINATION) shall not survive expiration or termination of this agreement, but then says that 'even if this agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination'.",

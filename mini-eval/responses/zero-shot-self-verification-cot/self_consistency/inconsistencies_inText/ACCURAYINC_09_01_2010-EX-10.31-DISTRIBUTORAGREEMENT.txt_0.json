        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray. The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address:\n\nAccuray Incorporated\nATTN: Contracts Administration\n1310 Chesapeake Terrace\nSunnyvale, CA 94089\nMain: (408) 716-4600\nFax: (408) 789-4205\nEmail: Orders@accuray.com\n\n2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.3.3 states that Accuray's failure to approve or disapprove a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, Section 2.3.4 allows the Distributor to cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not *executed* it within two weeks. Execution implies a higher level of affirmation than simply 'approving'. This creates a contradiction: Accuray could 'approve' (but not execute) within two weeks, preventing automatic disapproval, yet the Distributor could still cancel because it hasn't been 'executed'.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that Accuray bears expedited shipping costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, Section 3.6 mandates the Distributor to send a Purchase Order at least six months prior to the *expected shipment date*. This creates a contradiction: Section 3.6 dictates a six-month lead time as a requirement, while 4.1.2 makes Accuray responsible for expedited costs only if the deadline *happens* to be six months out. This makes the assignment of expedited shipping cost responsibility ambiguous and contradictory, as the six-month lead time is actually a contractual obligation, not a variable.",

        "section": "4.6. Warranty. 4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.\n\n4.6.2. Hardware and Software. If a Customer notifies Accuray in writing during the Warranty Period of a defect in a Product that causes the Product to fail to conform to the foregoing warranty, Accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non- conforming Product or, if in Accuray's opinion such repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable, Accuray shall refund a pro-rated portion of the price paid by the Customer for such Product calculated based on a straight-line depreciation over a 5-year period beginning on the date of delivery. This will be Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and such Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective Products and parts.",
        "explanation": "Section 4.6.1 defines the Warranty Period as one year following installation, but no more than 18 months after shipment. Section 4.6.2 then describes Accuray's obligations *during* the Warranty Period. However, 4.6.1 *also* states \"Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray\" *except* as set forth in the sentences *before* that disclaimer. Therefore this introduces ambiguity in text and contradiction on the obligations of Accuray for the warranty period.",

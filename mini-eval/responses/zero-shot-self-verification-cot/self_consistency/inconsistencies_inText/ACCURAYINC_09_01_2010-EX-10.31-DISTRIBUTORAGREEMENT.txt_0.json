        "section": "Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if Accuray fails to respond to a purchase order within two weeks, it is considered disapproved. This could be problematic because it doesn't account for situations where Accuray might need more time to properly evaluate the order due to its complexity or other factors. A simple lack of response, for any reason, automatically leads to disapproval, which might not be the intended outcome.",

        "explanation": "While Section 2.4 states that Accuray's standard lead time for delivery is six months, Section 3.6 imposes a requirement on the distributor to submit purchase orders six months prior to the expected shipment date. This doesn't account for potential delays on Accuray's end. If Accuray fails to meet the standard six-month lead time, the distributor's ability to fulfill its obligations could be compromised, even if the distributor submitted the purchase order on time.",

        "explanation": "The warranty period is defined as one year after installation but cannot exceed 18 months after shipment. If the installation is delayed and takes more than 6 months after shipment, the customer will have less than one year of warranty coverage. This discrepancy between installation and shipment dates creates a contradiction in how the warranty period is actually applied and could lead to customer dissatisfaction and disputes.",

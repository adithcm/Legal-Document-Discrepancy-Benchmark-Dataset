        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "Section 4 grants Adams Golf exclusive endorsement rights, preventing the consultant from endorsing competing products (4A, 4B, 4C). However, the subsequent paragraph allows the consultant to endorse [*****], creating a direct conflict. This exception undermines the exclusivity clause and introduces ambiguity. The conditions attached to this exception (consistency with past practices, wearing Adams Golf apparel during [*****] photoshoots, and restrictions on logo placement) further complicate the situation, making it unclear to what extent the consultant can promote [*****] without violating the agreement. The many redactions further add to the ambiguity as to what is being discussed in these clauses.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the MANDATORY PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines a process for the consultant to address dissatisfaction with the mandatory product. It states that if the contract is terminated due to the product being unsuitable, the compensation is prorated from the date of termination. However, it also mentions that the proration is determined using the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A. This is a contradiction because paragraph 8A describes a repayment schedule where the consultant repays Adams Golf, not the other way around. This creates ambiguity about how compensation would be prorated if Adams Golf terminates the agreement due to the product being unsuitable and causes confusion.",

        "section": "MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows: The agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year: 1. Year 1. $[*****] 2. Year 2 $[*****] 3. Year 3 $[*****] 4. Year 4 $[*****] 5. Year 5 $[*****] B.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006. C.In the event that CONSULTANT is prevented from competing for reasons outside his control, the parties agree to a good faith attempt to resolve the issues. If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "Section 8 outlines the minimum number of tournaments the consultant must play and the consequences of not meeting this requirement. However, the term 'satisfactory record of play' is not defined. This ambiguity creates uncertainty because ADAMS GOLF could argue that the consultant did not have a satisfactory record of play even if the minimum number of events was attended. This gives too much discretion to ADAMS GOLF and is open to interpretation. Furthermore, subsection C discusses what would happen if a consultant is unable to compete, but it is vaguely written and provides no real definitive path on how to resolve the conflict. The many redactions in this section further add to the ambiguity as the exact number of tournaments the consultant must play and the agreed upon repayment amounts are not shown.",

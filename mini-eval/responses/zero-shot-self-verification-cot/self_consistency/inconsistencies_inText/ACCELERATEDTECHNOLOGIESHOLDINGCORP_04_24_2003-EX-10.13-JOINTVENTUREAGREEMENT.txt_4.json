        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "This section states that neither joint venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture. However, Section 9 later states that PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability. This is a direct contradiction, as the first statement suggests no compensation, while the second guarantees a monthly payment, which effectively acts as compensation. This creates ambiguity regarding the compensation structure for the Joint Venturers.",

Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "Section 9 stipulates that distributions can only occur if the Joint Venture's assets exceed its liabilities and must be distributed ratably. However, it then states that PVSS is entitled to a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of profitability. This creates a contradiction because the guaranteed payment to PVSS could potentially violate the condition that distributions can only be made if assets exceed liabilities. If the Joint Venture is not profitable or has liabilities exceeding assets, the guaranteed payment to PVSS would contradict the initial distribution clause.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the procedure for asset distribution upon termination, stating that if the parties cannot agree on the value of an asset, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. has the final say. This gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. an unfair advantage and could potentially lead to the undervaluation of assets to their benefit, contradicting the principle of a fair and equal distribution of assets. It biases the liquidation process in favor of one party.",

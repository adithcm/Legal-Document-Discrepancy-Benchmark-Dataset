        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and grammatically incorrect. It includes the word \"Agreement\" twice and does not form a coherent thought. This makes it difficult to understand the intended duration of the agreement.",

(a) As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states that the Recipient will pay the Provider its costs plus a 10% service fee. The term 'actual cost' is ambigious and there is no definition of what that term means. The cost could also include any additional costs that are not stated. This ambiguity could cause in-text contradictions and problems when it comes to payment and determining price.",

Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 3.1, all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section states that section 2.2 will survive termination of the agreement, but this is an in-text contradiction, since 2.2 discusses 'terms of payment and related matters'. Once the agreement is terminated there should be no further payments.",

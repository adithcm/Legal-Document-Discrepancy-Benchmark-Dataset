        "explanation": "The sentence is missing a verb between \"Agreement\" and \"and\". This makes the sentence structurally flawed and difficult to understand. It's unclear what the intended meaning is regarding the agreement's effectiveness.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the \"Terms of Payment and Related Matters\". This includes how Provider will be paid and when the payments will occur. It does not make sense for these obligations to continue after the contract has terminated. If the contract is terminated, there should not be any further payments to Provider, unless the agreement is breached.",

However, the Recipient is defined as \"TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD., a company organized and existing under the laws of Singapore and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel\". This means that at least one party of this agreement is not located in the State of Israel. It may be more appropriate to select Singapore law, because it encompasses at least one party of this agreement.",

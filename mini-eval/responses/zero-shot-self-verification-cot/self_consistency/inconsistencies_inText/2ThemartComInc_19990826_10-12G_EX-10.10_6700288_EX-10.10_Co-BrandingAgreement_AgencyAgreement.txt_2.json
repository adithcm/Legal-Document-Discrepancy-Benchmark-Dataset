        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It states that the agreement may be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then it also says that the agreement will be automatically renewed for another year if neither party provides notice of non-renewal. This creates ambiguity as to how the contract is actually renewed and which term takes precedence.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow. This is a structural flaw because it gives one party complete control over a crucial financial aspect of the agreement without requiring the other party's consent. This could lead to unreasonable adjustments and disputes, making the agreement unfair and unbalanced.",

        "section": "8.5 EFFECTS OF TERMINATION. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section states that 'Sections 1, 7, 8.5, 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.' However, it also states that 'all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination.' This creates an inconsistency because the survival clause for pending transactions could require relying on provisions that are explicitly stated not to survive (e.g., definitions in Section 1, disclaimer of warranties in Section 7, indemnity in Section 9, etc.). This contradiction could lead to disputes about the extent to which the agreement remains in effect during the wind-down period.",

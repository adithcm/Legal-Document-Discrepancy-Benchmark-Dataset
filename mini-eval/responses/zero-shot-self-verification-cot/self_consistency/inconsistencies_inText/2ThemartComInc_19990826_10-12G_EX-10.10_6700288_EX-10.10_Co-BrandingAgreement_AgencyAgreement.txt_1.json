        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence of Section 8.1 states that the agreement will automatically renew for another year if neither party provides notice of non-renewal. This contradicts the earlier statement that renewal requires mutual written agreement. An automatic renewal clause negates the need for mutual agreement, creating an inconsistency.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Section 5.1 allows 2TheMart to unilaterally change the advertising fee rate paid by i-Escrow without requiring i-Escrow's consent. This could be deemed unconscionable under general contract law principles, especially if the adjusted rate is unreasonable or not reflective of market conditions. The clause lacks safeguards to protect i-Escrow from arbitrary or excessive rate increases, potentially making it unenforceable or subject to challenge. Most jurisdictions require good faith and fair dealing, which could be argued as being violated by this unilateral adjustment clause.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 8.5 states that certain sections (1,7,8.5,9,10,11,12) shall not survive expiration or termination of this agreement. However, Section 8.5 itself is listed as a section that does not survive termination. This creates a logical contradiction, as the very terms dictating what happens upon termination are stated to not survive termination.",

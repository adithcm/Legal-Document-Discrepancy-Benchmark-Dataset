The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****].

The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section grants the consultant the right to endorse other products which may constitute a conflict of interest. The consultant may endorse and play other products, but cannot display other company logos on ADAMS GOLF products. This creates an Inconsistency because section 4A, 4B, and 4C state that the consultant shall not endorse any other product, but this section states that the consultant is able to.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT: A.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude, B.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community, D.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT. ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
        "explanation": "The language in this section regarding what constitutes grounds for termination is vague and subjective ('public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community'). What one party considers 'offensive' another may not. Also, the clause requiring ADAMS GOLF to exercise its right to terminate within 90 days of becoming aware of the conduct is somewhat ambiguous. It is not clear WHO in senior management must be aware. This can lead to disputes.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the consequences of termination due to the consultant's inability to play golf. It states that the consultant or their estate must repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed portion of the agreement, UNLESS the inability to play is due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event. This creates an in-text contradiction with Section 23, which states that a consultant only needs to repay ADAMS GOLF if ADAMS GOLF does not consistently provide adequate product. This implies that ADAMS GOLF would need to continue to compensate the consultant even if the consultant can no longer provide service.",

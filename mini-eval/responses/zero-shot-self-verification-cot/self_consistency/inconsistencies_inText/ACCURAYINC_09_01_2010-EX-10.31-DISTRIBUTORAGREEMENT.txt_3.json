        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an ambiguity in text regarding the acceptance of a Purchase Order. Initially, it states that Accuray must either accept or reject a Purchase Order within two weeks, with failure to respond counting as disapproval. However, it then adds that each purchase shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This creates confusion: Does the two-week acceptance/rejection period still apply, or does acceptance solely rely on the execution of the Purchase Order? The term \"may be accepted\" is also ambiguous. It is unclear if execution of the Purchase Order is mandatory for acceptance, or if it is optional and another form of acceptance is available.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency in text regarding responsibility for expedited shipping costs. The text states that Accuray will pay supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery if the requested delivery date is at least six months after the purchase order submission. However, the following example contradicts this rule. If the purchase order was submitted June 1 with the requested delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months later), Accuray would bear the cost. However, if the requested delivery date was October 1 (less than six months later), the distributor would bear the cost. The rule should state \"more than six months\" to not contradict the rule in the example. Therefore, this creates ambiguity because the text and example create uncertainty about when Accuray is financially responsible for expedited shipping. ",

A wire transfer made in advance of the date payment is due, made in U.S. dollars, to a bank selected by Accuray, according to the following schedule: \n5.4.1.2.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 13 5.4.1.2.2. The remaining balance is due net 60 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.",
        "explanation": "Section 5.4.1.2 describes payment via wire transfer. The initial $100,000 is due upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, at least four months before shipment. The remaining balance is due net 60 days after delivery. This could be interpreted as a contradiction because the first payment is due 4 months before shipment and the second payment is due 60 days after shipment, leading to the argument that the last payment is not being paid in advance. The phrase \"in advance of the date payment is due\" makes the payment schedule seem contradictory.",

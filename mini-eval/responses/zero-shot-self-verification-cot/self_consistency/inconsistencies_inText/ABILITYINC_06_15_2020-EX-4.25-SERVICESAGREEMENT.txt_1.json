        "section": "This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",
        "explanation": "The sentence structure is flawed and unclear. It seems to be missing a verb after 'Agreement' and the repetition of the word 'Agreement' makes it nonsensical. It's difficult to understand the intended meaning regarding the agreement's term and termination. The grammar does not make sense and the sentence should be rewritten.",

        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section seems to explicitly state that Provider Representatives will ONLY provide services to the Recipient. However, this contradicts the language in Section 2.2(a) which states 'Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee'. This discrepancy lies in the language of 'actual cost'. If the Representatives are dedicated SOLELY to the Recipient then there is no cost to the Provider and there should be no cost for the Recipient to cover other than the 10% service fee. 'Actual Cost' implies there is some cost to the Provider. This creates an ambiguity around what 'actual cost' means, and how labor is covered in the cost of services.",

        "section": "This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby and/or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the Parties, whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Israel (including in respect of the statute of limitations or other limitations period applicable to any such claim, controversy or dispute), without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Israel or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Israel.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that Israeli law governs the contract. However, the Recipient is defined as 'TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD., a company organized and existing under the laws of Singapore and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel'. This creates a potential conflict because one of the recipient companies is based in Singapore. If a dispute involves the Singaporean company, it might be argued that Singaporean law should apply, especially if the activities related to the dispute occurred in Singapore or involved Singaporean assets. The provision should consider the potential for disputes involving both entities and clarify how the governing law applies in such situations to avoid ambiguity and potential legal challenges. Furthermore, the choice of law may be limited or superseded by mandatory rules and regulations of Singapore (where one of the Recipient parties is incorporated), especially regarding matters of public policy or jurisdiction.",

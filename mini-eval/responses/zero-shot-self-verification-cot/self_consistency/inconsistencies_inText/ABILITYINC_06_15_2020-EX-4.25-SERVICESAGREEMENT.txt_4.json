        "section": "This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",
        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and does not make sense, and has multiple issues. Firstly, there's a grammatical error with \"This Agreement be deemed effective\". Secondly, the sentence includes the word \"Agreement\" twice which appears to be a typo or an error in drafting. This error is a significant structural flaw that impacts the clarity of the contract, because it is unclear if the effective date is different than the termination date.",

        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an in-text contradiction because, under section 1.2(e), the Provider is allowed to use subcontractors to provide the services. If the Provider uses subcontractors, the subcontractors would not be solely dedicated to providing services to the Recipient, thus creating an in-text contradiction.",

In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous in text because it states that Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. It is unclear if the 10% service fee also applies to the out-of-pocket costs. If the 10% service fee applies to the out-of-pocket costs, then it must be explicitly stated. The missing clarification creates an ambiguity in text.",

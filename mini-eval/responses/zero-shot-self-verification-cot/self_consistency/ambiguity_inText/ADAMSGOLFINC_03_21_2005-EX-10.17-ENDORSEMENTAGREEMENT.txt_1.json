        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the minimum number of tournaments the Consultant must participate in and the repayment schedule if they fail to meet that minimum. The contradiction lies in the ambiguity of what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play.' Without a clear, objective definition, it is unclear how Adams Golf would determine whether the Consultant has met the minimum requirement, which can lead to disputes over repayment.",

        "section": "14. INDEMNITY\nCONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction. Initially, it states that the Consultant indemnifies Adams Golf from all expenses related to breaches, *excluding* attorney's fees. However, the subsequent sentence states that Adams Golf *will* cover the Consultant's attorney's fees, up to $10,000. This creates ambiguity regarding responsibility for attorney's fees, making the provision contradictory. Is the Consultant responsible for all attorney fees up to 10k, or is Adams Golf? And who is responsible for the amount that exceeds 10k?",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. It states that if the consultant dies or is unable to play tour golf, Adams Golf can terminate the agreement, and that the consultant or their estate must repay Adams Golf for the unperformed period, calculated using the formula in 8A. However, Section 8A outlines a schedule for *repayment* by the consultant if they fail to play a minimum number of tournaments within a calendar year. Applying that repayment calculation to a situation where the consultant dies or becomes permanently disabled is misaligned and does not account for that ADAMS GOLF would no longer have to pay for the consultant, effectively getting paid twice, which is unreasonable, especially in the case of death or disability.",

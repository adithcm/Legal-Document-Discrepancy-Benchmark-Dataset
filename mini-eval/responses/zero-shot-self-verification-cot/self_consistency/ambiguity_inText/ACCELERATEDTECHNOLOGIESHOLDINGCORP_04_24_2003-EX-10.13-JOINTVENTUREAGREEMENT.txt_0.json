Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates two different ways of distributing assets during the termination of the Joint Venture. Any unexpended funds will be distributed by prorata ownership, while all other assets are distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. This contradiction can lead to confusion and disagreements during termination.",

Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture, even those instruments that could incur liability or indebtedness for borrowed funds, dispose of assets, or purchase any items for the Joint Venture. The need for written consent or approval is only required for strategic partnerships with other organizations.",
        "explanation": "This section grants either Joint Venturer the authority to execute instruments that could incur liability or indebtedness for borrowed funds, dispose of assets, or purchase any items for the Joint Venture, without specifying any limitations or approval processes (except for strategic partnerships). This broad and unrestricted power could potentially expose the Joint Venture to financial risks or liabilities without proper oversight or consensus between the parties.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and potential inconsistency. While it allows Watson to endorse another product ([*****]), it lacks specific details about the extent and limitations of this endorsement, especially concerning advertising practices. The language regarding 'past advertising practice' is vague and could lead to disputes over what constitutes acceptable use of Watson's name and likeness. The redactions make it difficult to assess the full scope of the allowed endorsement and its potential conflict with the exclusivity clauses.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency regarding attorney's fees. The first sentence states that the consultant is responsible for all expenses, which would include attorney's fees, but it is then immediately contradicted by the second sentence, which states that Adams Golf will cover attorney's fees up to $10,000. The discrepancy lies in whether or not the consultant is responsible for attorney's fees, creating confusion.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a potential contradiction. While it allows Adams Golf to terminate the agreement if the consultant dies or is unable to play golf, it also requires the consultant's estate to repay Adams Golf for the period of the agreement not performed. It doesn't seem logical to ask the consultant's estate to repay if the consultant dies, especially when the consultant can no longer perform the agreement.",

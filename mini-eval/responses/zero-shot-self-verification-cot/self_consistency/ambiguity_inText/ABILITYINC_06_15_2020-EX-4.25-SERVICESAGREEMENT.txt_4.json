Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity. On one hand, it states that Provider Representatives shall be solely dedicated to providing services to the Recipient, implying they cannot work for any other customer of Provider. However, Section 1.1(a) states that Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible. This implies that Provider's resources may be used elsewhere.",

        "section": "Provider shall allow the Recipient to use [ * * * ] at no cost, until December 31, 2021.",
        "explanation": "While not strictly a contradiction, it is an omission that creates a potential loophole.  The contract does not define what happens to the Recipient's use of [ * * * ] after December 31, 2021.  Does the Recipient lose access?  Does a fee then apply?  The omission of this information creates ambiguity and potential for dispute. Also, earlier in the document in section 3.1, it states that this agreement shall terminate on December 31, 2020, so this agreement is valid a whole year after the termination date.",

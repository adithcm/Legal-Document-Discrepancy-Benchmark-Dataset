        "section": "Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing services to Recipient. However, Section 1.1(a) allows Provider not to respond to requests for additional services not contemplated in Exhibit A, which could lead to a situation where the Recipient requires additional support, and the Provider Representatives, despite being dedicated, might not be obligated to fulfill those needs, creating a contradiction in the expected service level.",

        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and grammatically incorrect. It is missing a verb, and it also says, 'Effective Date, Agreement'. It should probably say something like, 'This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall terminate on December 31, 2020'.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters.' Including the entirety of this section as surviving termination introduces a contradiction. While ensuring payment for services rendered makes sense, including clauses like 2.2(c), which states 'Provider shall allow the Recipient to use [ * * * ] at no cost, until December 31, 2021,' creates an obligation that extends beyond the termination date (December 31, 2020) as stated in Section 3.1. It's unclear if this free usage should continue even after the agreement terminates.",

        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, it doesn't explicitly address how the initial operational expenses or potential losses will be covered if no capital is contributed. This creates ambiguity regarding the financial stability and operational funding of the joint venture, especially in its initial stages. It is unclear how the Joint Venture will be able to function properly if each party is not required to invest any capital.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture, even those instruments that could incur liability or indebtedness for borrowed funds, dispose of assets, or purchase any items for the Joint Venture. The need for written consent or approval is only required for strategic partnerships with other organizations.",
        "explanation": "This section grants each Joint Venturer broad authority to act on behalf of the Joint Venture, including incurring debt and disposing of assets, without requiring consent from the other Joint Venturer. This is a significant contradiction because it essentially allows one Joint Venturer to unilaterally make decisions that could drastically impact the financial stability and future of the Joint Venture, even to the detriment of the other Joint Venturer. It is not clarified what constitutes a strategic partnership which makes the clause ambiguious. Without some provisions for checks and balances, this is a contradiction because it gives one party the power to tank the business.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the procedure for termination and liquidation. It states that debts are paid or provided for reasonably, unexpended funds are distributed according to ownership percentages, and all other assets are distributed at the discretion of a third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' pro-rata interests. This creates a contradiction because the Joint Venturers own a percentage of the business, but a third-party mediator can dispose of all assets without honoring those percentages which means a Joint Venturer could be unfairly treated.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever practical. The decision on whether to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT in a specific tournament will be at the sole discretion of the CONSULTANT based on performance considerations. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section presents an in-text contradiction. While the CONSULTANT is expected to exclusively use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, the contract acknowledges that the CONSULTANT may use clubs from other manufacturers, including a putter, as long as they do not endorse them. This creates a contradiction since it's difficult to separate 'using' a product from implicitly endorsing it, especially in a professional setting where product usage is highly visible and scrutinized.",

        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\n\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n\n1.  Year 1. $[*****]\n2.  Year 2 $[*****]\n3.  Year 3 $[*****]\n4.  Year 4 $[*****]\n5.  Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "This section contains ambiguity in text. The term \"satisfactory record of play\" is not defined. Without a clear definition of what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play,' it is left to subjective interpretation, potentially leading to disputes between the parties regarding whether the CONSULTANT has met the minimum tournament requirement. The lack of clarity on this point creates the potential for conflicting understandings and enforcement challenges. What metrics are used to determine 'satisfactory'? Does simply participating count, or must there be a certain level of performance (e.g., making the cut, finishing within a certain percentile)?",

INDEMNITY CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an in-text contradiction. The first sentence states that the CONSULTANT is responsible for all liability, claims, etc. excluding attorney fees and expenses. However, the second sentence contradicts the first by saying ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000. Does this mean that CONSULTANT is responsible for any attorney fees above the initial $10,000?",

        "section": "CUSTOMERS means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous because it requires users to complete 'at least one transaction per month' to be considered a customer. This is an unrealistic and confusing requirement, because users are considered customers even if they don't make a single transaction. This definition contradicts the common understanding of a customer as someone who makes a purchase or uses a service. It also creates confusion about how 'advertising fees' are calculated in Section 5.1.",

        "explanation": "This sentence is a structural flaw because of the term Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 being randomly in the middle of the sentnece and making it so that the sentence is not structured properly and does not make sense.",

In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "This contains inconsistencies in text because the same sentence is repeated twice, which implies there are two different actions that need to be done when in reality there is only one. The duplication of the statement creates an unnecessary repetition and does not make sense from a structural or legal perspective.",

        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Distributor\" includes both Siemens and any third party granted distribution rights by Siemens. This creates a potential contradiction. If Siemens is always the Distributor, then the need for Siemens to grant distribution rights to a Third Party becomes unclear. This is because Siemens cannot grant distribution rights to itself. The intention is to define Siemens and its subsidiaries to be distributors, and also other distributors appointed by Siemens to also be distributors, but this needs to be structured better. As is, this definition introduces ambiguity in the contract.",

        "section": "3.6. Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines two different contractual relationships, then stipulates that the Purchase Order must be sent to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. It is implied that this timeline is for the sale of Products. However, it's unclear what role the six-month lead time plays when the Service Agreement is between Accuray and the Customer. It is possible that in some instances that only a service agreement is being offered and the 6 month timeline does not make sense in this instance.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section states that Accuray bears the supplementary shipping costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, it later provides an example where if a Purchase Order is submitted on June 1 with a requested delivery date of December 1, Accuray bears the expenses. This example contradicts the initial statement because December 1 is exactly six months after June 1, not 'at least' six months. It creates ambiguity and would be up for interpretation.",

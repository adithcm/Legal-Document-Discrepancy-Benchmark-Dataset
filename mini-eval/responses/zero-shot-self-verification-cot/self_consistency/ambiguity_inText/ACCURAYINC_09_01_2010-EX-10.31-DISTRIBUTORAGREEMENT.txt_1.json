        "section": "1.3.  \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "This definition allows Siemens to grant distribution rights to any third party, potentially creating a conflict of interest or diluting the exclusivity that Accuray might expect. This is because Accuray appointed Siemens as the distributor and didn't expect Siemens to appoint another distributor, unless negotiated or agreed upon.",

Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. By way of clarification, this Agreement does not relate to any Cayman Product, including, without limitation, the distribution or sale thereof or any services related thereto.",
        "explanation": "The statement that Accuray appoints the distributor as a \"non-exclusive, worldwide distributor...not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors\" creates ambiguity. While Accuray retains the right to distribute its products, the extent to which this right can be exercised without undermining the distributor's efforts is unclear. This is more apparent as they are multiple distributorships.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency regarding responsibility for expedited shipping costs. It states that Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, it then uses an example where a June 1 submission with a December 1 delivery date (exactly six months) results in Accuray bearing the costs, while an October 1 delivery date results in the Distributor bearing the costs. This implies that exactly six months qualifies for Accuray's responsibility, creating confusion about whether \"at least\" includes the exact six-month mark.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous and could lead to disputes. The phrase 'complete at least one transaction per month' is unclear. Does this mean one transaction within the Co-Branded Site each month? Or any transaction, regardless of where it occurs, as long as the user accesses the Co-Branded Site? This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine who qualifies as a 'Customer' and affects calculations related to advertising fees and reporting. The term should be explicitly defined.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The duplication of the sentence 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect' is a structural flaw and does not read correctly. It also doesn't add anything to the contents of the document.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "This section contains ambiguity in the text. The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' is vague and unclear. The standard for when one party would be 'deemed a principal' of the other is not defined within the agreement, making the scope of the indemnification obligation uncertain. This is ambiguous because it's unclear what specific circumstances would trigger this principal-agent relationship, thus creating a limitation on the indemnification that's hard to interpret.",

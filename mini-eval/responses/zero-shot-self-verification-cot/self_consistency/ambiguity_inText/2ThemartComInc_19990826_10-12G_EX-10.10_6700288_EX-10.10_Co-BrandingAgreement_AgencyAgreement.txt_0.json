        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity regarding termination rights. It states that if the Launch Date doesn't occur within 4 months, either party *may* terminate. However, it then adds a condition: only the party who used good faith efforts can terminate. This implies that if *neither* party used good faith efforts, *neither* can terminate, even if the 4-month deadline is missed. This contradicts the initial statement that *either* party can terminate after 4 months, regardless of effort level. It's unclear what happens if both parties fail to use good faith efforts, leading to potential disputes.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The section on Advertising Fees is ambiguous. It states that the advertising fee is calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average transaction. It does not clearly specify if 0.025% is the fee per Transaction Inquiry, or if it is a factor used to derive a per Transaction Inquiry rate. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual calculation of the advertising fees and could lead to disputes.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "There is a clear inconsistency due to a duplicate sentence. The sentence 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect' is repeated, which adds no value and could indicate a drafting error.",

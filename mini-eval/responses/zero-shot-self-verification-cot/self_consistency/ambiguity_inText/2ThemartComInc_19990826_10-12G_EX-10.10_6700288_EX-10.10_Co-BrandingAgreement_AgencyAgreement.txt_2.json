        "section": "1. DEFINITIONS. (c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Customers\" requires them to complete at least one transaction *per month*. This sets a recurring activity requirement for a user to be considered a \"Customer.\" However, the agreement later calculates advertising fees based on the number of 'Transaction Inquiries' from Customers (Section 5.1). This implies that someone who was once a 'Customer' but did not complete a transaction in a subsequent month could still generate transaction inquiries that incur advertising fees. This creates ambiguity because the definition suggests a continuously active user base, while the payment terms do not explicitly address users who cease to meet the monthly transaction requirement but still generate inquiries.",

In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "The clause states that if the Launch Date doesn't occur within 4 months, either party may terminate the agreement. However, it adds a condition: If only one party used good faith and reasonable development efforts, *only that party* may terminate. This introduces a contradiction. The first sentence grants termination rights to 'either party' under a specific condition (delay). The second sentence then restricts this right, granting it only to the diligent party. This creates uncertainty. What happens if neither party uses good faith?",

        "section": "7. CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the MANDATORY PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "Section 7 discusses termination due to the consultant's dissatisfaction with mandatory products. It states that if the contract is terminated under this clause, the compensation due to the consultant will be prorated and determined based on the repayment schedule outlined in paragraph 8A. This is misaligned because paragraph 8A discusses repayment *by* the consultant to Adams Golf if the consultant doesn't meet the minimum number of tournaments. This means the repayment schedule refers to situations where the consultant is penalized, not where the consultant is due compensation upon termination due to product dissatisfaction. It's an in-text contradiction because the referenced section does not apply to the scenario described.",

        "section": "14. INDEMNITY CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "In Section 14, CONSULTANT agrees to indemnify ADAMS GOLF for all liabilities, claims, etc., excluding attorney fees and expenses. However, the immediately following sentence contradicts this by stating that ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000. This is a direct in-text contradiction as the initial clause excludes attorney fees from indemnification, but the subsequent clause agrees to cover them up to a certain limit.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Section 22 outlines the process for termination should the CONSULTANT die or be unable to play tour golf. It stipulates that in such an event, the consultant (or estate) is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unfulfilled portion of the agreement, calculated as per paragraph 8A. However, paragraph 8A concerns repayments *from* the CONSULTANT to ADAMS GOLF should the CONSULTANT not play enough tournaments. It doesn't logically follow that the CONSULTANT would 'repay' for not being able to play due to death or inability; there would be no basis for calculating repayment under 8A in such a circumstance. The reference to 8A is an in-text contradiction as the context of 8A is completely different from the circumstances described in Section 22.",

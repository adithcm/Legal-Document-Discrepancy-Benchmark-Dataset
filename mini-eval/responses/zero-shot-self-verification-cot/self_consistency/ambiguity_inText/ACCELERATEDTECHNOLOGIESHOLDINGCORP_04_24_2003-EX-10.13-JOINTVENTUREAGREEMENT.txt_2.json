        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, the success of a joint venture typically relies on some level of initial investment or resource commitment from both parties. Leaving this entirely open-ended creates uncertainty and potential for one party to contribute significantly less, undermining the venture's potential success. This can also be used to say that one party doesn't have to contribute at all, which could lead to legal action. Because this is in text and is not a legal term, it creates an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the third-party mediator shall determine the fair price and decide which party receives the asset, potentially offsetting balances to ensure fair distribution, as determined by the mediator.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction in the distribution of assets upon termination. While unexpended funds are distributed according to the parties' ownership percentages, all other assets are distributed at the sole discretion of a third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' ownership interests. This disparity is a structural flaw. It also creates potential disputes, as it allows for a distribution of assets that is completely disproportionate to the agreed-upon ownership division in Section 6, which states a 50/50 split. This is a structural flaw in text because it does not make sense to have two different ways to split everything at the end of the Joint Venture.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers agree and declare that this association for the carrying on of a joint venture business operation does not, and is not intended to create a partnership, for either legal or United States income tax purposes, each Party recognizing that the other is willing and able to contribute capital, labor, and services for the operation of a successful joint venture business. Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation. The Parties also declare that they are not making any agreement to undertake any business other than that set forth in this Agreement; and nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation of the powers or rights of either Party to carry on his separate business for his sole benefit; provided, however, the Parties shall cooperate with each other according to the terms and spirit of this Agreement in the performance of their joint venture business operation.",
        "explanation": "While aiming to avoid partnership classification for tax purposes, the language in this section is structurally flawed. The text says that both parties need to cooperate with each other to continue the business operations, but it does not make sense to say that both parties need to 'carry on his separate business for his sole benefit' when the two businesses are working together. This presents confusion as to what the purpose of the Joint Venture is and if it's to benefit both parties or if one party is going to continue to benefit from their own individual business. This presents a structural flaw within the legal terms used.",

        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a conditional termination clause based on the Launch Date not occurring within 4 months of the Effective Date (June 21, 1999). However, it adds a caveat that *only* the party who has used 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' can exercise the termination right. This creates ambiguity. What constitutes 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' is not defined, and there is no mechanism for determining whether each party has met this standard. It's possible one party claims to have used such efforts, while the other disagrees, leading to a dispute about the right to terminate. It is also not clear how this determination would be made (e.g., through an independent arbiter?).",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The method for calculating the advertising fees due to 2TheMart is ambiguous and potentially unworkable. The fee is based on 0.025% of the 'average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter.' The term 'Customers' is defined in Section 1(c) as users who complete at least one transaction *per month*. This means the 'average Transaction' is based on a very specific subset of users (those consistently making monthly transactions), and may not be representative of all transactions initiated through the Co-Branded Site. This definition could drastically skew the calculated advertising fees, and may lead to disputes over the 'true' average transaction value, especially if the parties have differing interpretations or data on transaction volumes.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The repeated sentence 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect' is a structural flaw because it repeats itself and adds nothing to the contract.",

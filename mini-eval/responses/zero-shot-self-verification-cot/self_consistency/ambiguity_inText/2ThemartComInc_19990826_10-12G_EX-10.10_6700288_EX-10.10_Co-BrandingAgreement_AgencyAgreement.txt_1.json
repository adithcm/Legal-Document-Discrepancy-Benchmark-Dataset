        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction because it suggests that only the party who used 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' can terminate the agreement if the launch date is not achieved within 4 months. However, the previous sentence states 'either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice' if the launch date isn't met. This creates an inconsistency in who has the right to terminate, depending on the effort put forth. It is unclear if both parties have to use good faith and reasonable development efforts to be able to terminate the contract if the launch date hasn't happened, or if only one party doesn't use good faith and reasonable development efforts then only the other party can terminate the contract. This creates an ambiguity and contradiction.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The repetition of the sentence 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.' is a structural flaw in text. It is not clear why the sentence has been repeated, which creates confusion. This could be an editing error.",

        "explanation": "There is an omission in text within the Indemnity section. The fullstop/period is missing from the end of the third sentence, which creates a structural flaw. There is also a source code within the text 'Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999' which creates a structural flaw as it's in the middle of a sentence.",

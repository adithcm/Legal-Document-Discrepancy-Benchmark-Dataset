        "explanation": "This definition is ambiguous because it doesn't clarify the relationship and obligations between Siemens, its Affiliates, and Third Parties granted distribution rights. It's unclear whether all entities falling under this definition have the same rights and responsibilities or if Siemens retains specific control over its Affiliates and Third Parties. The lack of clarity could lead to disputes over liability, performance, and adherence to the agreement's terms.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"to the best of Accuray's knowledge\" introduces ambiguity. It's unclear what happens if Accuray's knowledge is inaccurate and the actual lead time is longer. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes if Accuray fails to meet the six-month lead time, and it claims it was due to unforeseen circumstances outside its current knowledge.",

For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that the Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. However, section 4.1.2 states that expedited shipping costs will be covered by Accuray if a purchase order was submitted at least six months prior to the delivery date. This contradicts the six-month timeline because expedited deliveries may still be required.",

If Women.com does not deliver the shortfall within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, eDiets may terminate this Agreement in its entirety immediately or authorize Women.com to deliver the shortfall within an extended number of days to be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the \"Make Good Period\"). Should eDiets elect to terminate this Agreement, Women.com shall reimburse eDiets within thirty (30) days of the date of such termination for all pre-paid impressions or other promotions not delivered as of the date of termination. Women.com agrees that if eDiets elects to extend the Agreement the monthly fee due and payable during the Make Good Period will be recalculated and reduced to reflect the changes in the revised delivery schedule.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the consequences of Women.com failing to meet the guaranteed advertising impressions. It states that if Women.com doesn't deliver at least 80% of the guaranteed impressions, eDiets has the option to terminate the agreement, and Women.com will reimburse eDiets for pre-paid impressions not delivered within thirty (30) days of the date of such termination. It also states that Women.com agrees that if eDiets elects to extend the Agreement the monthly fee due and payable during the Make Good Period will be recalculated and reduced to reflect the changes in the revised delivery schedule. This section doesn't give enough information about what will happen to monthly fee if eDiets terminates the agreement. ",

        "explanation": "The last sentence of this section states, \"This agreement will only renew if both parties provide written consent no more than thirty (30) days prior to the termination date.\" This language is ambiguous. Does it mean that the written consent has to be provided within 30 days of the termination date, or more than 30 days prior to the termination date? ",

Following the Initial Term, Women.com shall have the right, upon no fewer than sixty (60) days prior written notice to eDiets, to increase the amount of the Payment Schedule provided, that (i) Women.com may not increase the Payment Schedule more than once in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months and (ii) such increase may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the then current Payment Schedule.",
        "explanation": "This section appears to only address payment increases following the initial term, and it doesn't explicitly state what would happen to the price if the agreement were to extend, but there were no changes made. The omission of this piece of information can be inferred by most as the pricing would be the same, but it would be more clear to specify what the price would be if there are no changes made to the payment schedule.

        "explanation": "The date 'November 1, 2010' is in the past relative to the agreement date of 'October 30, 2018'. This clause is either a typo or irrelevant, as the condition would have already been evaluated. This creates ambiguity as to the actual intent and enforceability of this clause. It is likely that the year is incorrect. This should likely be 2019.",

Ehave shall not refuse to accept a CHT Change request unless it is unable to make the Change requested using commercially reasonable efforts, in which event Ehave will provide an explanation to CHT or Ehave and CHT fail to agree on the terms and conditions related to the performance of such Change, including the costs, if any.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency. It first states that changes are subject to acceptance testing by CHT before deployment. Then, it says Ehave shall not refuse to accept a CHT Change request under certain conditions. However, acceptance testing is CHT's prerogative, not Ehave's. The two sentences are misaligned, implying Ehave is responsible for change acceptance when it should be CHT.",

        "explanation": "This warranty provides that the documentation will be 'complete and accurate in all material respects' and that the solution will not contain any 'material undocumented feature'. This is vague, creating ambiguity as to what constitutes a 'material' feature or a 'material respect'. This allows for subjective interpretation, weakening the warranty.",

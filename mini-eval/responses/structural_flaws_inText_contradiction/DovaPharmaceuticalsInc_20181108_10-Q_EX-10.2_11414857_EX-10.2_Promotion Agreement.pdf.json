        "section": "Valeant shall use only Product Materials approved by Dova in the performance of Valeant Activities under this Agreement provided, however, that Valeant shall not be required to use any Product Materials that have not been approved by Valeant or which have not incorporated comments provided by Valeant and nothing herein shall require Valeant to use all Product Materials created or prepared by Dova and Valeant reserves the right not to use certain Product Materials.",
        "explanation": "This is a contradiction because it states that Valeant shall use Product Materials approved by Dova, but then states they are not required to use any product materials that have not been approved by Valeant. This creates ambiguity as to whose product materials are required to be used.",

THE FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT (1) THE OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FROM AND AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.1 OR 11.2, AS APPLICABLE, OR (2) DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTYS BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE OBLIGATIONS IN ARTICLE 9.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of this section states that neither party shall be liable to the other for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, punitive or exemplary damages. The second sentence states that the foregoing sentence shall not limit damages available for a party's breach of the confidentiality and non-use obligations in Article 9. This is a contradiction, as it first limits certain damages then removes said limitation.",

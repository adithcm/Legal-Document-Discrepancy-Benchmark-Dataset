        "section": "5. Exclusivity on Registered Referrals and Opportunities. During the Term hereof and for a period of six (6) months following the termination of this Agreement or the discontinuation of any of the Company Products, (i) the Reseller shall have the exclusive right to commission for any Registered Referrals, (ii) the Company shall not market, promote, sell, or distribute Company Products or solicit or procure orders for the Company Products, or for any product(s) or service(s) similar to the Company Products, in the Territory other than through the Reseller and pursuant to this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Reseller, and (iii) without limitation to the foregoing, the Company shall not, directly or through other parties (whether agents, representatives, intermediaries, resellers or other parties), market, promote, sell, distribute, solicit or procure orders to any existing or prospective customer of the Reseller.",
        "explanation": "Section 5 grants the Reseller exclusive rights to commissions and prohibits the Company from marketing or selling directly in the territory or to the Reseller's customers. However, it also states this exclusivity applies \u201cpursuant to this Agreement\u201d. This creates an ambiguity because if the agreement is followed strictly, there shouldn't be a scenario where the Company is marketing or selling directly, making the exclusivity clause somewhat redundant and confusing. The phrase \u201cpursuant to this Agreement\u201d weakens the exclusivity granted.",

RESELLER SHALL MAKE NO REPRESENTATION, GUARANTEE, OR WARRANTY CONCERNING THE COMPANY PRODUCT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED IN ADVANCE BY COMPANY IN WRITING. TO THE EXTENT THE RESELLER HAS COMPLIED WITH THE OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE COMPANY SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE RESELLER FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE RESELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES (WHETHER DIRECTLY OR IN CONNECTION WITH A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY) AS A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RESELLER SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES (WHETHER DIRECTLY OR IN CONNECTION WITH A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY) AS A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESELLERS ACTIVITIES.",
        "explanation": "This section contains inconsistent responsibilities and liabilities. The first part states the Reseller is responsible for warranty claims if not authorized by the Company in writing. The second part, 'TO THE EXTENT THE RESELLER HAS COMPLIED WITH THE OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE COMPANY SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE RESELLER FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE RESELLER' creates an inconsistency by implying that the Reseller could be held liable for a warranty if they don't comply with this section. Then it switches and says the Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Reseller, and also says the Reseller will indemnify and hold harmless the Company. This is not a clear and aligned statement. It is contradicting itself.",

        "explanation": "This section limits the Reseller's liability to the Company for losses resulting from Company Products, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence. This is inconsistent with Section 13, which requires the Reseller to indemnify the Company for losses arising out of the Reseller's activities. The inconsistency lies in that Section 13 doesn't have the same limitation (willful misconduct or gross negligence). This creates ambiguity regarding the Reseller's overall liability.",

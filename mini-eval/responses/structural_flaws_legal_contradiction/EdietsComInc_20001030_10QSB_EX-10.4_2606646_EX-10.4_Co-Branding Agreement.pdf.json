        "section": "If Women.com does not deliver at least 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Advertsing Promotions as set forth on Exhibit B (11,250,000 per quarter 45,000,000 per year) 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for the Diet Center Logo as set forth on Exhibit B (3,250,000 per quarter 13,000,000 per year) and 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Other Campaigns as set forth on Exhibit B (3,000,000 per quarter 12,000,000 per year) each quarter following the Launch Date, within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, Women.com shall deliver an amount equal to the under-delivery within the same campaign elements, including newsletters, promotions, exclusive sponsorships, targeted rotations, ROS, channel and sub-channel center logo placements, or mutually agreed upon comparable elements. If Women.com does not deliver the shortfall within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, eDiets may terminate this Agreement in its entirety immediately or authorize Women.com to deliver the shortfall within an extended number of days to be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the \"Make Good Period\"). Should eDiets elect to terminate this Agreement, Women.com shall reimburse eDiets within thirty (30) days of the date of such termination for all pre-paid impressions or other promotions not delivered as of the date of termination. Women.com agrees that if eDiets elects to extend the Agreement the monthly fee due and payable during the Make Good Period will be recalculated and reduced to reflect the changes in the revised delivery schedule.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the consequences of Women.com failing to meet the guaranteed advertising impressions. It states that if Women.com doesn't deliver at least 80% of the guaranteed impressions, they have 60 days to make up the shortfall. If they fail to do so, eDiets can either terminate the agreement immediately, with Women.com reimbursing for prepaid undelivered impressions, or authorize Women.com to deliver the shortfall within an extended period (the \"Make Good Period\"). However, the last sentence introduces a contradiction: it states that if eDiets extends the agreement, the monthly fee during the Make Good Period will be recalculated and reduced. This contradicts the initial premise that eDiets is entitled to a reimbursement for undelivered impressions upon termination. If the agreement is extended and fees are reduced, it's unclear whether eDiets also retains the right to full reimbursement for the initial shortfall should they later terminate.",

Following the Initial Term, Women.com shall have the right, upon no fewer than sixty (60) days prior written notice to eDiets, to increase the amount of the Payment Schedule provided, that (i) Women.com may not increase the Payment Schedule more than once in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months and (ii) such increase may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the then current Payment Schedule.",
        "explanation": "The initial clause specifies that payments begin 'on the tenth (10th) day after the execution of this Agreement and thereafter on the last day of each month.' This is inconsistent because it suggests the first payment is due on the 10th day, while subsequent payments are due on the last day of the month. This creates ambiguity regarding when the first payment is actually due.",

However, the agreement does not define what constitutes 'unreasonably withheld or delayed' consent. This ambiguity could lead to disputes if one party believes the other is being obstructive in the settlement process.",

        "section": "2.3 Notwithstanding 2.1 and 2.2, the Supplier may sell or supply the Products to end users within USA at anytime.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.1 grants the Distributor non-exclusive rights to distribute the products in the Territory. Section 2.2 allows the Supplier to remove inactive territories after the initial term. Section 2.3, however, allows the Supplier to sell directly to end users within the USA at any time, which is the entirety of the territory defined in Schedule 2. This effectively nullifies the distributor's non-exclusive rights within the USA, creating a contradiction.",

Section 20.2(d) states that if delivered by email, a notice is deemed to have been duly received on the date and at the time such email is received by the recipient whether such message is opened at that time. Section 20.3 directly contradicts this by stating that a notice given under this agreement shall not be validly given if sent by e-mail.",

        "explanation": "The agreement is between an Australian company and a US company. It's unclear why Ohio law would govern the agreement. The term 'jurisdiction will be determined on a case-by-case basis' is also ambigious and could lead to disputes over where a case should be heard.",

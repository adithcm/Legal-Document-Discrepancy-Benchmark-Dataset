RESELLER SHALL MAKE NO REPRESENTATION, GUARANTEE, OR WARRANTY CONCERNING THE COMPANY PRODUCT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED IN ADVANCE BY COMPANY IN WRITING. TO THE EXTENT THE RESELLER HAS COMPLIED WITH THE OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE COMPANY SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE RESELLER FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE RESELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES (WHETHER DIRECTLY OR IN CONNECTION WITH A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY) AS A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RESELLER SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES (WHETHER DIRECTLY OR IN CONNECTION WITH A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY) AS A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESELLERS ACTIVITIES.",
        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting indemnification clauses. The first part states the Company will indemnify the reseller. The second part states that the Reseller will indemnify the company. This creates ambiguity as to which party is responsible for which liabilities.",

Company shall indemnify, defend and hold Reseller and its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents, successors and assigns, harmless from and against any claim, demand lawsuit, cause of action or losses of any nature whatsoever, including reasonable attorneys fees, suffered or incurred by Reseller or any of them, arising out of, (i) any claim that the Company Products infringe any U.S. patent or copyright or that the Company Products incorporate any misappropriated trade secrets or (ii) any claim for injury or other loss to any person arising from the use of Company Products. Additionally, Reseller shall indemnify, defend and hold Company and its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents, successors and assigns, harmless from and against any claim, demand lawsuit, cause of action or losses of any nature whatsoever, including reasonable attorneys fees, suffered or incurred by Company or any of them, arising out of, (i) any claim that the Resellers Activities infringe any U.S. Business law or that the Resellers Activities violate any U.S. government process, procedure or requirement or (ii) any claim for injury or other loss to any person arising from the use of Resellers Activities.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'any U.S. Business law' is too broad and vague. It is not specific enough, as there is no defined body of law called 'U.S. Business Law.' This is ambigious and could lead to disputes over interpretation, as there are various federal and state laws that could be considered 'business laws'.",

        "explanation": "This section directly contradicts the indemnification clause in Section 8, where the Reseller agrees to indemnify the company for losses connected with the Resellers Activities. This flatly denies any liability of the reseller to the company for losses caused by the company products, creating an inconsistency. It is inconsistent with general legal principles that require parties to be responsible for their actions.",

Valeant shall use only Product Materials approved by Dova in the performance of Valeant Activities under this Agreement provided, however, that Valeant shall not be required to use any Product Materials that have not been approved by Valeant or which have not incorporated comments provided by Valeant and nothing herein shall require Valeant to use all Product Materials created or prepared by Dova and Valeant reserves the right not to use certain Product Materials.",
        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting statements regarding Valeant's obligation to use Product Materials. It initially states that Valeant shall use only Product Materials approved by Dova. However, it then says that Valeant is not required to use Product Materials that it hasn't approved or that haven't incorporated its comments, and that Valeant reserves the right not to use certain Product Materials. This creates ambiguity as to whether Valeant has a mandatory obligation to use Dova's Product Materials, or if it has the discretion to choose which materials to use.",

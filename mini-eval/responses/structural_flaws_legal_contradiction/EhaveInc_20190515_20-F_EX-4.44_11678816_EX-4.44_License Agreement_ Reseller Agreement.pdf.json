        "section": "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the exclusive appointment and license set out in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) shall become non-exclusive if: (ii) at any time after November 1, 2010 CHT fails to achieve annual revenues of $500,000.",
        "explanation": "The date 'November 1, 2010' is in the past, considering the agreement is dated October 30, 2018. This clause implies that the conversion to a non-exclusive agreement would have already occurred if CHT failed to achieve the specified revenue target by that date. This creates a temporal inconsistency, as the agreement is being entered into in 2018, but a condition is based on a past date. It is impossible to determine the exact intentions of this clause.",

        "section": "This term of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue in perpetuity (the Term), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained herein.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states that the term is in perpetuity unless terminated earlier. This is a contradiction as perpetuity means lasting forever, but the contract can be terminated, therefore, it is not in perpetuity.",

        "explanation": "The section mentions that 'CHT agrees to pay the Royalties and applicable taxes in accordance with the payment terms as set out in Schedule 6.' but the schedule is not attached to the document so it is impossible to know the payment terms. This is an omission in text.",

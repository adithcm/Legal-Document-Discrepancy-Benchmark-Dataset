        "explanation": "The definition of control is ambiguous because it includes ownership of 50% of income and capital or ownership of 50% of voting power, implying that these could be different. It's unclear if 'or' is meant to create separate conditions or if both must be met. The last condition says regardless of the percentage ownership interest held. This section contains contradiction in legal terms.",

        "explanation": "This section is inconsistent in the text. At first it says that any ammounts payable by the vendor to AT&T may be offset. Then it states that AT&T offset right shall not apply to any structured payments. This contradicts what was stated at the beggining of the section.",

        "explanation": "The text says that the excusable delay happens when ATT fails to deliver equipment 60 days prior, this does not make sense because it is impossible to fail 60 days prior. This is an example of structural flaw in text.",

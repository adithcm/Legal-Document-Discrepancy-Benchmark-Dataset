        "section": "8.7 The Repairer shall at its own expense procure and maintain in force, with insurers of internationally recognized reputation acceptable to the Company an Aviation Liability insurance which should include: (i) Aviation Products Liability insurance: the Repairer shall maintain or shall cause its Subcontractors to maintain a Products Liability Insurance during the performance of the Services up to an amount not less than [*****] per occurrence and in the annual aggregate and, (ii) Hangar Keeper Liability insurance: the Repairer shall maintain or shall cause its Subcontractors to maintain during the performance of the Services an Hangar Keeper Liability Insurance in an amount of not less than [*****] any one occurrence. The Repairer shall, at the latest upon the Signing Date, provide the Company with evidence of the insurance maintained in accordance with this Clause 8.7.",
        "explanation": "The wording 'The Repairer shall, at the latest upon the Signing Date, provide the Company with evidence of the insurance maintained in accordance with this Clause 8.7' suggests that the repairer should be providing the insurance at the latest on the signing date, but the wording in the previous sentances says 'The Repairer shall maintain or shall cause its Subcontractors to maintain during the performance of the Services', This suggests that the repairer and its subcontractors need to be maintaining the insurance during the services. This seems to contradict the need for the insruance on the signing date. ",

TAXES The prices set out in this Agreement [*****] and the [*****] shall not be required to pay and the [*****] shall bear, any present or future Taxes in any country of the Delivery [*****] pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement including the following: i) Taxes levied on goods imported into or services to be delivered under this Agreement and, ii) Taxes levied on materials, equipment, tools and documentation imported temporarily which are required for the performance of this Agreement and, iii) Taxes levied in Companys country for goods or services delivered by the Repairer to the Company and, iv) Value added taxes, sales tax, services tax, or any similar taxes imposed in any country, on goods or services delivered to the Company. In the event any of the Items above are levied upon the [*****], the [*****] shall promptly issue a Notice to the [*****]. The [*****], within [*****] of receipt of such notification from the [*****] shall either cause the charge to be waived or pay the charges directly. For those Items above that the [*****] is required by Law to pay, the [*****] shall charge the [*****] and the [*****] shall reimburse the [*****] in an amount which leaves the [*****] in the same economic situation as if such payment of charges and reimbursement thereof had not been required. If the Company is required by Law to make a withholding of taxes on the payments due to the Repairer under this Agreement, the Company shall gross up the payment so that the payment received by the Repairer after such withholding tax shall be the same amount of the prices described herein. For sake of clarity, the Repairer shall bear income tax assessed on the Repairers income and net profits in its country. For Items delivered by the Repairer to the Company, the final customs clearance on flow between any Repairers Affiliate located abroad and warehouse located in Brazil, as notably set forth in Clause 6, shall be borne by the Company. Customs duties, IPI, ISS, ICMS and other similar taxes shall be paid by the Company. In addition, the Company shall provide the Repairer with the  import declarations  pertaining to any import activities performed by the Company.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a lot of bracketed information making it hard to understand the intention of the parties. This makes the clause difficult to understand and creates ambiguity. There is also contradicting information. The first sentance says 'the (blank) shall not be required to pay' but then later the document goes on to say 'Customs duties, IPI, ISS, ICMS and other similar taxes shall be paid by the Company'. These sentances are contradicting.",

        "section": "23.7 Amendments: this Agreement shall only be varied or amended by a written document duly signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Exhibit 1 (List of ATR aircraft covered under this Agreement) and the Pool may be amended from time to time by the Repairer by way of Notice sent to the Company, unless, for LRUs reference suppression/replacement, the Company does not agree the same by way of Notice within [*****] as from the receipt date of the said Notice from the Repairer, in compliance with this Agreement and provided that it has no material economic impact to the Company.",
        "explanation": "This section is inconsistent. The first sentence states that the agreement can only be amended by a written document signed by both parties. However, the subsequent sentence allows Exhibit 1 and the Pool to be amended by the Repairer alone, provided the Company doesn't disagree within a certain timeframe and there's no material economic impact. This creates an inconsistency in the amendment process.",

        "section": "This Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (Renewal Term) provided WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term.",
        "explanation": "The condition for automatic renewal is based solely on payments received by WPT. It doesn't specify who needs to make these payments. This creates ambiguity because it is unclear if the 12 million USD needs to be payed by ZYNGA or it can be payed by someone else.",

        "section": "Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a potential contradiction. It states that Royalty payments can offset the Annual Minimum Guarantee, and vice versa. This could lead to a situation where neither party is obligated to pay if the amounts offset each other, which might not reflect the intended economic arrangement. The lack of clarity on how these offsets are calculated and applied over time introduces ambiguity.",

        "section": "WPT or its affiliates shall not authorize a Zynga Competitor to commercially exploit the Licensed Property in connection with social poker gaming via a license similar to the license granted herein for the Term. A Zynga Competitor means: 1) Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd. Or Big Fish Games, Inc. 2) HUUUGE Inc. 3) Activision Blizzard, Inc., King.com Ltd. Or King.com (US) LLC 4) Scientific Games Corporation 5) Tencent Holdings Limited and 6) Murka Ltd. The parties agree to work together in good faith to amend the definition of a Zynga Competitor if that meaning for Zynga reasonably changes during the Term.",
        "explanation": "The definition of a Zynga Competitor is ambiguous and potentially problematic. Listing specific companies might not accurately reflect the competitive landscape throughout the entire term of the agreement. The clause stating that the parties will work together to amend the definition introduces uncertainty as it relies on future agreement, which is not guaranteed.",

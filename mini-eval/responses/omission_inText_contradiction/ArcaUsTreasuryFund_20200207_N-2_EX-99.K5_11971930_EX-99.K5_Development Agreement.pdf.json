        "section": "WHEREAS, the Blockchain Administrator will also serve as the Fund's investment adviser (the \"Adviser\") pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement entered into by and between the Fund and the Adviser (as amended from time to time, the \"Advisory Agreement\") and WHEREAS, the Fund bears all costs and expenses incurred in its operation, administration and transactions which are not specifically assumed by the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement or this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The 'WHEREAS' clauses introduce the Blockchain Administrator as also serving as the Fund's investment advisor, implying a dual role. However, Section 1(e) later states that the Blockchain Administrator, in its capacity as such under *this* agreement, will not provide investment advice. This creates a contradiction: is the Blockchain Administrator providing investment advice or not?",

        "explanation": "This statement implies that the Blockchain Administrator's contracted service providers might *not* maintain books and records of the Fund. The phrase 'if any' suggests a conditional aspect to record maintenance which is concerning from a regulatory compliance perspective. It should be an absolute requirement, especially considering the records must align with Section 2 of the agreement.",

        "section": "1.6 Alternate Product shall mean a pharmaceutical product that is commercialized by Valeant or its Affiliates in the Territory and that is part of the Salix business segment of Valeants parent company, Bausch Health Companies, Inc. (or, in the event that such business segments are restructured, that is part of the Salix business unit), and which product is complementary to the Product with regard to Target Professionals in the Specialty.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Alternate Product' relies on the structure of Valeant's parent company, Bausch Health Companies, Inc., and its 'Salix business segment'. If that structure changes through a restructuring, the definition switches to 'Salix business unit'. This introduces ambiguity because it's unclear what criteria determine a 'business unit' versus a 'business segment,' potentially leading to disputes over which products qualify as 'Alternate Products' after a restructuring.",

(a) [***], neither Valeant nor its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, [***] in the Territory other than the Product provided that if the Agreement is terminated by Dova pursuant to [***], then any Tail Period shall be immediately terminated if either Valeant or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, [***] in the Territory other than the Product during such Tail Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 2.3.1(a) shall not apply to any products marketed, promoted, detailed, offered for sale, or sold by any business (or any portion thereof), other Person, or group of Persons, [***].",
        "explanation": "The non-competition clause, Section 2.3.1(a), has multiple redactions '[***]' which makes it impossible to fully understand the scope and limitations of the non-compete agreement. It's unclear what actions are prohibited and what exceptions apply. This is a significant omission because the enforceability and interpretation of this clause are severely compromised without knowing the redacted content.",

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, as soon as practicable following the Effective Date (but in no event later than [***]), Dova and Valeant (under the guidance of their respective pharmacovigilance departments, or equivalent thereof) shall identify and finalize the responsibilities the Parties shall employ to protect patients and promote their well- being in a separate safety data exchange agreement (Pharmacovigilance Agreement).",
        "explanation": "While Section 5.4 mandates the creation of a separate 'Pharmacovigilance Agreement,' the details of those responsibilities are not specified in this Co-Promotion Agreement. It states Dova is responsible for pharmacovigilance, signal detection, etc. This creates a structural flaw because essential obligations are left to a future agreement, making it hard to understand the parties' immediate responsibilities and recourse if that separate agreement is not adequately created or executed.",

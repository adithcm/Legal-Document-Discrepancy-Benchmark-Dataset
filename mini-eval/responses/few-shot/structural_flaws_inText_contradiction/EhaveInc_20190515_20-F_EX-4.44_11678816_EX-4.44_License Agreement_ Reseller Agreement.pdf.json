        "section": "For so long as the appointment set out in Section 2(a) is exclusive, CHT shall not enter into an agreement (a Competitive Transaction) with any other Person related to the license, sub-license, sale, resale or provide service, solutions, goods or products, that are substantially similar to or competitive with the Ehave Companion Solution.",
        "explanation": "The term 'substantially similar' is ambiguous and subjective. It lacks clear criteria, potentially leading to disputes over what constitutes a competitive product or service. This vagueness can restrict CHT's business activities without clear boundaries.",

        "section": "In the event that CHT delays in providing such decisions, input or performance of its obligations, the development and implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution shall be correspondingly delayed. Subject to the foregoing, Ehave acknowledges that time is of the essence with respect to its obligations hereunder and that prompt and timely performance of all such obligations, including all development and implementation dates, timetables, project milestones and other requirements in this Agreement is strictly required.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency within this section. The first sentence suggests CHT's delays will excuse Ehave's performance, while the subsequent sentences emphasize that 'time is of the essence' for Ehave. This creates uncertainty about whether Ehave's deadlines are truly strict if CHT's delays are a factor.",

        "section": "If the Acceptance Procedures were conducted three (3) times in respect of the initial implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution, and the eHAve Companion Solution failed to pass the Acceptance Criteria on the third (3rd) try, then, at the discretion of either Party, Ehave may continue to fix the problem, or terminate this Agreement in which case, CHT shall promptly return to Ehave all copies of the Ehave Companion Solution, including the Specifications and any other items delivered to CHT by Ehave thereunder and Ehave shall promptly refund to CHT any monies paid by CHT in respect of the initial development and implementation of the Ehave Companion Solution.",
        "explanation": "The option for 'either Party' to decide on the next steps after three failed acceptance attempts introduces an imbalance. It implies Ehave can force CHT to continue even if CHT wants to terminate after multiple failures, which contradicts the purpose of having acceptance criteria.",

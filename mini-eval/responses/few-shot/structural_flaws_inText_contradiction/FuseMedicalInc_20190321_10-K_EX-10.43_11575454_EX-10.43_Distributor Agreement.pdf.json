        "explanation": "The term 'Inactive Territories' is defined in clause 1.1 as a country where the Distributor has not sold or supplied the Product during the Initial Term. Schedule 2 defines the Territory as 'USA'. Since the Territory is defined as only the USA and Inactive Territories is defined as country, it is impossible to have inactive territories as the territory is only one country, creating a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The figures provided for annual impressions (45,000,000, 13,000,000, 12,000,000) do not match the quarterly impressions multiplied by four (11,250,000 * 4 = 45,000,000, 3,250,000 * 4 = 13,000,000, 3,000,000 * 4 = 12,000,000). Although the annual impression is mathematically correct, it is very unusual for the annual guarantees to be exactly four times the quaterly guarantees, which is suspect of the numbers being correct or accurate.",

There is no provision for when the parties can start the renewal discussion, and it is unreasonably restrictive to only provide for a 30 day period.

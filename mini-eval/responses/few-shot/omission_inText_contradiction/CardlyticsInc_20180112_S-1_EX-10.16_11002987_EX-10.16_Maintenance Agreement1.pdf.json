Upon delivery, Bank of America will have all license right outlined in Section 2.7.1:",
        "explanation": "This section has an inconsistency. It says Bank of America will have all license rights outlined in Section 2.7.1 upon delivery, but Section 2.7.1 includes rights to patents and copyrights 'hereafter acquired by Supplier.'

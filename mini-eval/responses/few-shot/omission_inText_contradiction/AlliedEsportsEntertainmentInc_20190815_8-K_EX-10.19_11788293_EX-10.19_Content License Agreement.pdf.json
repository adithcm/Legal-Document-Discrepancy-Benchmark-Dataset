        "section": "This Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (Renewal Term) provided WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term.",
        "explanation": "This clause has ambiguity in text. It is unclear whether the payments of 12 million must be royalties or if the payments can be from any source of funds. Since the earlier terms in the document specified that the annual minimum guarantee comes from royalties it can be assumed the funds should come from royalties, but that is not specified in the document.",

        "explanation": "This section has structural flaws in text. The text makes references to sections of the agreement, but it is not structured properly. There are parenthesis in the middle of sentences and it makes it hard to read and hard to interpret. The term 'Net Revenue(s)' is also awkwardly defined.",

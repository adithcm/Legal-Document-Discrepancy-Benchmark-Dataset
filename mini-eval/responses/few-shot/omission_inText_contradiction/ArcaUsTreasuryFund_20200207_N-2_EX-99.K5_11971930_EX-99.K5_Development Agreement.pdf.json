        "section": "WHEREAS, the Blockchain Administrator will also serve as the Fund's investment adviser (the \"Adviser\") pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement entered into by and between the Fund and the Adviser (as amended from time to time, the \"Advisory Agreement\") and WHEREAS, the Fund bears all costs and expenses incurred in its operation, administration and transactions which are not specifically assumed by the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement or this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section implies that the Blockchain Administrator is also the Investment Adviser, yet also refers to costs not assumed by the Adviser 'pursuant to the Advisory Agreement or this Agreement.' If the Blockchain Administrator and Adviser are the same entity, this creates ambiguity. The section suggests they are distinct, but the sentence prior indicates they are the same, creating confusion on which entity assumes which responsibility.",

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 5 to the contrary, nothing contained herein shall protect or be deemed to protect the Indemnified Parties against or entitle or be deemed to entitle the Indemnified Parties to indemnification in respect of, any liability to the Fund or its security holders to which the Indemnified Parties would otherwise be subject by reason of criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of the Blockchain Administrator's duties and obligations under this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section provides broad indemnification to the Blockchain Administrator, but also attempts to carve out exceptions for criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard. The language is convoluted and the extent of the carve-outs is unclear. The interplay between the initial broad indemnification and the exceptions creates ambiguity about the situations in which the Blockchain Administrator is truly not indemnified.",

In such case, to the extent the applicable laws of the State of New York, or any of the provisions herein, conflict with the provisions of the Investment Fund Act, the latter shall control.",
        "explanation": "The clause states that the agreement is governed by New York law but also by the Investment Company Act, and that the latter controls in cases of conflict. This creates structural flaws because the Investment Company Act is federal law, not state law. This results in a structural flaw that could confuse readers about the primary governing law.",

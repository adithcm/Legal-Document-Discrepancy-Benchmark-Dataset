        "section": "1.2 Term of Agreement. The Term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in full force and effect until the expiration or earlier termination of the last Addendum to expire or be terminated, at which time this Agreement will expire, unless this Agreement is sooner terminated in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous because it mentions the term continuing until the last addendum expires or is terminated, but also states the agreement can be 'sooner terminated' according to its own terms. This creates uncertainty about how termination affects addendums and vice versa.",

Physical Entry means that an individual (a) is permitted to bodily enter, on an unsupervised (or badged) basis, into secured areas not available to the general public, or (b) is permitted on a regular basis to have supervised or escorted bodily access into secured areas not available to the general public for more than thirty (30) days in the aggregate annually.",
        "explanation": "This definition of 'Physical Entry' could be interpreted differently depending on the context. The use of 'or' between (a) and (b) suggests that either unsupervised access or supervised access exceeding 30 days qualifies as Physical Entry. However, 'regular basis' lacks a precise meaning and whether occasional supervised access adding up to more than 30 days is counted is not clear.",

(a) Neither Party may assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement, voluntarily or involuntarily, without the prior written consent of the other Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be signed by an authorized representative of the Party giving such consent) provided, however, that without the consent of Vendor, AT&T may assign its rights, or delegate its duties, or both, in whole or in part, to any present or future Affiliate of AT&T so long as AT&T Mobility LLC shall remain liable for such Affiliates failure to satisfy its obligations hereunder.",
        "explanation": "There's an inconsistency regarding assignment. The first sentence states that neither party can assign without consent, but the 'provided however' clause allows AT&T to assign to an affiliate without Vendor's consent, which appears to contradict the initial statement. While AT&T Mobility LLC remains liable, the initial restriction is still undermined.",

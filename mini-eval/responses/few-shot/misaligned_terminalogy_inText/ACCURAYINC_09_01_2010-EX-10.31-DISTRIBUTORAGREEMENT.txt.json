        "explanation": "The agreement states the distributor is appointed as a 'non-exclusive, worldwide distributor.' However, the phrase 'solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases' significantly restricts the distributor's rights, which contradicts the 'worldwide distributor' aspect. This creates an ambiguity regarding the scope of the distribution rights.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses who pays for expedited shipping costs. However, it only addresses situations where the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order. This omission about who bears the cost if the requested date is less than six months is a flaw.",

A wire transfer made in advance of the date payment is due, made in U.S. dollars, to a bank selected by Accuray, according to the following schedule:\n5.4.1.2.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and\n5.4.1.2.2. The remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.",
        "explanation": "The term 'reasonably undisputed invoice' is not defined. What constitutes a 'reasonable dispute' is subjective and open to interpretation, creating ambiguity in the payment terms and potentially leading to disagreements over payment deadlines.",

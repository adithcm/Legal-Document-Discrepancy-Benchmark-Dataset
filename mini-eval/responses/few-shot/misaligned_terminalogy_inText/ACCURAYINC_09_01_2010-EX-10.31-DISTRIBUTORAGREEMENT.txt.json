        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens. For the purposes of clarity within this document, a Partner is classified as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "This definition is misaligned. Initially, the distributor is explicitly defined as Siemens. However, the subsequent sentences broaden the definition of 'Partner' to include Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party with distribution rights granted by Siemens. This misalignment introduces ambiguity, as it's unclear whether all provisions applicable to the 'Distributor' also apply to these additional 'Partners' and under what conditions.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "There's ambiguity regarding expedited shipping costs. The text mentions Accuray bearing supplementary costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the feasibility clause gives Accuray leeway, potentially leading to disputes about who covers expedited costs if Accuray deems the Distributor's preferred carrier unfeasible.",

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts of International Sale of Goods (CISG) and the provisions of German private international law.",
        "explanation": "This governing law clause excludes both CISG and 'the provisions of German private international law.' The exclusion of German private international law creates ambiguity. It's unclear how disputes involving parties from different countries will be resolved, especially if there are conflicts of law issues that would normally be addressed by such principles. This omission could lead to uncertainty in enforcement, as the text removes the standard method of addressing conflict of law issues.",

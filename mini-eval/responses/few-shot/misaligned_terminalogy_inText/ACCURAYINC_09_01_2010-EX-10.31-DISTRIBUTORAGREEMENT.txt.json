        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "The recitals state the distributor is appointed for a worldwide distribution, which could be read as including all countries, but then the definition in section 4.4 limits the scope. If Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of Systems specifically for the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor to enter into a distribution agreement. This creates an ambiguity as to the scope of the 'worldwide' distributorship because it is not truly 'worldwide'.",

        "explanation": "This clause dictates that the Quote terms prevail over the Purchase Order, but the next sentence states that the agreement prevails over both the quote and purchase order. This creates confusion, because it's unclear which document takes precedence in specific scenarios.",

        "explanation": "The statement implies that Accuray must make spare parts available, but that the terms must be \u2018commercially reasonable\u2019. This has ambiguity because \u2018commercially reasonable\u2019 can be interpreted differently by each party and there is not clarity here.",

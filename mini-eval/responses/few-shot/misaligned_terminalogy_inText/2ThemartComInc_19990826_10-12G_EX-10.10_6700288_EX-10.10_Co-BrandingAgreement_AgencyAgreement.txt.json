        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. Once approved, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently implement their respective obligations under the SOW.",
        "explanation": "The clause states that either party can terminate if an SOW isn't agreed upon within 2 months. However, it also states that once approved, the parties must use 'commercially reasonable efforts' to implement it. This creates an ambiguity: If one party is not diligently implementing the SOW after approval (but still using commercially reasonable efforts), it's not clear whether the other party can terminate based on the initial failure to agree within 2 months, or if they are now bound by the approved SOW.",

        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines how advertising fees are calculated but it is unclear if the 'Customer Engagements' are the same as 'Transaction Inquiries' or if they are the same as 'Transactions', as defined in Section 1. This misalignment could lead to disputes over how fees are calculated.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor' is structurally flawed and doesn't make logical sense. It suggests a condition where the Protected Party (the one being indemnified) must also be considered a key agent of the Guarantor (the one providing indemnification). This condition undermines the basic premise of indemnification, which is to protect a party from the actions of another, regardless of an agency relationship.",

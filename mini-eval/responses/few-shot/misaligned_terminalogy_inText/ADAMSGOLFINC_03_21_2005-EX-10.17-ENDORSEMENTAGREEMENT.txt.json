        "explanation": "The term of the contract is not clearly defined because the exact number of years and months and the terminating date are redacted. This lack of clarity makes it impossible to determine the duration of the agreement and creates ambiguity around the parties' obligations over time.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "This section discusses the minimum number of tournaments CONSULTANT must play and the repayment schedule if this minimum is not met, but the specific numbers are redacted. This omission is significant because it prevents a clear understanding of CONSULTANT's obligations and the financial consequences of failing to meet those obligations. Furthermore, what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play' is also not clearly defined, which could lead to disputes over whether the minimum tournament requirement has been met. The absence of specific numbers creates uncertainty about a key contractual term.",

        "explanation": "While this clause specifies how to deliver written notice to ADAMS GOLF, it does not include any explicit method of confirming that the notice was received. While delivery via postpaid envelope is stipulated, there is no requirement for certified mail, return receipt requested, or any similar mechanism to ensure proof of receipt. This omission creates a potential risk, as ADAMS GOLF could argue that a notice was never received if a dispute arises.",

        "section": "TERM OF CONTRACT The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The text lacks clarity regarding the exact contract termination date, specifying only the commencement date. The absence of a specific termination date creates ambiguity about the contract's duration, making it difficult to ascertain the precise period during which the agreement is in effect.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause and Section 23 create an inconsistency regarding repayment obligations upon termination. Section 22 mandates repayment from the Consultant's estate if he dies or cannot play golf, while Section 23 mandates repayment if either party commits a material breach. These sections create conflicting obligations concerning whether repayment is required upon termination, potentially leading to disputes over the appropriate course of action.",

        "explanation": "This section creates an oversight because it omits a critical legal standard, which is the concept of 'materiality'. Without it, any prior obligation of Watson's, no matter how small, could be argued as a breach of this warranty. It's crucial to include a materiality qualifier here to protect Watson from trivial prior obligations that don't meaningfully impact the agreement.",

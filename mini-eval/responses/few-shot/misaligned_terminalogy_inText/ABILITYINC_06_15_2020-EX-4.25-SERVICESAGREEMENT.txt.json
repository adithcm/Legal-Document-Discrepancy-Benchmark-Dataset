        "section": "This Services Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is entered into on October 1, 2019 and is made effective as of November 1, 2019 (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between [ * * * ] (the \"Provider\"), and TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD., a company organized and existing under the laws of Singapore and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel (each and both of them \"Recipient\").",
        "explanation": "The agreement lists two companies, TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, as the 'Recipient.' However, it later refers to 'Recipient' in the singular. This creates an ambiguity as to whether obligations and rights apply jointly or severally to these two entities, especially if their interests diverge. The lack of clarity on how 'Recipient' is defined regarding its responsibilities and entitlements introduces potential for disputes and confusion.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement...\" is structurally flawed and nonsensical. The repetition of the word agreement doesn't make sense and makes the text confusing.",

        "explanation": "Section 3.1 states that the agreement terminates on December 31, 2020. However, Section 2.2(c) states that Provider shall allow the Recipient to use [ * * * ] at no cost until December 31, 2021. This creates an inconsistency with the termination date of the contract, as the recipient is allowed to use something until a date after the contract ends. This suggests that a service would continue to be provided even after the agreement has terminated.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous. Does 'complete at least one transaction per month' mean they must complete a transaction *every* month to be considered a customer, or only in one month? This lack of clarity affects how advertising fees are calculated under Section 5.1, which is based on transactions from 'Customers'.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 allows termination if an SOW is not agreed upon within 2 months. However, Section 2.3 states that either party can terminate if the Launch Date does not occur within 4 months. The SOW is crucial for defining the Information Transfer Mechanism, which must be working before the launch. It's unclear if the ability to terminate after 2 months (no SOW) is separate from the 4-month launch deadline, which may depend on the SOW. If no SOW is agreed upon, there may not be a launch date",

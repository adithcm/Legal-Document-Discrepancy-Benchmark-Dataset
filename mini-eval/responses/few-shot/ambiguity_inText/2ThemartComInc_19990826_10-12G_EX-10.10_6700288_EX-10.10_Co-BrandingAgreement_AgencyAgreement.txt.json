        "section": "\"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous and potentially contradictory. It defines customers as users who complete at least one transaction *per month*. However, the term 'Customers' is used in Section 5.1 to calculate advertising fees based on 'average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter.' This creates ambiguity. Does it only include users who completed transactions *every month* of the quarter, or those who completed *at least one transaction during the entire quarter*? This can drastically change the calculation of advertising fees and creates an in-text contradiction.",

A party shall not unreasonably withhold or delay the granting of its approval of such materials, and such approval shall be provided to the other party within one (1) business day of receipt",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the timing requirement for approval. The first sentence states that the request for approval should be submitted no less than three business days before the release date. The second sentence states that approval should be provided within one business day of receipt. This implies that a party has only one business day to respond to a request that must be submitted at least three business days in advance. This creates a situation where there is a 2 day gap where the approval party isn't obligated to do anything.",

        "explanation": "The structure of these indemnification clauses creates confusion. While each party agrees to indemnify the other for liabilities arising from their respective content, it's unclear how these obligations interact with the overall liability framework, especially Section 10's limitation on liability for special, incidental, or consequential damages and lost profits. There is no connection made between Section 9 and 10. Section 9 discusses claims losses, costs, and expenses while Section 10 discusses damages or lost profits.",

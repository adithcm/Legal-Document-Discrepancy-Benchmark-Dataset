        "explanation": "The contract states it is 'entered into' on October 1, 2019, but the 'Effective Date' is November 1, 2019. This discrepancy creates ambiguity as to when the obligations and rights under the agreement actually commence. It's unclear whether actions taken between October 1 and November 1 are covered by this agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity because it states that Recipient owns all rights to inventions made by the Provider if both parties agree it is related to the services. This is a conditional assignment. It's unclear what happens if the parties disagree on whether the invention relates to the services or if one party refuses to agree. The conditionality weakens the assignment and creates uncertainty.",

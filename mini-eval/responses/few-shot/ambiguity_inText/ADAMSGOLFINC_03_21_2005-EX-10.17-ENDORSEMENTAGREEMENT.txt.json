        "explanation": "The contract term is ambiguous because the number of years and months, and the termination date are redacted. This lack of clarity makes it impossible to determine the actual duration of the agreement, which introduces uncertainty and potential disputes about when the contract expires. This creates an in-text contradiction because the start date is given but the end date is not specified, rendering the 'term' undefined.",

        "section": "MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION\nA. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "The repayment clause is based on a 'satisfactory record of play,' and the minimum number of tournaments and the amounts to be repaid are redacted. This creates ambiguity regarding the performance standards and the financial consequences for not meeting them. Without specific criteria for 'satisfactory record of play,' ADAMS GOLF could potentially demand repayment even if Watson participates in a significant number of tournaments, leading to possible disputes. The redacted repayment amounts also introduce uncertainty regarding the potential financial impact.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This indemnification clause initially excludes attorney's fees, then contradicts itself by stating that ADAMS GOLF will cover the CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000. This creates ambiguity because it is not clear under which conditions ADAMS GOLF would be responsible for the attorney's fees, making it difficult to enforce the clause. This contradiction could lead to disputes about who bears the cost of legal defense in case of a claim.",

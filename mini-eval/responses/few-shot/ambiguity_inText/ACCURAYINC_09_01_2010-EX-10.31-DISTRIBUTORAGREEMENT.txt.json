        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "The text defines the scope of the distributorship as 'non-exclusive, worldwide distributor...in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases.' This implies that the distributor is limited to sales involving multiple LINAC or multi-modality purchases only. However, the contract later references sales of 'Products' generally, without always specifying the multiple purchase requirement. This creates an ambiguity as to whether the distributor can also sell individual systems or products.",

        "section": "Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "This sentence states that Accuray's failure to respond to a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes a disapproval. However, disapproval is not clearly defined. Does this mean the purchase order is automatically rejected, or does it mean that Accuray can, at a later time, decide to approve it or simply that the distributor needs to resubmit the purchase order. This ambiguity can lead to disputes over order validity and timing.",

        "explanation": "This warranty clause contains an internal contradiction. The warranty period is defined as 'one (1) year following Installation...but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment.' This means that if installation occurs more than six months after shipment, the customer gets less than a one-year warranty from installation. This contradiction regarding the length of the warranty is a discrepancy.",

        "explanation": "The agreement's initial term extends to the end of the calendar year, creating ambiguity regarding agreements executed late in the year. If executed in December, the initial term is very short, affecting the minimum quotas in Schedule A.",

MA will notify Company immediately in the event that it is unable to respond effectively to any end users requests.",
        "explanation": "The text does not clearly define what 'as defined' means, making it difficult to determine the exact support responsibilities of MA. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes over the level and scope of support MA must provide.",

        "explanation": "The requirement to pay the service fee 'for each month that MA has no sales' contradicts the quarterly payment schedule. It's unclear if the fee applies to partial months or only full months with no sales, causing confusion.",

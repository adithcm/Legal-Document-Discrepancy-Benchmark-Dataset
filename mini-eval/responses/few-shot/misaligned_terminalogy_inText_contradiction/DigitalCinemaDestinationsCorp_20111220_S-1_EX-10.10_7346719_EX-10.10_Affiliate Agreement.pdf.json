        "explanation": "This definition is vague. It does not specify the parties involved in the Beverage Agreement other than Pepsi, nor does it outline the subject matter covered. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the scope and interpretation of the Beverage Agreement, especially in relation to exclusivity clauses or competitive product restrictions.",

        "explanation": "The term 'promptly' is ambiguous. It does not define a specific timeframe for the installation of the non-digital slide projector, making the obligation unclear and potentially unenforceable. The contract should provide a fixed deadline or a specific number of days/weeks from the Effective Date.",

        "explanation": "This section lacks clarity regarding how the 'value of the NCM Equipment' is determined. It mentions the remaining value on NCM's financial statements but does not detail the depreciation method or provide a mechanism for independent valuation. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the amount payable by Network Affiliate.",

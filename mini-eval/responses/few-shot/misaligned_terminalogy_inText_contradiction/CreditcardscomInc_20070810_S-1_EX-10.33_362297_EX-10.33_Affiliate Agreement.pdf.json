Chase reserves, in its sole discretion, with or without reason, the right to accept or reject your registration into the Chase Affiliate Program, including but not limited to a determination that your site is unsuitable for or incompatible with the Affiliate Program based on the following criteria (collectively Restricted Content)",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'with or without reason' grants Chase the right to reject applications arbitrarily, undermining the purpose of the listed criteria for rejection. This lack of constraint creates ambiguity as to what standards applicants must meet and allows for potentially discriminatory or unfair decisions.",

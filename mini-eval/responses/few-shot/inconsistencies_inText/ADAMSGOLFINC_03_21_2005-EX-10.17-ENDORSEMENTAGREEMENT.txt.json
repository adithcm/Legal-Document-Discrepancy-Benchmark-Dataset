        "section": "TERM OF CONTRACT The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The exact duration of the contract is ambiguous because the years, months and day of the termination date are redacted. This introduces ambiguity in calculating when the agreement ends and what the obligations are during each specific period, because one cannot determine the correct time that the contract is over. This creates an in-text contradiction since the start date is defined, but the end date is missing.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency. It states that if the consultant is unable to play tour golf due to any reason other than an injury during an Adams Golf promotional event, Adams Golf can terminate the agreement, and the consultant must repay Adams Golf for the unperformed period. However, it also mentions that if the consultant dies, the same conditions apply. Applying repayment obligations to the consultant's estate in the event of death could be problematic. Contractual obligations post-death are complex, and this clause lacks specific details on how the estate will handle the professional obligations that the consultant can no longer fulfill. This might lead to legal disputes about the enforceability and fairness of these repayment terms against the estate.",

        "explanation": "While specifying Kansas law is acceptable, the absence of a venue selection clause after the arbitration clause could cause conflicts. While the arbitration clause does mention Venue shall be Kansas, it is unclear whether a normal lawsuit, outside of the arbitration clause, could occur outside of Kansas, or if venue can be properly transfered outside of Kansas.",

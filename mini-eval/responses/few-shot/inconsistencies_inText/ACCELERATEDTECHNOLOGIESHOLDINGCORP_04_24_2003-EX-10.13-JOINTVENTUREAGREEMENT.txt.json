        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines that neither venturer receives compensation for JV services, only reimbursement for direct expenses. However, Section 9 later states, 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.' This guaranteed payment to PVSS directly contradicts the earlier statement prohibiting compensation for services, creating an internal inconsistency.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the process of asset distribution upon termination and specifies that if there's a dispute about the valuation of assets, CCGI has the final say. This is not an equal division of power in the event of dissolution. This is a structural flaw because it creates an imbalance and allows one party more power.",

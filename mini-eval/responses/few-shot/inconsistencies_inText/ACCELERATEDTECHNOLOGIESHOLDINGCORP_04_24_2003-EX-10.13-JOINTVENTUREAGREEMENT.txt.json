        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction regarding distributions. The first part states that distributions can only be made if the Joint Venture's assets exceed its liabilities and proportionally to each venturer's interest. However, the subsequent clause guarantees PVSS a payment of $10,000 per month 'regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.' This contradicts the preceding condition, as PVSS is entitled to payment even if the Joint Venture is not profitable and lacks the assets to cover its liabilities, which violates the pro rata distribution rule.",

        "section": "Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "The contradiction lies in the asset valuation during liquidation. The clause initially mandates that if an asset can't be divided, the parties must agree on a price to ensure proportional distribution. However, it then grants Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. (CCGI) the 'final say' on the asset's value in case of a dispute. This contradicts the need for mutual agreement, as CCGI can unilaterally determine the value, potentially leading to an imbalanced distribution that advantages CCGI and disadvantages Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. (PVSS).",

('PVSS'), (the 'Parties' or 'Joint Venturers' if referred to collectively, or the 'Party' or Joint Venturer' if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the 'Joint Venture'), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The introduction specifies that the parties are forming a joint venture but explicitly states they are 'not as partners.' This presents a structural flaw. The term 'joint venture' often implies a partnership-like relationship with shared control and liability, and the explicit denial of a partnership raises uncertainty and potential legal issues. The document doesn't adequately clarify the legal distinction they are attempting to establish, which can lead to interpretive disputes, especially since many aspects of the agreement resemble a partnership arrangement.",

        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The clause allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fee rate without i-Escrow's consent is concerning. It gives 2TheMart unchecked power to change a fundamental financial term of the agreement, potentially making the agreement economically unfeasible for i-Escrow. This creates a significant imbalance of power and could be deemed unconscionable, depending on the jurisdiction and the extent of the adjustment. The language 'to reflect present market conditions' is also vague and does not provide sufficient constraint on 2TheMart's ability to adjust the rate. There's no mechanism for i-Escrow to dispute the adjustment or terminate the agreement if the rate becomes unacceptable. If i-Escrow does not agree with the rate, they are still bound to the contract which gives no option to negotiate or terminate the contract.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement automatically renews for another year. This contradicts the earlier statement that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement of the parties.' The automatic renewal clause undermines the requirement for mutual consent, potentially binding a party to an extension they didn't actively agree to.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' creates significant ambiguity and could severely limit the scope of indemnification. It's unclear what legal standard will be used to determine when the Indemnified Party is 'deemed a principal.' This condition creates uncertainty about the actual extent of indemnification coverage and could lead to disputes over whether a particular claim falls within the scope of the indemnity. This is because the meaning is not clear and can be interpreted differently by each party.",

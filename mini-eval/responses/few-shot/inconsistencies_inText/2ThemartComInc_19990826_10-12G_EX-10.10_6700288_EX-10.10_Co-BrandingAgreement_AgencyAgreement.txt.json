        "section": "The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees without i-Escrow's consent creates a significant imbalance of power. While the adjustment is supposedly tied to 'present market conditions,' the lack of a defined mechanism or objective standard for determining these conditions leaves room for arbitrary adjustments. This could lead to disputes and undermines the fairness and predictability expected in a contract. The unilateral power to revise fees may be deemed unenforceable under general contract law principles that require mutual assent.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It first states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement' but then adds that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement 'shall be automatically renewed.' This creates confusion. The 'automatic renewal' clause contradicts the earlier requirement for 'mutual written agreement.'",

        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the fundamental purpose of certain sections, particularly the indemnity (Section 9), limitation on liability (Section 10), and confidentiality (Section 11) clauses. Indemnity, limitation of liability, and confidentiality provisions are designed to protect the parties even after the agreement ends, especially concerning actions taken during the agreement's term. Stating these sections don't survive termination defeats their very purpose. For instance, if a claim arises after termination but is based on actions during the agreement, the indemnity clause would be rendered useless. This contradicts industry standards. and causes legal issues.",

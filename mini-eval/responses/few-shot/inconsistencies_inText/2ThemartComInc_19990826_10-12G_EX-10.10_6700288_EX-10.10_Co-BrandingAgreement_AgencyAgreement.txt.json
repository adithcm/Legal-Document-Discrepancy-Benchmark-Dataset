        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section allows 2TheMart to unilaterally revise the advertising fee formula without i-Escrow's consent. This creates a significant power imbalance and uncertainty for i-Escrow, as the financial terms can be altered at any time. This could be deemed unconscionable, depending on the extent of the revisions and the prevailing market conditions. It also has an ambiguity in text because the term Adjusted Rate is mentioned before any definition of it.",

        "section": "12.4 FORCE MAJEURE. Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory. While it excuses performance due to force majeure events, it also states that the occurrence of such an event does not limit obligations under Section 9, which concerns indemnification. This means that even if a party's failure to perform leads to a third-party claim due to a force majeure event, the party remains liable for indemnification. This undermines the purpose of the force majeure clause.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the term and renewal process. The language is structurally flawed because it first states that renewal requires mutual written agreement, but then states that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement automatically renews. This is a clear structural flaw that can cause confusion over how the agreement is to be renewed.",

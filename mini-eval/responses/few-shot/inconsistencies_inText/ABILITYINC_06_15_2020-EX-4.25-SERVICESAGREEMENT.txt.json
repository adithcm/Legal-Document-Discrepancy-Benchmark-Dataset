For example, if services were performed between October 1 and November 1, it is unclear if those services are covered under this agreement.",

        "explanation": "This clause has been redacted, making it difficult to assess the obligation properly. It is unclear what 'use' entails or what implications arise from this free usage ceasing after December 31, 2021.

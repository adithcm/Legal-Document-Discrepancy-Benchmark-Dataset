        "section": "This Services Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is entered into on October 1, 2019 and is made effective as of November 1, 2019 (the \"Effective Date\")",
        "explanation": "This sets up a period of time between the 'entered into' date and the 'effective date.' However, Section 3.1 states that 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date' and 'shall terminate on December 31, 2020.' This creates a contradiction because the agreement states it begins on the effective date, which is November 1, 2019 and it terminates on December 31, 2020, making the agreement only good for a little over a year, even though the term 'Services' implies it is longer than that.",

In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "The text outlines that the Recipient will pay the Provider the 'actual cost' plus 10% as well as reimburse the Provider for all 'Out-of-Pocket Costs'. However, it does not define what 'actual cost' means, like labor, materials, etc.. This is an amiguity in the text.",

        "explanation": "This clause is contradictory because it first states disputes will be resolved in Israel. Then it introduces an exception allowing the Recipient to pursue injunctions against the Provider in the Provider's country. This undermines the original agreement and causes ambiguity.",

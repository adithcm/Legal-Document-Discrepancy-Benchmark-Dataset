        "section": "Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The term 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases' is used throughout the contract but lacks clarity in its practical application. While definitions are provided in Sections 1.5 and 1.6, it's unclear how strictly this limitation is enforced. For instance, if a customer initially intends a 'Multiple LINAC Purchase' but later alters the order, the contract doesn't specify if the distributor is still entitled to compensation or if the agreement still applies.",

        "section": "Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This is an inconsistency in text. The section addresses supplementary shipping costs, stating Accuray will bear the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the order submission. However, Section 2.4 states Accuray's standard lead time for delivery is six months. These sections contradict because if the standard lead time is already six months, it is practically impossible for the distributor to request a delivery date sooner to bear the expedited delivery.",

        "section": "Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor ('Warranty Period'). 'Installation' of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications.",
        "explanation": "There is an ambiguity in text related to the warranty. The contract specifies a warranty period based on both installation and shipment dates. If installation is delayed significantly after shipment, the effective warranty period could be substantially reduced. This introduces ambiguity as to the customer's actual warranty coverage, as it hinges on the timing of installation which is a variable timeline.",

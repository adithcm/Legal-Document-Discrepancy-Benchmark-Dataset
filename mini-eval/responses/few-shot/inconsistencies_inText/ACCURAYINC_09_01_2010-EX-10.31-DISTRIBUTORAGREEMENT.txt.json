        "explanation": "The term 'worldwide distributor' creates ambiguity when read in conjunction with other sections. Section 4.4 suggests limitations on Accuray's direct presence or existing distributors, implying constraints that contradict the 'worldwide' scope. This needs clarification.",

        "explanation": "The agreement states the contract for the sale of products is between the distributor and customer, yet section 5.5 states 'In the event that full payment is not received by Accuray, Accuray shall not be liable to Distributor for any margin or commission unless and until it has received payment of amounts sufficient to cover the costs incurred by Accuray to provide the applicable Products to Distributor and the applicable Services to Customer (\"Accuray Cost\").'.

        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "The agreement defines the distributor as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens. This definition is broad, encompassing Siemens, its affiliates, and any third party granted distribution rights by Siemens. However, the repeated emphasis on 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases' limits the scope of the distributorship, creating a potential contradiction if Siemens or its affiliates engage in distribution activities outside of these specific types of purchases. The agreement should clarify whether Siemens or its affiliates can distribute the products independently outside these bundled purchase scenarios.",

Such determination shall be made in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Schedule 2.3.2 attached hereto. If Accuray approves the issuance of a Quote, Accuray shall issue a Quote to Distributor based on the Product configuration and Services requested by the Customer, including pricing for such Products and Services as provided in Section 2.2 above.",
        "explanation": "Schedule 2.3.2 states that Accuray has 5 business days to approve or disapprove a purchase, and failure to respond constitutes disapproval. This timeline is not mentioned in Section 2.3.2 itself, but rather exists as an external document. This could be problematic. Furthermore, the approval can be withheld on various reasons, including 'Bona fide concerns about the suitability of the proposed purchaser' which is very ambiguous. This could be used to shut down anything without any real explaination.",

        "section": "Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains inconsistencies in text. While it suggests Accuray bears expedited delivery costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the order submission, this contradicts Section 2.4, which states Accuray's standard lead time is six months. This creates a misalignment because if the standard lead time is six months, any requested delivery within that timeframe would necessitate expedited shipping, potentially shifting responsibility for costs.",

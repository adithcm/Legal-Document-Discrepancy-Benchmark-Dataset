        "section": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall aim to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (MAOV) of [***] (Units) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV may be [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, subject to commercial aseptic production at Heritages [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019.",
        "explanation": "The text states the MAOV 'may be' [***] units, which introduces ambiguity. 'May be' suggests it's not a definite requirement but conditional. This lack of clarity on the MAOV makes it difficult to determine obligations.",

        "explanation": "The use of 'likely purchase' introduces a significant ambiguity. Unlike the earlier MAOV language ('shall aim to purchase'), 'likely purchase' suggests no firm commitment at all, which undermines the purpose of setting a minimum order volume.",

        "explanation": "This section stipulates that the MAOV is contingent on Premier's approval of Heritage's facility by January 1, 2019. If Premier doesn't approve the facility by this date, the MAOV term becomes unclear or potentially unenforceable for periods after July 1, 2019. The contract doesn't specify an alternative plan or revised MAOV if this condition isn't met, creating a structural flaw in the MAOV requirements.",

        "section": "Heritage shall produce the products described on Schedule A attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to time (the Products), for Premier at [***] Heritages or Heritages wholly owned subsidiary, Jaspers, [***] (the Facilities). [***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Facility. Any facility that Heritage wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the Products must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. For the avoidance of doubt, Heritages [***] facility must be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the Products. Such facility approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Premiers facility approval will be based, in part, on the successful completion of a trial production run that is sufficient in meeting finished product specifications, and an evaluation of the stability and specifications of trial production product within [***] of the trial production run.",
        "explanation": "The text states that any facility Heritage wishes to use, other than [***], must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. However, it later specifies that Heritages [***] facility must be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the Products. This is redundant and confusing because the [***] facility should already be covered by the initial requirement.",

        "section": "Premier represents and warrants that it owns or otherwise has the right to use all trademarks (the Trademarks) and copyrighted material (the Copyrights) provided by Premier to Heritage, which are provided solely for use in connection with the manufacture or packaging of the Products. Heritage will not, and will ensure that Jasper does not, use any of the Trademarks or any marks that are confusingly similar to, or likely to cause confusion with regard to, the Trademarks or Copyrights owned or licensed by Premier for any other purpose without the prior written consent of Premier in each instance. Provided, however, that the foregoing covenant shall not be construed to restrict or prohibit Heritage from using any trademark, trade name, trade dress, labeling or packaging that Heritage is using in commerce as of the date of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 5 is intended to or does preclude Premier from enforcing any of its intellectual property rights, including without limitation, its trademark rights.",
        "explanation": "The text includes a non-restrictive clause that allows Heritage to use any trademark, trade name, trade dress, labeling, or packaging that Heritage is using in commerce as of the date of this Agreement. This creates ambiguity because it's unclear if this clause applies only to Heritages pre-existing trademarks or if it also includes trademarks similar to Premiers. This could lead to disputes regarding trademark infringement.",

Any and all action to be taken in connection with a Recall Action shall be in accordance with FDA policies and other applicable laws and regulations. Heritage shall bear all costs, fees and out-of-pocket expenses associated with any Recall Action which results from (i) Heritages or Jaspers negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) Heritages or Jaspers failure to comply with Product Specifications or the Post Holdings Quality Expectations Manual set forth on Schedule A, (iii) any breach of this Agreement by Heritage or (iv) ingredients or packaging materials purchased by Heritage or Jasper. In all other cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action.",
        "explanation": "The text has an Omission issue. The text does not clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each party in determining the cause of a recall, which is essential to determine who bears the costs. Without a clear process for determining the cause of the recall, disputes may arise over financial responsibilities.",

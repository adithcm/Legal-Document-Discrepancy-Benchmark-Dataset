Capitalized terms that are not explicitly defined in this Agreement may be interpreted based on common industry usage, irrespective of definitions found in the Stock Purchase Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'irrespective of definitions found in the Stock Purchase Agreement' is contradictory. It creates confusion as to whether the definitions in the Stock Purchase Agreement should be considered if a term is undefined in the Intellectual Property Agreement, which contradicts the general principle that related agreements should be read in harmony.",

        "explanation": "The terms for sublicensing are asymmetric and unclear. Arizona can sublicense to third parties in support of its business, but the Company's ability to sublicense to third parties requires 'reasonable justification,' which is not defined.

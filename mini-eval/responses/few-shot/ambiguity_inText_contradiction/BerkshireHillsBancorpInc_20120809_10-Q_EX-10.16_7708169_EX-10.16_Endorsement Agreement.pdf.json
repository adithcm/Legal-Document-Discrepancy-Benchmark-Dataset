        "section": "a) CONTRACT PERIOD means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties and terminating on May 31, 2016 unless sooner terminated under this Agreement. b) SERVICES PERIOD means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties and terminating on May 31, 2014 unless sooner terminated under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of clause 6(a) regarding Auriemma's availability for appearances, the Services Period shall extend to May 31, 2015.",
        "explanation": "There's an inconsistency between the Contract Period and the Services Period. The Services Period is defined to end on May 31, 2014, but then it's extended to May 31, 2015, for appearance purposes under clause 6(a). This could lead to confusion about the overall Services Period, affecting other clauses tied to it.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'subject only to approval by the University of Connecticut department of athletics and consulting office' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear what happens if the University of Connecticut approval is not granted. Does the entire agreement become void, or does Auriemma have an obligation to resolve any issues to obtain approval? This creates uncertainty regarding enforceability.",

        "section": "27. ARBITRATION. Any dispute or difference between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association by a panel of three qualified arbitrators... All arbitration proceedings or litigation (to the extent the remedy requested is not, by law, available through arbitration [e.g., injunctive relief]) relating to any claims or disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the county in which the principal executive office of the party not initiating such action or proceeding defendant or responding party) is located. The parties irrevocably submit and consent to the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over each of the parties by the federal and/or state courts in such jurisdiction (the Selected Jurisdiction).",
        "explanation": "This section contains a structural flaw by mixing mandatory arbitration with the allowance of litigation for remedies not available through arbitration (e.g., injunctive relief). It then specifies that both arbitration and litigation will occur in the same county (where the defendant's principal office is located) and that the parties consent to jurisdiction in the federal and state courts of that jurisdiction. It's structurally flawed because if arbitration is meant to be the primary method of dispute resolution, the litigation clause creates unnecessary confusion.",

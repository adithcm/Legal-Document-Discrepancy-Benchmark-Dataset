Upon expiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were before the Second Amendment Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Partys right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall survive the Second Amendments expiration.",
        "explanation": "While the amendment expires on December 31, 2021, the right to enforce its terms survives expiration. This creates ambiguity: if the underlying agreement's terms revert to their pre-amendment state, what specific terms from the expired amendment can still be enforced, and for how long? This could lead to disputes over which provisions remain active post-expiration.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Products' includes 'each individual unit of Product Unit,' which is redundant and confusing. It's unclear why 'Product Unit' is further defined as 'each individual unit of Product Unit' rather than a more straightforward description. This creates ambiguity in the terminology.",

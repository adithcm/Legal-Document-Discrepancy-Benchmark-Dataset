        "explanation": "The agreement states that the term continues in perpetuity, but then includes a clause allowing for early termination. This creates a contradiction, as perpetuity implies no end.",

        "explanation": "This places a responsibility on CHT to monitor the system and notify Ehave. However, Section 6(f)(iii) states Ehave does not purport to monitor End User Data. This is an inconsistency, as CHT is expected to report issues that Ehave itself does not monitor.",

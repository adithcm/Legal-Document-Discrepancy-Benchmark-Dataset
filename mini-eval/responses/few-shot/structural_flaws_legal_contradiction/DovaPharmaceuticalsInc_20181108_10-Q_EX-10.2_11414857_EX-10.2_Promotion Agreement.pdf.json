        "section": "During the Term, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Dova hereby grants to Valeant the right, on a co-exclusive basis (solely with Dova and its Affiliates), to Detail and promote the Product in the Specialty in the Territory in the Field, and to conduct the Valeant Activities and the activities of the institutional account management team (pursuant to and subject to the terms of Section 4.1.5) for the Product in the Territory in the Field in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dova retains and reserves the right for Dova and its Affiliates to promote the Product in the Territory including in the Specialty.",
        "explanation": "The granting of a co-exclusive right to Valeant is immediately followed by a statement that Dova retains the right to promote the product 'including in the Specialty'. This creates ambiguity. If Dova's right is truly unlimited, the 'co-exclusive' nature of Valeant's right is undermined.",

        "explanation": "This sets a deadline for creating a pharmacovigilance agreement but does not specify the consequences if that agreement is not finalized by the deadline. It creates an omission. If the agreement isn't in place, patient safety could be compromised, but there is no clarity on the repercussions for failing to meet the deadline.",

        "explanation": "While Dova has sole responsibility for these activities, there is an omission in clarifying how Valeant should handle or document the orders it transmits to Dova. There is no provision to account for how these activities would be tracked and recorded by Valeant to protect both parties.",

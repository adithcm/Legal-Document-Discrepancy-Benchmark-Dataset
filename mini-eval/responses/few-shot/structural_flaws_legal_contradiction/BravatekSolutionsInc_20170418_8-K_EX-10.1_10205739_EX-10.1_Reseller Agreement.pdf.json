During the Term hereof and for a period of six (6) months following the termination of this Agreement or the discontinuation of any of the Company Products, (i) the Reseller shall have the exclusive right to commission for any Registered Referrals, (ii) the Company shall not market, promote, sell, or distribute Company Products or solicit or procure orders for the Company Products, or for any product(s) or service(s) similar to the Company Products, in the Territory other than through the Reseller and pursuant to this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Reseller, and (iii) without limitation to the foregoing, the Company shall not, directly or through other parties (whether agents, representatives, intermediaries, resellers or other parties), market, promote, sell, distribute, solicit or procure orders to any existing or prospective customer of the Reseller.",
        "explanation": "The exclusivity clause in Section 5 is broad. Specifically, (iii) restricts Company from marketing to any existing or prospective customer of Reseller without defining what constitutes a 'prospective customer.' This vagueness could overly restrict Company's ability to operate independently after termination.",

RESELLER SHALL MAKE NO REPRESENTATION, GUARANTEE, OR WARRANTY CONCERNING THE COMPANY PRODUCT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED IN ADVANCE BY COMPANY IN WRITING. TO THE EXTENT THE RESELLER HAS COMPLIED WITH THE OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE COMPANY SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE RESELLER FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE RESELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES (WHETHER DIRECTLY OR IN CONNECTION WITH A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY) AS A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY PRODUCTS.

        "explanation": "The warranty disclaimer limits Reseller's ability to make representations about the product. However, the subsequent indemnification clauses create asymmetry. While the Company indemnifies Reseller for product-related losses if Reseller complies with Section 8, the Reseller's indemnification of the Company is not conditioned on the Company's compliance with any particular obligations. This could be viewed as unfair.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Initial Term' refers to clause 12.1, which discusses the effects of termination, not the definition or duration of the initial term itself. The actual duration of the initial term is found in clause 11.1, creating a misdirection and confusion.",

        "explanation": "The payment term specifies 'thirty (45) days,' creating ambiguity. It's unclear whether the payment is due in 30 or 45 days, or if there's a range, thus contradicting itself.",

        "explanation": "While the agreement states it is governed by Ohio law, the phrase 'but jurisdiction will be determined on a case-by-case basis' introduces uncertainty. It is unclear under what circumstances a court in a different jurisdiction might be appropriate, conflicting with the intention of the governing law clause.",

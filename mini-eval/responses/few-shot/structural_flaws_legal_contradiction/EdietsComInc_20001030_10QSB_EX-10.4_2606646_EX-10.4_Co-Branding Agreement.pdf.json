        "section": "During the Term, Women.com agrees to give eDiets the right of first refusal to participate in all diet and diet-counseling related promotion opportunities created or otherwise made available by Women.com on channels or sub-channels created after the Effective Date of this Agreement, including sponsorships, anchor placements and any other content integration opportunities (\"Diet Promos\"). If Women.com proposes to create and make available Diet Promos after the Effective Date, it shall give eDiets written notice of its intention, describing the terms and conditions of participation in the Diet Promos. eDiets shall have fifteen (15) days from the giving of such notice to agree to participate in the applicable Diet Promo upon the terms and conditions specified in the notice by giving written notice of its agreement to Women.com.",
        "explanation": "The term 'right of first refusal' implies that eDiets can match any offer Women.com receives from a third party. However, the clause only requires Women.com to provide notice of the promotion with its terms and conditions, and eDiets must agree to *those* terms. If eDiets does not find those terms acceptable, they cannot negotiate or propose different terms, which significantly weakens the 'right of first refusal'. This discrepancy between the common understanding of the term and its implementation in the contract creates ambiguity.",

        "section": "Women.com shall make advertising reports generated by NetGravity available to eDiets either online or in some other mutually agreed upon format. Such reports shall contain the number of impressions and other metrics attributable to each general category of advertising specified in Exhibit B hereto, as well as such other information as eDiets may reasonably request, to the extent reasonable commercial efforts and current technology permit. eDiets agrees to accept such advertising reports provided by Women.com as the official basis for measuring all services to be provided under this Agreement, provided, however, that if the traffic data contained in such reports materially differs (meaning a differential of 25% or more), from the data captured and reported by eDiets, the parties agree to either (a) identify the source of and remedy the difference or (b) equally split the difference between the traffic data reported by each party.",
        "explanation": "The options provided when there's a 25% or more discrepancy in traffic data are problematic. Requiring the parties to 'equally split the difference' does not clarify which metrics or data source is actually correct and may lead to financial disputes. It's unclear how the equally split data will affect payments, campaign performance evaluation, or future strategies.",

        "explanation": "This clause is internally inconsistent and structurally flawed. It states the agreement is governed by Delaware law as applied to Delaware residents, but then attempts to exclude any California choice of law principles that might lead to the application of a non-Delaware law. This creates ambiguity and confusion regarding which state's laws will govern the agreement, particularly since the parties are located in California and Florida, not Delaware. The exclusion of California's choice of law is unusual and could be problematic. It is more typical to choose a state and apply its laws, including its conflict of laws rules.",

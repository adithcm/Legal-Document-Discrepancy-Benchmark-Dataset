        "section": "During the Term of this Agreement, FCE will not conduct any Work using Generation 1 Technology in Carbon Capture Applications or any Work using Generation 2 Technology, independently or with third parties outside this Agreement, without prior written approval from ExxonMobil. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ExxonMobil hereby grants approval for FCE solely to conduct Authorized Work using Generation 1 Technology with Authorized Third Parties for Carbon Capture Applications and any Work using Generation 2 Technology solely for Power Applications and Hydrogen Applications.",
        "explanation": "This section includes contradictory terms. The first sentence restricts FCE from conducting work with Generation 1 Technology in Carbon Capture Applications or Generation 2 Technology without prior approval. However, the subsequent sentence grants FCE approval to conduct Authorized Work with Authorized Third Parties using Generation 1 Technology for Carbon Capture Applications and any Work using Generation 2 Technology solely for Power Applications and Hydrogen Applications. It's not clear if the 'notwithstanding' clause provides a complete exception or if the initial restriction still applies, leading to ambiguity.",

        "section": "ExxonMobil grants FCE a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable (except pursuant to Article 14 (Assignment)), non-sub-licensable (except as set forth in this Paragraph 7.01(a)) right and license to practice Program Results solely to conduct research and development for the Program. More particularly, said right and license to practice includes the right to use, reproduce, and create derivative works of Program Information under applicable copyrights and to make, use, and import (but not sell or offer to sell) under the claims of Program Patents, in each case solely for research and development for the Program. Said right and license may be extended to contractors performing work on behalf of FCE but is not otherwise sub-licensable.",
        "explanation": "This section grants a non-sub-licensable license to FCE but then indicates that the right and license may be extended to contractors performing work on behalf of FCE. This creates ambiguity around whether extending the license to contractors constitutes sublicensing, or if it is an exception to the sublicensing restriction.",

        "section": "ExxonMobil has the unencumbered right to file or not to file, prosecute, defend, maintain, abandon, or enforce any Program Invention or Program Patent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event ExxonMobil decides not to prosecute, defend, enforce, maintain or decides to abandon any Program Patent, then ExxonMobil will provide notice thereof to FCE, and FCE will then have the right, but not the obligation, to prosecute or maintain the Program Patent and sole responsibility for the continuing costs, taxes, legal fees, maintenance fees and other fees associated with that Program Patent. The ownership of such Program Patent will remain with ExxonMobil.",
        "explanation": "The combination of ExxonMobil having 'unencumbered right' to abandon a patent and FCE having the 'right, but not the obligation' to maintain it creates a structural flaw. If FCE chooses to maintain the abandoned patent, it does so at its own expense, yet ownership remains with ExxonMobil. This creates a scenario where FCE invests in an asset it does not own and from which ExxonMobil could potentially benefit without contributing, rendering the terms structurally flawed from FCE's perspective.",

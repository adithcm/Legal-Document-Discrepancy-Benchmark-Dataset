        "explanation": "The conditions for the agreement to become effective are vague. Specifically, it is ambigious as to what happens if ETON does not execute a commerical supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization due to reasons other than the refusal of the manufacturing organization to sign an agreement. This creates uncertainity around the agreement's validity and enforceability",

        "explanation": "The clause states that a party can assign the agreement to a third party or affiliate in the event of a merger, consolidation, or change of control. However, it doesn't clarify whether the other party's consent is required if the assignee is a direct competitor of the other party, potentially creating a situation that harms the non-assigning party's business interests. This is an omission of a critical consideration regarding competitive relationships, which needs to be addressed.",

        "section": "WHEREAS, the Blockchain Administrator will also serve as the Fund's investment adviser (the \"Adviser\") pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement entered into by and between the Fund and the Adviser (as amended from time to time, the \"Advisory Agreement\") and WHEREAS, the Fund bears all costs and expenses incurred in its operation, administration and transactions which are not specifically assumed by the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement or this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces ambiguity. It states the Blockchain Administrator also serves as the Fund's investment advisor. However, it's unclear if the 'Adviser' mentioned later is the same entity as the 'Blockchain Administrator' acting as an investment advisor. This creates a potential source of confusion.",

        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency. It first states the Blockchain Administrator will furnish advice and recommendations regarding the fund's business and affairs. However, it then explicitly prohibits the Blockchain Administrator from providing advice on securities, retaining, or selling securities, which contradicts the initial statement.",

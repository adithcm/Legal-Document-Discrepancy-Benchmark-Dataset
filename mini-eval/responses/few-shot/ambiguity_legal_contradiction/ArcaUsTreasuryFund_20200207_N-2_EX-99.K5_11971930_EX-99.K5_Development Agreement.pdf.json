        "section": "WHEREAS, the Blockchain Administrator will also serve as the Fund's investment adviser (the \"Adviser\") pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement entered into by and between the Fund and the Adviser (as amended from time to time, the \"Advisory Agreement\") and WHEREAS, the Fund bears all costs and expenses incurred in its operation, administration and transactions which are not specifically assumed by the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement or this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section implies a contradiction regarding the Blockchain Administrator's roles. It states the Blockchain Administrator will also serve as the Fund's investment advisor which suggests that the two roles are independent of each other, and should each other have their own separate agreement. The costs and expenses are assumed between the Adviser and the Blockchain Administrator but this implies that they are not one and the same, which is a contradiction. This also suggests that the Blockchain Administrator and Adviser are also operating with two different legal guidelines and constraints which is not structured properly.",

        "explanation": "This section excludes indemnification for criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, which are standard exclusions. However, 'reckless disregard' is ambiguous and may overlap with gross negligence, leading to potential disputes about the scope of the indemnification exclusion. The ambiguity exists because 'reckless disregard' is more difficult to define precisely than 'gross negligence' and can lead to subjective interpretation, which is an ambiguity in legal terms.",

        "explanation": "The terminology 'Investment Fund Act' is a generic term and could refer to multiple pieces of legislation. The more proper term should be Investment Company Act of 1940. This is an ambiguity in legal terms.",

        "explanation": "The provision grants plan_b rights to distribute via its 'partner's platform,' but the term 'partner' is not defined. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over which entities qualify as partners and the extent of plan_b's distribution rights.",

LICENSOR shall pay all damages awarded in a trial to a third Party.",
        "explanation": "While the Licensor warrants non-infringement and provides indemnification, the scope is unclear. It specifies 'agreed country of delivery or use,' but Appendix 2 states the territory is 'Worldwide.' This creates a conflict: is the warranty applicable worldwide, or does it require specification of a particular country?",

        "explanation": "The Agreement states that it's governed by the laws of the United States of America, but specifies jurisdiction in New York City, New York. Given that the Licensor is based in Houston, Texas, and plan_b is in Cologne, Germany, the choice of New York law and jurisdiction might be inconvenient and should potentially specify which state law applies if US Federal law isn't intended.",

NCM shall depreciate the cost of the NCM Equipment on a calendar quarterly basis, provided that the method used will result in full depreciation at the end of the five-year period commencing on the Effective Date. Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason, Network Affiliate shall pay NCM the value of the NCM Equipment, if any, that remains on NCMs financial statements as of the time of such expiration or termination. Upon payment of such amount to NCM by Network Affiliate at the time of such expiration or termination, NCMs ownership interest in the NCM Equipment will transfer to Network Affiliate.",
        "explanation": "There is a structural flaw in the text. If the equipment is fully depreciated, then according to the text there is no value and the network affiliate will pay NCM nothing. However, in the event of early termination, it is unclear if NCM will be able to recoup the cost of their equipment if they terminate early.",

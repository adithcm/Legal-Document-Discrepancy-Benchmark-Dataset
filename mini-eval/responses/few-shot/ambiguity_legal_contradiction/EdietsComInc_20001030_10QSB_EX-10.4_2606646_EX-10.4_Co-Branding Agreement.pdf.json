The Diet Center shall be branded with an icon that includes the eDiets logo. There will be no Women.com or eDiets registration required to enter and use the Gateway Page of the Diet Center.",
        "explanation": "The requirement for the Gateway Page to have the look and feel of Women.com Sites while also being branded with the eDiets logo presents a potential conflict. Balancing the branding of both entities on a single page could lead to a diluted or confusing user experience, creating ambiguity in visual representation.",

        "explanation": "The language regarding making up for under-delivered impressions is inconsistent. The text says 11,250,000 per quarter equals 45,000,000 per year. It also says 3,250,000 per quarter equals 13,000,000 per year and 3,000,000 per quarter equals 12,000,000 per year. These numbers don't accurately reflect quarterly to yearly conversion. 11,250,000 x 4 = 45,000,000; 3,250,000 x 4 = 13,000,000; 3,000,000 x 4 = 12,000,000",

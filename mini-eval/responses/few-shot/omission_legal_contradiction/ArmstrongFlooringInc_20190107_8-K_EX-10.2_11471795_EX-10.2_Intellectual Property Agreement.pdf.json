        "explanation": "The definition of Arizona Licensed Copyrights seems to imply that copyrights not 'used or held for use' are excluded, potentially leading to disputes over which copyrights are actually licensed. It could be clarified to include all copyrights relevant to the Company Field.",

        "explanation": "There's a structural flaw. While subsections (i), (ii), and (iii) list specific terms for trademarks, subsection (iv) abruptly shifts to 'Copyrights, Know-How and Patents' being 'in perpetuity' without defining those terms. It's not clearly structured, as the term of the entire agreement vs. the individual terms of the agreement need to be defined.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non- exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), non-assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world only in the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in the form set forth on Schedule 6.1.",
        "explanation": "The limitation on using Arizona Licensed Trademarks 'only in the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing' is vague. 'As of the Closing' may not be well-defined or easily determinable, and could create disputes over authorized use. Schedule 6.1 attempts to further define this term. Schedule 6.1 states that the Armstrong logo cannot be used alone.",

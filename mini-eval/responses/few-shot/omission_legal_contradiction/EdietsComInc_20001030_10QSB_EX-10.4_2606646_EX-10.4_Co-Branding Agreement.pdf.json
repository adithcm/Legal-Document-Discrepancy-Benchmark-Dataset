        "section": "During the Term, eDiets will not buy, sell, display or distribute advertising from (including, but not limited to, banner ads, buttons, badges, text links, hyperlinks or editorial mentions) or otherwise promote any Women.com Compettive Company on any page of the eDiets Site that is within two clicks from the Gateway Page of the Diet Center.",
        "explanation": "This clause restricts eDiets from promoting competitors of Women.com near the Diet Center on eDiets' own site. The term 'two clicks' is ambiguously defined, particularly in the context of a website. It's unclear what constitutes a 'click' or how this restriction is applied to complex site navigation or dynamic content, which can lead to disputes.",

        "explanation": "While Section 5.1 generally prohibits Women.com from promoting eDiets' competitors within the Diet Center, exceptions are made for Jenny Craig for mini-sites and promotions. This creates an inconsistency; although Jenny Craig is listed as a competitor, they are still receiving favorable treatment on Women.com, which potentially diminishes eDiets' exclusivity.",

        "explanation": "The clause addresses over-reporting of impressions due to technical malfunction, obligating Women.com to deliver equivalent impressions. However, it refers to Section 3.1 for under-delivery provisions, which may not fully address the unique circumstances of over-reporting leading to an inflated perception of delivered value, thus creating ambiguity in the remedy.",

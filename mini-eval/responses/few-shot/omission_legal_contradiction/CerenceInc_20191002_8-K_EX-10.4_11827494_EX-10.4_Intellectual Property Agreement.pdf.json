        "explanation": "While this 'WHEREAS' clause states IP allocation has occurred, the operative sections (Articles III and IV) grant licenses, implying continued shared usage. This creates a structural flaw because allocation suggests exclusive ownership, conflicting with the shared use framework of the licenses.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable (subject to Section 3.01(g)) license under the Nuance Patents, solely to the extent that claims of the Nuance Patents cover products or services of the SpinCo Business in the SpinCo Field of Use, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit such products and services, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof.",
        "explanation": "The granting of a perpetual and irrevocable license could be problematic because it may conflict with unforeseen future changes in law or business circumstances. A perpetual license, while seemingly advantageous, can become a liability if the underlying technology becomes obsolete or if business needs drastically change.",

In the event a Party divests a line of business or line of products or services by (a) spinning off a member of its Group by its sale or other disposition to a Third Party, (b) reducing ownership or control in a member of its Group so that it no longer qualifiers as a member of its Group under this Agreement, (c) selling or otherwise transferring such line of business, products or services to a Third Party or (d) forming a joint venture with a Third Party with respect to such line of business, products or services (each such divested entity or line of business, products or services, a Divested Entity), the Divested Entity shall retain those licenses granted to it under this Agreement, provided that the license shall be limited to the business, products or services (as applicable) of the Divested Entity as of the date of divestment and such natural development thereof within the Nuance Field of Use (where Nuance is the divesting Party) or SpinCo Field of Use (where SpinCo is the divesting party).",
        "explanation": "The language 'natural development thereof' in the context of retaining licenses for divested businesses is ambiguous. It lacks clear boundaries on what constitutes 'natural development,' potentially leading to disputes over the scope of permitted use post-divestiture.",

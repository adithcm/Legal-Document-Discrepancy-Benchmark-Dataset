        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section specifies that if the launch date hasn't occurred within 4 months of the effective date due to a lack of good faith efforts from *both* parties, then *either* party can terminate. However, it then states that if only *one* party has used good faith efforts, *only that party* may terminate. This creates a contradiction: if neither party used good faith efforts, the first sentence seems to imply either can terminate, which conflicts with the more restrictive condition in the second sentence limiting termination to only the party who used good faith efforts.",

Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "The Force Majeure clause states that a party is excused from performance due to events beyond their control. However, it also states that this does not limit obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification) with respect to third-party claims. This creates a potential contradiction. For example, if i-Escrow's service delivery is delayed due to a force majeure event, and a customer sues 2TheMart because of this delay, Section 9 says i-Escrow must still indemnify 2TheMart, even though the delay was caused by something beyond i-Escrow's control.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This renewal clause contains a significant contradiction. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement. However, the subsequent sentence states that if *either* party fails to provide notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before expiration, the agreement is *automatically* renewed. This contradicts the requirement for mutual written agreement and creates ambiguity: does the contract require both parties to agree, or will the lack of a non-renewal notice from either party suffice for automatic renewal?",

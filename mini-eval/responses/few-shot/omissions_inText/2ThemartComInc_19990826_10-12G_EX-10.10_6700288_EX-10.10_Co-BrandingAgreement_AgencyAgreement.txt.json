        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination if an SOW isn't agreed upon within 2 months of the Effective Date. However, Section 2.3 states that if the Launch Date (dependent on the Information Transfer Mechanism, which is defined in the SOW) hasn't occurred within 4 months, either party can terminate. It is inconsistent to allow termination if SOW hasn't been agreed in 2 months, but also allowing for a launch date to be 4 months away.",

A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The renewal clause contains contradictory statements. It first states that renewal requires a mutual written agreement, but then adds that the agreement automatically renews if no notice is given. This creates confusion about whether explicit agreement is needed or if inaction leads to renewal. It is unclear if lack of action constitutes a mutual written agreement.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' is ambiguous and could significantly limit the scope of indemnification. It's unclear what actions or relationships would cause one party to be 'deemed a principal' of the other and creates confusion.",

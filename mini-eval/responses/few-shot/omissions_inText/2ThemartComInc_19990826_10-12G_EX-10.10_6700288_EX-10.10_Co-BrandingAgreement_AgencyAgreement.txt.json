        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. Once approved, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently implement their respective obligations under the SOW.",
        "explanation": "There is an ambiguity in how the parties are expected to act if they cannot agree to an SOW within two months. The text provides that either party may terminate in its sole discretion. This is in contradiction to other clauses in the document that require action in 'good faith' showing misaligned text that will cause issues of enforcement.",

(b) By adding links to Co-Branded Site in FAQ section of 2TheMart auctions. (c) By adding links to Co-Branded Site on the seller listing pages of 2TheMart auctions.

        "explanation": "The language in section 3 is not correctly structured. By using parenthetical letters to create lists within the section, this can cause structural flaws and inconsistencies.

        "explanation": "The text and wording in this section is not structurally sound. The phrase 'i-Escrow Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 Content' is not a real phrase and shows a break in the document. The text is not clear about what liability i-Escrow takes with its content in relation to claims, loses, and costs, especially because this sentence is broken and does not end well. This structural flaw will cause legal problems of enforcement.",

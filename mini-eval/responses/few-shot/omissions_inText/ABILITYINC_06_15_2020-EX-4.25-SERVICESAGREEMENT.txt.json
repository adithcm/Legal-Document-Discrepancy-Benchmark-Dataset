        "explanation": "The Agreement states that it is entered into on October 1, 2019, but made effective as of November 1, 2019. This discrepancy in dates could lead to confusion regarding when the actual terms of the agreement become enforceable.

        "explanation": "This section is overly broad regarding the ownership of intellectual property. It stipulates that Recipient owns all rights to any invention, technique, etc. made by Provider which results from the Services. This could create a conflict if the Provider independently develops an invention outside the scope of the services that are similar to the services. Also, it fails to address what happens if the Provider already had existing intellectual property that is necessary to perform the services.",

The section states, 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.' The text is not grammatically correct and has unnecessary words that make it hard to read.",

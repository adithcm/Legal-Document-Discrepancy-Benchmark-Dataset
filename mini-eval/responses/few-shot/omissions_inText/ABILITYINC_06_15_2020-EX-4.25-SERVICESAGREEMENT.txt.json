        "explanation": "The definition of \"Recipient\" includes two distinct companies, TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd. This creates ambiguity, as the agreement later refers to 'Recipient' as a singular entity, potentially leading to confusion about which company the clauses apply to, especially concerning obligations and rights.",

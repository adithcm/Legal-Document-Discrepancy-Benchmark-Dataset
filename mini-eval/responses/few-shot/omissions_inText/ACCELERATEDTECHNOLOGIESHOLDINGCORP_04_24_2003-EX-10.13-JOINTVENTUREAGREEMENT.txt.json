(\"PVSS\"), (the \"Parties\" or \"Joint Venturers\" if referred to collectively, or the \"Party\" or Joint Venturer\" if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\"), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states that the parties are associating as 'business associates, and not as partners' but then refers to them as 'Joint Venturers.' While attempting to disclaim a formal partnership, the use of 'Joint Venturers' implies a partnership-like relationship, creating a potential ambiguity. This contradiction is further amplified by the repeated use of 'joint venture' throughout the document, a term often associated with partnership principles. This creates an ambiguity around the actual legal structure intended and could affect liability and fiduciary duties.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces ambiguity because it lacks specifics. The statement that 'Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions as needed' fails to define the process for determining 'need,' the method for calculating the amount of required contribution from each party, and the consequences of failure to contribute. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over funding obligations and creates a situation where one party might claim the other is not fulfilling its financial obligations to the venture.",

        "explanation": "While the intent to elect out of Subchapter K is clear, the phrase 'if necessary' is ambiguous. It is unclear under what circumstances filing the appropriate documentation would be deemed 'necessary.' Best practice dictates the documentation for the election should always be filed to avoid any ambiguity with the IRS.",

        "explanation": "The Term of Contract Clause has an ambiguity. The start date is defined, but the end date is not properly defined in the agreement, with the day and month being [*****]. This makes it impossible to fully determine the length of the contract, and there is no reference as to where this information can be found.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This clause contradicts itself. The beginning of the text discusses satisfactory record of play and what that means, but then goes on to describe SPGA and/or PGA tour events. There is no clarification on what a satisfactory record of play is, and it becomes an ambiguity in the text.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause creates a legal contradiction. Requiring repayment from the Consultant's estate in the event of death may conflict with state laws regarding estate administration and creditor claims. The enforceability of such a provision depends on whether it's considered a valid debt against the estate, and if it improperly prioritizes ADAMS GOLF's claim over other creditors or family allowances.",

        "explanation": "The contract period isn't fully defined, which introduces ambiguity. The number of years and months are redacted, and the termination date is also redacted. This lack of clarity makes it impossible to determine the exact duration of the agreement.

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1.

        "explanation": "This section outlines the minimum number of tournaments Consultant needs to play, and the repayment schedule if that number is not met. However, the specific number of tournaments required and the repayment amounts for each year are redacted. This creates ambiguity, as the core obligations and financial penalties related to tournament participation are not clearly defined, potentially leading to disputes over performance requirements and financial obligations.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause outlines termination conditions if the consultant dies or becomes unable to play, but it does not specify what happens if consultant is unable to perform some of the obligations of the contract, but is still able to play tour golf. Therefore, what is being asked of the consultant during that time is ambigious and will lead to confusion.",

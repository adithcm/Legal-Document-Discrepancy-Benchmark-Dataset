        "section": "1.4. \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" means a purchase.",
        "explanation": "This definition is structurally flawed and circular. It defines the term as simply 'a purchase,' which provides no meaningful information or context. This lack of clarity undermines the purpose of defining the term and creates potential ambiguity in interpreting other sections of the agreement that reference it.",

Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines a specific method for a Quote or Purchase Order to supersede the main agreement, requiring signatures from specific high-level executives. However, it is possible that a duly authorized representative of Accuray could modify the purchase order through written agreement, per section 12.2. This section states 'Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, Distributor and Accuray may agree, by execution of a written agreement, to modify any term or provision of this Agreement'. This is a contradiction to section 2.3.4.",

Shipment. ...Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This creates ambiguity around force majeure. It suggests that Accuray is responsible for expedited shipping costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission. This seems absolute, yet Section 12.13 states that neither party is responsible for failures in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, which might include shipping delays caused by weather or other external factors. It is unclear if Accuray is responsible for paying for expedited shipping costs when the delay is outside of its control due to force majeure.",

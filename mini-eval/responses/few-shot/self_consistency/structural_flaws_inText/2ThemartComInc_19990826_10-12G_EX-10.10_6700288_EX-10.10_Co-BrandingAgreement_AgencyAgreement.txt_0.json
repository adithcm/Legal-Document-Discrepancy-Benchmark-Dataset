        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the general principle of good faith and fair dealing expected in contractual relationships. Allowing i-Escrow to unilaterally change the per-transaction inquiry rate without 2TheMart's consent creates an imbalance of power and potentially undermines the purpose of the advertising fees. It contradicts the implicit understanding that both parties would negotiate in good faith regarding the payment structure.",

        "explanation": "This is a direct contradiction. It first states that confidential information must be held in confidence, and then immediately allows either party to disclose the confidential information to any third party at any time.

        "explanation": "Section 1.1 defines Accuray Regions to include 'the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, including Australia and other than India and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan' but then restricts the meaning to only North America. This creates an internal contradiction as the definition initially includes multiple regions but is immediately limited to only one.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'Distributor shall make an offer to a Customer based on the Quote provided by Accuray' is followed by 'Submission and acceptance of an order shall be completed pursuant to Section 2.3.3.' This is structurally flawed, because the submission and acceptance of an order does not mean that an offer will be made to a customer",

However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",
        "explanation": "In Section 4.6.1, the text establishes a warranty period of one year after installation (up to 18 months after shipment). The statement, 'However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product' directly contradicts the preceding limited warranty period, because there is no clear definition of what the expected lifetime of the product actually is. This creates uncertainty and could undermine the enforceability of the initial warranty.",

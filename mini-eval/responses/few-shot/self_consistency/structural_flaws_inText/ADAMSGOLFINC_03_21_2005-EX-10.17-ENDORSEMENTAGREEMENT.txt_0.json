Payment of the base compensation will be subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value.",
        "explanation": "The language 'Adams Golf intends to pay' and 'subject to Adams Golf's financial performance and continued evaluation of Consultant's brand value' introduces significant ambiguity and contradictions. It is not a firm commitment to pay the base compensation, making the obligation uncertain and dependent on subjective factors, undermining the enforceability of this clause.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This creates ambiguity around the termination conditions. It's unclear if Adams Golf is also subject to the same repayment terms as Watson if the company terminates the agreement due to Watson's breach.",

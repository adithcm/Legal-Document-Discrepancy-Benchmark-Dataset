        "explanation": "This clause grants unilateral authority to either Joint Venturer to demand capital contributions, which is inconsistent with the general principle of mutual agreement in joint ventures. It contradicts the idea of equal partnership and could lead to disputes if one party imposes unreasonable financial burdens on the other.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the joint venture can be terminated by either party with a 30-day notice, but then also says 'regardless of the original termination date,' implying there may be a prior agreement or understanding regarding the termination date. This is an internal inconsistency and creates ambiguity regarding the duration of the Joint Venture.",

However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
        "explanation": "This section allows a Joint Venturer to unilaterally withdraw funds, but limits the withdrawal to 10% of their capital contribution per quarter. The last sentence, 'All other distributions will adhere to the original terms,' creates ambiguity because 'original terms' is not defined. It is unclear what those 'original terms' are and how they relate to the 10% limit.",

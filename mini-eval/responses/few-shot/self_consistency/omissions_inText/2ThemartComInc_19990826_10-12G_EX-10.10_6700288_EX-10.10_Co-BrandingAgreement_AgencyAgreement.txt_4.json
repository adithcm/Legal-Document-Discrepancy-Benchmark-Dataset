        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. ... In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "These sections provide different deadlines for termination based on failure to agree on the SOW (2 months) and failure to achieve the Launch Date (4 months). These deadlines are inconsistent because the failure to agree on the SOW could easily impact the ability to reach the Launch Date, yet the remedies and timelines are treated separately. It doesn't account for potential overlap or interactions between these two events that might delay launch.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'which shall be at the discretion of 2TheMart' gives 2TheMart complete control over whether i-Escrow can place banner advertising. This could be interpreted as allowing 2TheMart to deny advertising for any reason, even if it harms i-Escrow's ability to generate revenue from the Co-Branded Site. This broad discretion creates ambiguity about the standards or criteria 2TheMart will use, potentially rendering the agreement one-sided.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The language 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year' contradicts the clause that requires 'mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement' for renewal. The automatic renewal provision effectively negates the requirement for mutual written agreement, as it can be triggered by inaction from either party.",

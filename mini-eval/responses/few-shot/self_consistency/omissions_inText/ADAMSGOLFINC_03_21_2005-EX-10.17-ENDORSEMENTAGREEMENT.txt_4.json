        "section": "The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract period section contradicts itself due to redactions. The start date is given as September 1, 2004, but the term's length and the termination date are redacted, making it impossible to determine the actual duration of the agreement or verify that the stated start and (unknown) end dates align with the term length. This introduces ambiguity regarding the contract's duration.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "The repayment obligation upon termination due to death or inability to play contradicts the fundamental principle that an estate's liability is generally limited to the assets of the deceased. Requiring the estate to repay ADAMS GOLF for 'services not performed' when the inability to perform arises from death or disability is arguably unconscionable and may be legally questionable depending on applicable state law regarding contract enforceability against estates, particularly if the repayment would deplete assets needed to satisfy other legal obligations of the estate or dependents. There's a contradiction between the contractual obligation and potentially conflicting legal principles governing estate liability.",

        "section": "In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "The arbitration clause states that the venue shall be in Kansas, yet the applicable law states that the agreement is to be construed according to the laws of the State of Kansas. The contradiction is that the venue should be in Kansas, but the actual legal proceedings are to be determined in accordance to the laws of the State of Kansas. Venue is the place where a legal case will be heard, the laws of the state of Kansas govern the rules and laws to the venue's proceedings.",

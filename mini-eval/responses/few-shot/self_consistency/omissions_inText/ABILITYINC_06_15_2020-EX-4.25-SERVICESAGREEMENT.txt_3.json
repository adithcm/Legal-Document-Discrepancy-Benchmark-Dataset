        "explanation": "The agreement lists TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd as 'Recipient'. However, TELCOSTAR is described as organized under the laws of Singapore and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd is described as organized under the laws of the State of Israel, which is contradictory. Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd is located in Israel, not 'the State of Israel' which would imply a state within the US. The document should clarify each of these as separate entities or clarify which entity is the recipient.",

        "explanation": "There is a structural flaw and likely a typo in the wording of the text, it states 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020'. The second use of 'Agreement' is unnecessary and causes the text to not be properly structured and does not make sense.",

        "explanation": "The governing law of this contract is the domestic laws of the State of Israel per section 7.2. However, the bankruptcy clause is inconsistent with this, as it uses terminology and procedures related to US bankruptcy law ('file a petition in bankruptcy'). The Israeli legal system has its own distinct insolvency laws and procedures, which should be referenced here for consistency.",

        "section": "1.4. \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" means a purchase.",
        "explanation": "This definition is structurally flawed because it lacks any specific meaning or clarification. It simply states that 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase' means 'a purchase,' which is redundant and does not provide any useful information for interpreting the agreement. This lack of a clear definition can lead to misunderstandings regarding the scope and applicability of the agreement's terms.",

        "section": "2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an internal inconsistency regarding the hierarchy of documents. It states that the Agreement prevails over the Quote and Purchase Order unless the Quote or Purchase Order is signed by specific high-level executives and explicitly states its intent to supersede the Agreement. This creates ambiguity because it's not clear under what specific circumstances a Quote or Purchase Order could actually supersede the main Agreement, potentially leading to disputes over which terms govern.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "There is ambiguity in this section. If the delivery deadline is not met, there is no guidance given on liability for who must pay the expedited shipping costs. There should be a clause saying who must pay the shipping cost to clear up confusion.",

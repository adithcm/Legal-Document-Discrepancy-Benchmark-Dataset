        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. Once approved, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently implement their respective obligations under the SOW.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction regarding the obligations once the SOW is approved. The text says they need to diligently implement the approved SOW, but it does not include what happens if one party does not fulfill the SOW. This text should specify repercussions if the SOW is not followed through on.",

In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This creates an inconsistency. The first sentence requires a party wishing to renew the agreement to give notice. The second sentence provides that if no notice is given, the agreement is automatically renewed. Thus, notice is not necessary.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party\" is structurally flawed and unclear. It is not explained what that means. This lack of explanation makes the indemnity obligation vague and hard to determine.",

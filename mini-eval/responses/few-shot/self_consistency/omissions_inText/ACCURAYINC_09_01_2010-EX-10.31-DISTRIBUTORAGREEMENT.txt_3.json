        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "This appointment is explicitly non-exclusive and worldwide, yet it's limited to 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases.' This creates ambiguity. If Siemens sells a single LINAC product, it is unclear if this agreement still applies, leading to an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section requires Siemens to ensure its affiliates adhere to the agreement, EXCEPT if they already have a distribution agreement with Accuray. This creates a potential contradiction. If an affiliate has a pre-existing agreement, it is unclear which agreement governs. This could lead to conflicting obligations and enforcement issues.",

        "section": "Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This clause presents an inconsistency related to the responsibility for expedited shipping costs. It stipulates that Accuray is responsible if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the order submission. However, it lacks clarity on what happens if the delay is caused by Accuray's internal processes or unforeseen issues within Accuray's control, potentially creating ambiguity on the allocation of these costs.",

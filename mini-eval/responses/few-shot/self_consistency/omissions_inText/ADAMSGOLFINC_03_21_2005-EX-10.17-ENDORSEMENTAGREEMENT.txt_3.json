If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines a repayment schedule if Watson doesn't meet the minimum number of tournaments. However, it only specifies the repayment amount per event for each year, and it does not specify what satisfactory record of play is. This omission leads to potential disputes as 'satisfactory record of play' is a subjective term that can be interpreted differently by both parties, especially if Watson participates in an event but performs poorly.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This creates a legal contradiction in that the agreement forces the consultant's estate to repay ADAMS GOLF for payments already made and for services already rendered, despite Watson being unable to continue with the agreement due to his death. This is contradictory to the provision that upon the consultant's death the contract is simply terminated with no claw-back. Depending on the jurisdiction, claw-back provisions that attempt to recoup payments already made for services that were adequately performed may be considered unreasonable or unenforceable, especially in scenarios involving death or disability where the inability to perform is not due to the consultant's fault.",

        "explanation": "This section describes how to select arbitrators, yet fails to outline the process for finding a third arbitrator if the two arbitrators chosen are unable to agree upon a third arbitrator. It does not explain how the third arbitrator will be selected. This omission would cause issues when trying to find the third arbitrator",

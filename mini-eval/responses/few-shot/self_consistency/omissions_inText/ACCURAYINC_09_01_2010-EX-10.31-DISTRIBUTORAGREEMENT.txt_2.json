Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency. It states the distributor can cancel the purchase order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt, but it does not include a clause for Accurays cancellation if they do not find the purchase order in line with what they are expecting.",

A wire transfer made in advance of the date payment is due, made in U.S. dollars, to a bank selected by Accuray, according to the following schedule:\n5.4.1.2.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and\n5.4.1.2.2. The remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.",
        "explanation": "The terms are misaligned with Section 4.1.2, which states that Accuray will bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. This section does not state whether the wire transfer should also include these costs, this should be defined.",

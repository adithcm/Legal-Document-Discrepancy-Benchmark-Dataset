        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section on shipment terms contains an ambiguity. It states that Accuray will bear expedited shipping costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission. However, the language is ambiguous because the 6 month lead time is only applicable if Accuray is responsible for the delay, it is not clear how shipping costs would be allocated if the Customer requires expedited delivery.",

        "explanation": "The language 'including but not limited to pending Quotes' creates an ambiguity because quotes are not obligations but rather offers. It is unclear whether Accuray is obligated to honor quotes after termination or expiration, potentially causing disputes over pricing and commitments.",

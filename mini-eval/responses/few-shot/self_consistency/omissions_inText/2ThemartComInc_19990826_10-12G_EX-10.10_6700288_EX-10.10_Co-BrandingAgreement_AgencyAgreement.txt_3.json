        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the termination rights if the Launch Date is not achieved within 4 months of the Effective Date. The discrepancy lies in the condition that termination is only allowed by the party who used 'good faith and reasonable development efforts.' This creates an ambiguity regarding how 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' are defined and measured. It opens the door for disputes about whether a party genuinely made sufficient efforts, complicating the termination process and potentially leading to litigation. There is no clear metric to evaluate this, making the clause subject to subjective interpretation.",

This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions ('the Adjusted Rate'), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section details that the 'per Transaction Inquiry amount' may be revised, or 'adjusted' from time to time by mutual consent. However, it fails to specify a default rate or the initial 'per Transaction Inquiry amount' prior to any adjustments. This omission is a significant oversight. Without a defined initial rate, the entire payment scheme lacks a starting point and becomes unenforceable. It's effectively an agreement to agree, which is often not legally binding. This creates an in-text contradiction because it implies a functioning payment system while lacking a fundamental element.",

Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a 'force majeure event'), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "The force majeure clause has a structural flaw that creates an ambiguity. The text states that a party is excused from performance due to a force majeure event. It then allows termination without penalty if the force majeure event lasts 60 days or more. However, it then states that force majeure does not limit obligations under Section 9, which is the Indemnity clause. This means that even if a force majeure event prevents a party from fulfilling its obligations and the agreement is terminated because of it, the indemnity obligations in Section 9 still apply. This creates an imbalance and potentially unfair outcome where a party, unable to perform due to circumstances beyond their control, remains liable for indemnification claims related to that non-performance. The interplay between excused performance, termination rights, and ongoing indemnity obligations is structurally unclear.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This clause lacks specificity, leaving open the possibility of disputes. It does not state how capital needs are determined, how contributions are decided upon, or what happens if a joint venturer is unable or unwilling to contribute. This ambiguity could lead to disagreements and undermine the stability of the venture.",

Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986...to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code...",
        "explanation": "While the agreement explicitly states the intention to avoid partnership status for tax purposes and elects out of Subchapter K, the operational aspects of the agreement (such as shared control, profit/loss distribution, and mutual agency) may still be interpreted as creating a partnership under state law. This creates a legal contradiction as the stated intention may not align with the practical reality of the arrangement.",

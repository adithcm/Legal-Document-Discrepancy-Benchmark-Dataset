        "explanation": "The contract states it begins September 1, 2004, but is entered into on January 13, 2005. This means that the contract is being signed four months after it supposedly started. This creates ambiguity, especially regarding obligations and compensation for that initial period. This discrepancy needs clarification.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This termination clause, linked with the repayment clause in 8A creates a contradiction. If Watson dies or is permanently unable to play, requiring his estate to repay Adams Golf for the 'unperformed' portion is harsh and potentially unconscionable. Death/permanent disability is fundamentally different from a voluntary breach or failure to meet the minimum events; thus, the repayment requirement seems inappropriately punitive in such circumstances. This raises questions about fairness and enforceability, given that the event triggering the repayment is outside Watson's control. There also is no specification as to what 'unable to play tour golf at all' means, what would the parameters be to define such an event.",

        "section": "In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "The arbitration clause is structurally flawed. It states that if the parties cannot agree on the panel, each party picks an arbitrator, and then those two arbitrators select the third. However, it does not say how the first two arbitrators are chosen. The two parties need to agree on how the other two arbitrators are picked. Therefore, this makes the language structurally flawed as this step is crucial for forming a neutral panel, thus making this section confusing.",

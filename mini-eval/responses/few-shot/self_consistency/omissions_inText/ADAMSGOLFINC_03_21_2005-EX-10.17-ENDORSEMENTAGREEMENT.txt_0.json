        "section": "TERM OF CONTRACT The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract term is not clearly defined due to redactions. The lack of specified years and months creates ambiguity, making it impossible to determine the actual duration and end date of the agreement. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes over the contract's validity period.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This creates a contradiction with standard legal principles. Upon death or total disability, requiring repayment for unperformed services is unusual and potentially unconscionable. It would be difficult to enforce, especially given the nature of the services and the circumstances leading to non-performance. The amount of repayment must be more specific.",

        "section": "In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "While stating that the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, it does not specify which version of the rules will be applicable. The rules are periodically updated, and the absence of a version number creates ambiguity and potential for disputes.",

        "explanation": "The definition provided for 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase' is circular and lacks substantive meaning, as it simply equates the term to 'a purchase.' This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine the specific types of transactions to which the agreement applies.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The clause regarding expedited delivery costs contains an inconsistency. It states that Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, using June 1 and December 1 as an example. However, if the requested delivery date was October 1 in the second example (four months), any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'reasonably undisputed invoice' introduces ambiguity. It is unclear what constitutes a 'reasonably undisputed' invoice, potentially leading to disputes over invoice validity and payment deadlines.",

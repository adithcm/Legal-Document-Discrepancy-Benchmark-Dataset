        "explanation": "In Section 1 Definitions, definition 1.4 states: 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase' means a purchase. This is a structural flaw that does not make sense, because the defined term is equal to the meaning, thus it does not provide any details. There is no context or information provided to explain what 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase' means.",

Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer. <*$p$*>4.6.

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray. \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable. In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray.

        "explanation": "Section 4.5 states that Accuray may require Distributor to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray, in order to obtain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record. However, this is only with the consent of Distributor. The term 'consent' is ambigious in legal terms, because it does not define any procedure for consent to be determined.",

Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent. 10.2. Products Liability Indemnity.

There is a structural flaw with how this sentence is written. It should state the type of action, to make a distinction.",

        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination if an SOW isn't agreed upon within 2 months. However, Section 2.3 allows termination if the Launch Date (dependent on the SOW) hasn't occurred within 4 months. This creates a discrepancy as it's unclear if failing to agree on the SOW and then missing the Launch Date deadline allows for two separate termination events or if they are linked.",

        "explanation": "The language 'means including, but not limited to' in the context of promoting 'to every seller and high bidder' creates ambiguity. While it suggests broad promotion, it doesn't definitively mandate that every single seller and high bidder receives the promotion, making it potentially unenforceable if 2TheMart misses some users.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' is vague and could drastically limit the scope of indemnification. It's unclear what 'deemed a principal' means legally, potentially creating a loophole where indemnification is avoided even for clear acts of negligence.",

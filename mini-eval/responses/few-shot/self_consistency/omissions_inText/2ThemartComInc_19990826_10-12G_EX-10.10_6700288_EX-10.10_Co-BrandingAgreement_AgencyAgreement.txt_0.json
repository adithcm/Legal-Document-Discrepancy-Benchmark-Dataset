        "section": "The parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the initial operation of the Information Transfer Mechanism and to describe such operation and development fees, in a statement of work (\"SOW\"). Each party shall make available sufficient and qualified engineers to negotiate the SOW. No SOW shall be binding on the parties unless mutually approved by both parties. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the process for creating a Statement of Work (SOW) but states that if an SOW isn't agreed upon within 2 months, either party can terminate the agreement. However, Section 2.3 later states that if the Launch Date hasn't occurred within 4 months of the Effective Date due to a lack of good faith and reasonable efforts, either party can terminate. It is ambiguous as to what would happen if both conditions were satisfied for either party.",

This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the advertising fees are based on Transaction Inquiries, and the rate can be adjusted by mutual consent. It omits the initial agreed-upon rate. The lack of a clearly defined initial rate creates ambiguity, as there's no baseline for calculating payments until an adjustment is made.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' is unclear and may limit the scope of indemnification. The legal standard for when an indemnified party would be considered a principal of the indemnifying party is not defined, leading to uncertainty.",

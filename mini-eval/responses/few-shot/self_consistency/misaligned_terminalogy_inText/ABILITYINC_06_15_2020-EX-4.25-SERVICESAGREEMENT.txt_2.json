        "explanation": "The agreement states it is 'entered into' on October 1, 2019, but then states it is 'made effective' on November 1, 2019. This is a discrepancy because it is not clear what obligations, if any, exist between October 1 and November 1. What happens in that month if there is an issue?",

        "explanation": "This clause is ambiguous. While it requires 'good faith negotiations' for the price of additional services, it does not specify what happens if the parties cannot agree on a price. This could lead to disputes over whether Provider is obligated to provide the services without a mutually agreed-upon price.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a structural flaw and does not make sense. It says 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020'. The use of the word 'Agreement' twice and the phrase 'be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' are confusing and seem to be structurally flawed.",

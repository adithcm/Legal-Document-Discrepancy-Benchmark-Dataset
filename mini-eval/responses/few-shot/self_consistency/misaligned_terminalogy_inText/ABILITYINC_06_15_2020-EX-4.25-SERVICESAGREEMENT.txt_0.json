Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section requires Provider Representatives to be dedicated solely to Recipient and not provide services to Provider's other customers. However, Section 1.1(a) allows for additional services 'at a price to be agreed upon.' This raises ambiguity: if those additional services require Provider Representatives to work beyond their capacity dedicated to Recipient, it creates a contradiction.",

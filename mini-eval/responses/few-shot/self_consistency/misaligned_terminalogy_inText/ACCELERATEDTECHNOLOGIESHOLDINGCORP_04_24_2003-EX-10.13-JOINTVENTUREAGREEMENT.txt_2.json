        "section": "Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. (\"CCGI\") and Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. (\"PVSS\"), (the \"Parties\" or \"Joint Venturers\" if referred to collectively, or the \"Entity\" if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\"), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "While stating the agreement is for a 'joint venture', it explicitly clarifies that they are acting as 'business associates' and 'not as partners'. Then it states the agreement is 'in the formation of a joint venture'. The contradiction lies in disavowing a partnership while simultaneously forming a joint venture, especially since joint ventures are often legally considered partnerships. This creates ambiguity as to the intended legal structure and liabilities of the entity formed.",

        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement is a contradiction because joint ventures typically involve a capital contribution from both parties. Stating that no capital contribution is required unless mutually agreed upon undermines the very nature of a joint venture, where each party brings resources to the table. This lack of clarity on initial investment causes ambiguity and contradiction because it is not clear how the joint venture will gain capital.",

        "explanation": "The term 'Founders' is not defined anywhere in the agreement. While it can be inferred that it refers to CCGI and PVSS, using an undefined term creates ambiguity, especially since the agreement already clearly defines them as 'Joint Venturers.' This misalignment leads to potential confusion about responsibilities.",

        "section": "TERM OF CONTRACT The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract's term is not clearly defined due to redactions. The length in years and months is obscured, as is the termination date. This ambiguity makes it impossible to determine the precise duration of the agreement, which could lead to disputes over the term's validity and the parties' obligations.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination due to the consultant's death or inability to play golf and stipulates repayment for the unperformed period, calculated as per paragraph 8A. Section 23 also requires repayment upon termination for cause by either party using the same calculation in 8A. This leads to an inconsistency since repayment is unusual in situations of termination for cause by the consultant",

        "section": "In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "The text states that arbitration venue is Kansas, but section 25 states that the applicable law is that of Kansas. This creates an ambiguity about whether Kansas law will govern procedural issues related to arbitration or just substantive contract interpretation. Many jurisdictions have specific arbitration laws which are applicable regardless of the substantive law governing the contract.",

        "section": "This Services Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is entered into on October 1, 2019 and is made effective as of November 1, 2019 (the \"Effective Date\")",
        "explanation": "This section defines the agreement's effective date as November 1, 2019, which is relevant for determining when certain obligations begin. However, Section 3.1 states that the agreement terminates on December 31, 2020. This creates a short agreement duration of approximately 14 months. Though not a direct contradiction, this raises concerns about the practicality and business sense of having a detailed services agreement for such a brief period. This could influence how terms like 'historical provision of services' are interpreted, as the historical period is limited.",

        "section": "As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "This section states the compensation is based on 'Provider's actual cost' plus a 10% service fee. However, 'actual cost' is not clearly defined. It doesn't specify what cost items are allowable or how they will be verified. Without a clear definition of 'actual cost,' the Recipient is exposed to potential disputes over inflated or unverified cost submissions, which could create ambiguity in payment obligations.",

        "section": "Any Party (the \"Non-Breaching Party\") may terminate this Agreement with respect to any Service, in whole but not in part, at any time upon prior written notice to the other Party (the \"Breaching Party\"), if the Breaching Party has failed (other than pursuant to Section 3.6) to perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement relating to such Service, and such failure shall have continued without cure for a period of 30 days after receipt by the Breaching Party of a written notice of such failure from the Non-Breaching Party seeking to terminate such service.",
        "explanation": "Section 3.3 allows termination for breach if the breach continues uncured for 30 days after notice. However, Section 3.2 allows termination without cause with 90 days' notice. This creates a potential contradiction because a party could avoid the requirements and potential liabilities associated with a breach termination simply by invoking the termination without cause clause. This undermines the purpose of the breach termination clause and creates uncertainty about which termination rights take precedence.",

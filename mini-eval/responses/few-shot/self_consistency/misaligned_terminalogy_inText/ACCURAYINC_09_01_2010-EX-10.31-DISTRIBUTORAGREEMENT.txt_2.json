        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi- Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "The terminology is misaligned because the agreement mentions 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases' several times without providing a clear and distinct definition that separates the two. While sections 1.5 and 1.6 attempt definitions, the lack of clear differentiation when the term is used in practice creates potential for confusion and disagreement on which specific conditions apply.",

        "explanation": "This section contains ambiguity in text. The conditions under which a Quote or Purchase Order can supersede the agreement are unclear. Requiring signatures from specific high-level executives and an explicit reference to this section adds complexity. However, the language does not explicitly forbid other sections from being superseded, leading to potential disputes over the extent of the supersession.",

        "explanation": "Ambiguity exists in the text as the start of the warranty period is unclearly defined. There are two events that could start the warranty, the install date and the shipment date. The ambiguity exists because it is not fully clear under what conditions the warranty is valid, which creates uncertainty about the exact duration and start of the warranty.",

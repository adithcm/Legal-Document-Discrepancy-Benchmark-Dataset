        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "While the agreement states a 'worldwide' distribution, Section 4.4 indicates that Accuray may require the Distributor to enter into a separate distribution agreement under certain conditions (no direct presence or distributor in the Customer's country). This creates ambiguity: is the distribution truly worldwide, or limited by Accuray's presence in specific countries?",

        "explanation": "This clause introduces a potential contradiction. While there are no minimum purchase requirements, Distributor is required to agree to annual sales targets in the Strategic Alliance Agreement. It is unclear what happens if Distributor fails to meet these sales targets. Does this constitute a breach, even without minimum purchase obligations? This creates ambiguity regarding the consequences of not achieving the stated sales targets.",

        "section": "Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that Accuray will indemnify for patent infringements in the US, Germany, or the country where the customer requested delivery. However, section 10.4 outlines indemnity exclusions. If the infringement occurred due to exclusions like using the product contrary to Accuray's specifications, the indemnity does not apply. This creates an ambiguity. The term does not make clear if the exclusions also apply in the US, Germany or the customer's country.",

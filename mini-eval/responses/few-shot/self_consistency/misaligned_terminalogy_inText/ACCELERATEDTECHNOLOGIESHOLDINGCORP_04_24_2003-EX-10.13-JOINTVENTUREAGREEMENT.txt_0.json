(\"PVSS\"), (the \"Parties\" or \"Joint Venturers\" if referred to collectively, or the \"Entity\" if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\"), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The text states that the parties are forming a joint venture, but also specifies they are 'business associates, and not as partners'. While a joint venture is a type of business association, explicitly disclaiming a 'partnership' creates ambiguity. A joint venture is, in many legal contexts, considered a partnership, so this statement is contradictory and could cause confusion about liability and obligations.",

The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Participant shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Investor shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of this section states that the Associates shall have 'full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture'. However, the paragraph goes on to limit this authority by stating that certain actions require written consent of both parties. This creates an internal contradiction as to the scope of each party's authority.",

The Founders shall maintain adequate books and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All direct costs and expenses, which shall include any insurance costs in connection with the distribution of the Goods or operations of the Partnership, or if the business of the Syndicate requires additional office facilities than those now presently maintained by each Owner, such item shall be paid by the Joint Venture. The fiscal year of the Joint Venture shall be the calendar year, and shall use the cash basis of accounting. If requested by a Stockholder, the Joint Venture books and records shall be audited as of the close of each year by an independent accountant acceptable to both Joint Venturers. All books and records of every kind and character, of the Joint Venture, and other information, shall be kept at the principal office of the Joint Venture, or at such other place or places as may be agreed upon by the Joint Venturers, and shall be fully available to each Joint Venturer or his duly authorized representative, all at reasonable times. The books of the Joint Venture shall represent the complete record and report of business operations, including a balance sheet and income and expense statements reflecting all receipts and disbursements of the Joint Venture, and such reports shall be submitted to the Joint Venturers on a regular basis.",

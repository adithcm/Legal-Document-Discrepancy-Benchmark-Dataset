        "explanation": "The statement says that the parties associate themselves as business associates and NOT as partners, however the agreement then says 'in the formation of a joint venture'. Joint ventures are in fact partnerships which causes a contradiction.",

Neither Participant shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Investor shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "The clause says neither participant shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but then it proceeds to mention that each investor shall be reimbursed for direct expenses. This can be interpreted as a form of compensation. It causes an in-text contradiction, in which can be confusing.",

Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to opt out of partnership treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. However, the characterization of the entity under state law may be different. This section also could cause a contradiction. If the joint venture is deemed a partnership under Pennsylvania law (reference Section 14), certain partnership rules would apply regardless of the intent to avoid federal partnership tax treatment.",

        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section allows for termination if an SOW isn't agreed upon within 2 months. However, Section 2.3 states that either party may terminate if the Launch Date hasn't occurred within 4 months. The term, 'Effective Date' causes ambiguity since the 'Effective Date' is defined as June 21, 1999 and the contract was signed June 11, 1999. If it is signed June 11, 1999, then why would the 'Effective Date' be June 21, 1999? There is no proper definition of what 'Effective Date' means. This discrepancy involves conflicting timelines for potential termination, which creates confusion.",

        "section": "Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "The third sentence says 'the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.' Section 9 is about indemnity. This means that even if a force majeure event occurs, the indemnifying party's obligation to indemnify the other party for third-party claims is not limited. This creates a contradiction, though, because it implies that the indemnity obligations survive even when performance is otherwise excused by force majeure. It removes any benefits given by a force majeure.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The third sentence says that a party wishing to renew must give notice 30 days before expiration, but the last sentence says the term is automatically renewed if no notice is given. These two sentences contradict each other.",

        "section": "CONTENT means all digital assets, regardless of medium, that either party provides to the other for use in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, text, audio files, visual recordings, images, datasets, or programs. Assets given by 2TheMart will be known as \"2TheMart Material,\" while assets given by i-Escrow are termed \"i-Escrow Media.\"",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"CONTENT\" includes all digital assets, which is very broad. However, the contract later imposes restrictions and standards on the *content* that each party can provide (Section 6.6), suggesting that not *all* content is acceptable, and also creates restrictions on who can access this content. This creates a contradiction as to how the term should be interpreted.",

        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The method of determining advertising fees is based on a calculation, but the term \"Customer Engagements\" is never defined. Without a clear definition, it is impossible to determine how advertising fees are calculated, which could lead to a dispute.",

Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "This indemnity clause contains contradictory language. The first sentence introduces a condition that the 'Protected Party' must be considered a 'key agent of the Guarantor' for the indemnity to apply, and 'Deliverables provided to Patrons' is not a defined term. This introduces ambiguity and contradiction within the section itself.",

        "section": "TERM OF CONTRACT The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract lacks a defined end date. The number of years and months are redacted. This is problematic because the duration of the agreement is undefined, which is vital for calculating obligations and determining when the contract expires. Since the ending date is not provided, there is no way to determine how long the contract is.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section says that if Watson dies, his estate is responsible for repaying ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed contract. This is inconsistent with basic contract law and fairness. Typically, contracts for personal services (like endorsement deals) are discharged by impossibility upon the death of the performing party. Enforcing a repayment obligation against the estate is unusual and potentially unconscionable, especially since Adams Golf can no longer benefit from Watson's services.",

Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the construction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though such section headings had been omitted.",
        "explanation": "While facially reasonable, this clause could create structural issues. Headings often provide crucial context and organizational structure to a contract. By stating that headings should be ignored during construction, the agreement introduces ambiguity. Courts often look to headings to understand the intention and organization of the agreement, ignoring these can cause interpretation issues.",

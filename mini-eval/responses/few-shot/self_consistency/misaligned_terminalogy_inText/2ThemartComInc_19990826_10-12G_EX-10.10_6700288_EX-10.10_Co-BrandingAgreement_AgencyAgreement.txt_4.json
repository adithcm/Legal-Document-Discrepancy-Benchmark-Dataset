        "section": "This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The language regarding renewal is contradictory. It initially states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement' before the term's conclusion, creating an expectation of active consent. However, the subsequent sentence introduces an automatic renewal if no notice is given, essentially negating the need for mutual agreement. This contradiction makes it unclear whether active consent is truly required for renewal or if passive inaction suffices, leading to potential disputes. Because it does not specify which of the two happens first, this makes the legal terms contradicting.",

        "section": "Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The wording of the first sentence, 'provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor,' creates ambiguity and seems to contradict the subsequent specific indemnification obligations. The general indemnification is limited by the 'key agent' condition, while the following sentences impose specific indemnification obligations (2TheMart indemnifying i-Escrow for 2TheMart Material, and i-Escrow indemnifying 2TheMart for i-Escrow Media) without that same condition. This creates uncertainty about whether the 'key agent' limitation applies to all indemnification obligations or only the general one outlined in the first sentence. This could lead to disputes over the scope of indemnification based on the 'key agent' status. The fact that it is vague and leads to multiple interpretations makes this a legal term.",

        "section": "Successful completion of a transaction involves exchange of merchandise with payment. The buyer has to be satisfied he/she received what they thought they were getting and the seller has to be sure he/she gets paid. i-Escrow holds payment from the buyer in trust until the seller sends the merchandise to the buyer. Once the buyer accepts the merchandise, i-Escrow forwards the payment to the seller by writing a check. A typical escrow transaction: When an auction ends, your end of auction email contains links to i-Escrow. Once you have signed up with i-Escrow you go through the following steps to complete your transaction. 1. Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the merchandise along with email address of the other party. 2. The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction. 3. Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means. 4. i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer. 5. The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment. 6. The buyer receives and accepts the merchandise. 7. i-Escrow sends the check to the seller.",
        "explanation": "The escrow services description is not written as if it is an agreement. It is written as a description of a service rather than a legal contract, making the structure improper.",

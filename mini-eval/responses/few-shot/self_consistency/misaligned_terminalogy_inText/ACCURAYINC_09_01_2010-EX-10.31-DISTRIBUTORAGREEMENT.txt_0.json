        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens. For the purposes of clarity within this document, a Partner is classified as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "This definition creates ambiguity. It defines 'Distributor' as Siemens, but then defines 'Partner' to include Siemens, its affiliates, or any third party granted distribution rights by Siemens. This implies that entities other than Siemens could act as distributors under this agreement, which contradicts the initial definition of 'Distributor.'",

        "section": "Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "This indemnification clause limits Accuray's liability to patent infringement claims in the US, Germany, or the Customer's country. However, the agreement establishes a 'worldwide' distributorship in Section 2.1. If a claim arises in another country, it's unclear whether Accuray would be responsible. This geographic limitation contradicts the scope of the distributorship and creates ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "There is an omission of terms. This section states that Accuray is responsible for installation 'unless otherwise agreed', which creates a lack of clarity on when distributor handles it themselves, it makes it hard to see when this happens and what the procedure is.",

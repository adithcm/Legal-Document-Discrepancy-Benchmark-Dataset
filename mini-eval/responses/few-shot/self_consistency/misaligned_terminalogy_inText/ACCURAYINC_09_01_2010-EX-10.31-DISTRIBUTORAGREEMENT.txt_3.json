        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi- Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "The term 'worldwide distributor' is too broad given the nature of Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases. It has not been made explicit that the distributor can only act as such when it comes to 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases'. If this is not specified, it can be interpreted as the distributor is also responsible for other general purchases. This can cause confusion when it comes to the scope of the contract.",

        "section": "2.2.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Distributor may present for approval to Accuray opportunities for sales of Products and Services at prices that differ from the prices set forth in the then current price list. Accuray may, in its sole and absolute discretion, approve any such opportunity, and if approved in writing by Accuray, Distributor shall otherwise be permitted to pursue such opportunity at such prices, which opportunity shall otherwise be governed by and pursued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "There is an ambiguity here regarding pricing. While 2.2.1 establishes that pricing should be based on Accuray's current price lists, section 2.2.2 allows the distributor to propose different prices for approval by Accuray. It's unclear what criteria Accuray uses to approve these deviations, making the pricing mechanism ambiguous and subject to Accuray's discretion without clear guidelines.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in how expedited shipping costs are handled. It states that Accuray covers these costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission. However, it is not clear on how these costs are handled if there is no delivery deadline. What is the expected handling of expenses if the delivery deadline is determined by external factors or shipment constraints?",

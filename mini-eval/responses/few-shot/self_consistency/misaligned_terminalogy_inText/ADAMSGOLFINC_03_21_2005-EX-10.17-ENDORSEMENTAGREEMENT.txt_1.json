        "section": "The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The redacted portions create ambiguity because the end date of the agreement is unclear. Without knowing the specific number of years and months, it's impossible to determine the agreement's duration. This could lead to disputes about when the contract ends and obligations cease.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. It states that if the consultant dies or is unable to play golf, ADAMS GOLF can terminate the contract and the consultant must repay for the unperformed period. This contradicts the general principle that death or inability to perform due to circumstances beyond one's control (like death) typically excuses performance without requiring repayment. It's unusual and potentially unenforceable to demand repayment from a deceased person's estate under these circumstances, especially considering the term 'unable to play tour golf at all' is not specifically defined.",

        "explanation": "This section is structurally flawed because it provides an address for giving notice to the CONSULTANT, but then includes the phrase 'or at such other address as is given in writing to ADAMS GOLF by CONSULTANT.' Logically, the consultant cannot give an address to Adams Golf, to then give notice to the consultant.",

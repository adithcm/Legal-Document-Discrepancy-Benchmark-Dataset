        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens. For the purposes of clarity within this document, a Partner is classified as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "This definition introduces ambiguity by defining 'Distributor' as Siemens, but then expanding 'Partner' to include Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party with distribution rights granted by Siemens. This creates confusion because 'Distributor' and 'Partner' could be used interchangeably, leading to uncertainty about which entity is bound by specific obligations in the agreement. It's unclear if all obligations assigned to the 'Distributor' also apply to 'Partners' or only to Siemens directly.",

        "section": "2.3.2. Quote. Following receipt of Distributor's Quote request, Accuray will determine whether to approve the issuance of a Quote related to such request. Such determination shall be made in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Schedule 2.3.2 attached hereto. If Accuray approves the issuance of a Quote, Accuray shall issue a Quote to Distributor based on the Product configuration and Services requested by the Customer, including pricing for such Products and Services as provided in Section 2.2 above. The Quote issued by Accuray in relation to a Customer opportunity shall serve as the basis of any offer made by Distributor to that Customer and shall remain valid for at least six months (unless earlier declined by Distributor), and Distributor shall submit an amended Quote request to Accuray in the event adjustments to a Quote are requested by the Customer. Any such amended Quote request from Distributor shall again be subject to the Accuray approval process set forth in this Section 2.3.2.",
        "explanation": "This Section outlines that Accuray has the right to approve or disapprove the issuance of a Quote based on Schedule 2.3.2, but then Section 3.5 (Offers) requires Distributor to offer Customers only those Products or Services described in then current price lists, and only in accordance with the applicable Customer Quote and this Agreement. This creates ambiguity. If Accuray can disapprove a Quote, is Distributor still obligated to offer based on current price lists if a specific configuration is not approved? This is an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "In this section there is ambiguity in text. In the first half, the text implies that Accuray will ship via FedEx ground with no extra insurance if no specific requests are made. Then, the section states the supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. There is no set time if there is a expedited deliver outside the 6 month mark. This is ambiguity in text because there are multiple ways to interpret the text.",

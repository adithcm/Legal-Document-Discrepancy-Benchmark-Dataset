        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "The initial SOW agreement is critical, but the clause only allows for termination if an agreement isn't reached in 2 months. This doesn't account for disputes that may arise *after* the SOW is initially agreed upon but need amendments later in the project, or if one party doesn't fulfill their duties as described in the SOW. This could lead to issues if one party stalls implementation after the initial SOW approval without violating the termination clause.",

        "section": "i-Escrow may place banner advertising on the Co-Branded Site upon prior written approval of 2TheMart, which shall be at the discretion of 2TheMart.",
        "explanation": "While 2TheMart has discretion over ad approval, the clause doesn't define standards or criteria. 2TheMart could arbitrarily deny ads, hindering i-Escrow's revenue. There is no specification of a reasonable time to respond or recourse if denials appear biased, which creates an ambiguous situation.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The term is automatically renewed for another year, however the statement contradicts itself. To renew, a written agreement is required by both parties before the conclusion of the agreement but it also states that if either party fails to send a notice that it is not renewed then it will automatically renew for another year. It should not automatically renew for another year if a written agreement is required.",

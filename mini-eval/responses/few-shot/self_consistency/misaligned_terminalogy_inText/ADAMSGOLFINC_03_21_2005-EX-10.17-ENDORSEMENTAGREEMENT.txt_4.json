        "section": "TERM OF CONTRACT The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract period's end date is not specified due to redactions, while the start date is, creating ambiguity about the agreement's exact duration. The lack of clarity regarding the termination date, while specifying a commencement date and a term of years and months, creates a contradiction, as a defined start and duration should lead to a specific end date. This omission complicates determining the agreement's validity or the remaining obligations of either party.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "The precise number of tournaments required for a 'satisfactory record of play' is redacted. Without this number, it's unclear what constitutes compliance with this requirement. Furthermore, the specific dollar amounts to be repaid per event not achieved are also redacted, rendering the financial penalty for non-compliance unenforceable. The lack of specific numbers leads to ambiguity in what constitutes satisfactory compliance and what the financial ramifications of non-compliance are, creating a contradictory situation where obligations and their associated penalties are undefined.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This termination clause mandates repayment by the CONSULTANT's estate if he is unable to play due to death, calculated as per Section 8A. However, Section 19C stipulates that in the event of ADAMS GOLF's insolvency or bankruptcy, the CONSULTANT is not obligated to repay any money as long as he continues to perform his obligations. While seemingly unrelated, Section 19C creates ambiguity when juxtaposed with Section 22; the situation is not clear if ADAMS GOLF declares insolvency before termination, whether the consultant/estate would have to pay back the money. This contradictory nature is an ambiguity in text.",

        "explanation": "The contract term is not clearly defined due to the redactions. It's impossible to determine the exact duration, creating ambiguity in the agreement. The missing start and end dates affect the enforceability of obligations, such as the consultant's exclusive endorsement and Adams Golf's payment responsibilities.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The minimum number of tournaments CONSULTANT must play is redacted, creating ambiguity and potential contradiction. Without a defined number, it's unclear how to trigger the repayment obligation and calculate the repayment amount per event. This creates a structural flaw as it relates to the consultants compensation based on performance and repayment based on failure to perform.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section requires CONSULTANT (or his estate) to repay ADAMS GOLF if he dies or becomes unable to play. However, Section 19.C states that CONSULTANT is not obligated to repay any money in the event of ADAMS GOLF'S insolvency or bankruptcy, so long as CONSULTANT continues to fully perform his obligations under this agreement. This creates conflicting obligations regarding repayment, depending on the reason for non-performance. If ADAMS GOLF goes bankrupt and Watson dies, it is unclear if repayment is required.",

        "section": "Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The term 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases' is a key term defining the scope of the distributorship. However, the definition of 'Multiple LINAC Purchase' (1.6) and 'Multi-Modality Purchase' (1.5) both require at least one 'Distributor' product. Since Accuray is not a distributor, it creates a contradiction. If Accuray directly sells its own products, it is not clear whether it has to sell one of Siemens's products.",

        "explanation": "This section provides indemnification for products that are unsafe when used according to Accuray's specifications. However, Section 4.6 (Warranty) disclaims all warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This creates a conflict: Accuray indemnifies against unsafe products used as specified, but disclaims warranties that the products are suitable for that use.",

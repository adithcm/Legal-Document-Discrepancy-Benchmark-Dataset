        "section": "This Services Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is entered into on October 1, 2019 and is made effective as of November 1, 2019 (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between [ * * * ] (the \"Provider\"), and TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD., a company organized and existing under the laws of Singapore and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel (each and both of them \"Recipient\").",
        "explanation": "There is an issue with the definition of \"Recipient\". The agreement lists TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd. as recipients, implying they are jointly the 'Recipient'. However, the grammar throughout the document treats 'Recipient' as a singular entity (e.g., 'Recipient wishes to engage', 'Recipient shall own'). If two distinct companies are intended to act jointly as the Recipient, this should be clarified and their respective rights and obligations clearly delineated.",

        "explanation": "The text contains a structural flaw. The phrase 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' is grammatically incorrect and unclear. It should read something like 'This Agreement shall be deemed effective as of the Effective Date' or 'This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date.' The added word 'Agreement' is unnecessary and creates confusion.",

        "explanation": "While a forum selection clause is typical, it is unclear if \"country\" refers only to the physical location where the breach occurred or if it encompasses any jurisdiction where the provider has a presence. This lack of specificity could create disputes about where an injunction can be sought, particularly if the provider's breach affects multiple countries.",

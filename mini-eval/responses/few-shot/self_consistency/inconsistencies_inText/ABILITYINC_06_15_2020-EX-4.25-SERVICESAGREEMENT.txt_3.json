        "explanation": "The agreement lists TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd. as 'Recipient' but describes TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD as being located in Tel Aviv, Israel, while also describing it as a company organized and existing under the laws of Singapore. This creates a contradiction in the location and governing laws applicable to TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' is structurally flawed. It repeats 'Agreement' unnecessarily and creates confusion as to what is meant. The sentence structure does not make sense, and the grammar is incorrect.",

        "explanation": "The governing law clause specifies that Israeli law governs but excludes any conflict of law rules that would lead to the application of non-Israeli law. However, the exclusion applies to conflict of law rules 'whether of the State of Israel or any other jurisdiction'. This is confusing because conflict of law principles are designed to determine which jurisdiction's laws apply. By excluding any such rules that would cause the application of laws other than the State of Israel, the clause is contradictory, as it attempts to both apply Israeli law and negate the purpose of conflict of law principles, causing confusion as to whether conflict of law principles are meant to be followed.",

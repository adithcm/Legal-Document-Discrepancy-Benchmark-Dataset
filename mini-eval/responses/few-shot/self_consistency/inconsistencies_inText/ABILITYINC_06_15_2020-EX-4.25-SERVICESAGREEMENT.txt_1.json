        "section": "This Services Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is entered into on October 1, 2019 and is made effective as of November 1, 2019 (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between [ * * * ] (the \"Provider\"), and TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD., a company organized and existing under the laws of Singapore and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel (each and both of them \"Recipient\").",
        "explanation": "The agreement defines TELCOSTAR PTE. LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd. together as \"Recipient\". This could create confusion because these are two distinct legal entities, and actions or notices may need to be directed to one or both. Combining them under a single term without specifying how they act jointly or separately may lead to ambiguity in obligations and rights.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' is structurally flawed and grammatically incorrect. It is unclear what the second \"Agreement\" is referring to, creating confusion about the effective period.",

        "explanation": "The clause specifies that Israeli law governs the agreement but excludes any conflict of law provisions that would cause the application of other laws. This exclusion could potentially negate established conflict of law principles, leading to unintended and potentially unfavorable legal outcomes if a dispute involves international elements where conflict of laws is typically considered.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Joint Venturers are not entitled to compensation for services but will be reimbursed for direct expenses. However, Section 9 states that PVSS will receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability. This guaranteed payment could be interpreted as compensation for services, contradicting the provision in Section 5.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the procedure for asset distribution upon termination, stating that if the parties cannot agree on asset valuation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. has the final say. This lacks fairness and could lead to disputes, particularly if CCGI undervalues assets to the detriment of Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc.'s share. This creates ambiguity around the fairness of asset valuation and whether the distribution truly reflects prorata interests, as PVSS would not have any say on the final valuation.",

However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "This sets a specific term (March 1, 2003, to February 28, 2004) with a renewal clause, but also allows either party to unilaterally terminate with 60 days' notice. The lack of clarity regarding when a notice must be given in relation to the expiration date can cause issues. If a 60-day termination notice is provided, will that cancel the possibility of renewal?",

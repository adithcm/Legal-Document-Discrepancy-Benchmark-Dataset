        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the rate without i-Escrow's consent creates an imbalance. While the rate is initially defined, the power to revise it 'from time to time' and make it effective 'immediately' gives 2TheMart excessive control over a key financial term, potentially leading to disputes and a lack of predictability for i-Escrow's financial obligations. This also raises concerns about whether such a clause would be considered unconscionable or lacking in good faith under California law, which governs the agreement per Section 12.1.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This clause contains an inconsistency. It states that the agreement is renewed upon 'mutual written agreement' but then goes on to say that 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' If the agreement is automatically renewed, there is no mutual agreement needed, which is contradictory to the first sentence. It is not clear whether a renewal is automatic or needs to be mutually agreed upon.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This creates an internal logical contradiction. It first states that certain sections (including 8.5 itself) 'shall not survive expiration or termination.' Then it says that 'all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination.' This effectively means that Section 8.5, and any other section needed to enforce completion of pending customer transactions, *does* survive, creating a contradiction with the initial statement that it does not.",

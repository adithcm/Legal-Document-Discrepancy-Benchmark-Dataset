        "explanation": "While the distributor is appointed as a non-exclusive distributor worldwide, the appointment is limited only to instances of Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases. It does not allow the distributor to sell the Products and Services individually.",

        "explanation": "This section is a structural flaw. The sentence uses the number 2 in the middle of the sentence, and it is unclear what is being referred to. It is more than likely supposed to say 'Quotes issued'.",

        "explanation": "This contradicts Section 4.1.2. Section 4.1.2 mentions that 'Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor.' This implies that the shipment date could be less than six months, whereas Section 3.6 states it must be at least six months prior. This contradiction creates confusion about the actual required lead time for purchase orders.",

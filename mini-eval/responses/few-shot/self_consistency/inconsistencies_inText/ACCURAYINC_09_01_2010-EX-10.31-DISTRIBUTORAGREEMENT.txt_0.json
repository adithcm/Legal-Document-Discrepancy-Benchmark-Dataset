        "section": "2.3.2. Quote. Following receipt of Distributor's Quote request, Accuray will determine whether to approve the issuance of a Quote related to such request. Such determination shall be made in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Schedule 2.3.2 attached hereto. If Accuray approves the issuance of a Quote, Accuray shall issue a Quote to Distributor based on the Product configuration and Services requested by the Customer, including pricing for such Products and Services as provided in Section 2.2 above. The Quote issued by Accuray in relation to a Customer opportunity shall serve as the basis of any offer made by Distributor to that Customer and shall remain valid for at least six months (unless earlier declined by Distributor), and Distributor shall submit an amended Quote request to Accuray in the event adjustments to a Quote are requested by the Customer. Any such amended Quote request from Distributor shall again be subject to the Accuray approval process set forth in this Section 2.3.2.",
        "explanation": "This section states that a Quote issued by Accuray will remain valid for at least six months. However, Section 2.2.1 states that price lists are subject to change from time to time in Accuray's sole discretion. This creates a contradiction because Accuray could change the price list, effectively making the existing Quote invalid before the six-month period has expired. It is inconsistent in text.",

For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section requires the Distributor to send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. However, section 4.1.2 states that 'Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor.' This creates an in-text inconsistency of text.",

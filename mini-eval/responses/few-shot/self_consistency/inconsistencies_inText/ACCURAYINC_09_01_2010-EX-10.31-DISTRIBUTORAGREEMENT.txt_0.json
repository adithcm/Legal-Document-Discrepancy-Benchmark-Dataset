        "section": "Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This appointment appears non-exclusive, but then limits the distribution to only Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases. If Accuray appoints other distributors without this limitation, it creates ambiguity whether Siemens can compete for single-unit sales, creating a poorly defined scope.",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance.",
        "explanation": "The text allows the distributor to choose the freight carrier but Accuray makes the final decision if it is feasible. The text does not describe the scenario of what would occur if they can't agree on a freight carrier which could lead to a dispute.",

        "explanation": "Siemens needs to have their Affiliates bound to this agreement when purchasing systems or services, but there is a contradiction if the Affiliate is already part of a distribution agreement with Accuray. It would seem to imply that the previous agreement is replaced, but that is not mentioned in the text.",

        "section": "TERM OF CONTRACT The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract states that the term is for a period of years and months, but the specific end date is redacted. This creates an in-text contradiction. Without a clear end date, it's impossible to determine the exact duration of the agreement, leading to potential disputes over its validity and obligations.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "Paragraph 4 provides a general restriction on endorsements, yet 4D immediately provides an exception allowing endorsement of [*****]. The detailed conditions attached to the [*****] endorsement (consistent with past advertising practice, not placing a [*****] logo on Adams Golf product, etc.) create ambiguity. The lack of clear, objective criteria for 'consistent with past advertising practice' leaves room for dispute. The vague guidelines can lead to disagreement and possible litigation on what constitutes compliance.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination due to inability to play golf and dictates repayment to Adams Golf for the period not performed. The sentence prior, however, states that '...should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required.' It then continues to dictate the repayment schedule as it would normally happen under the agreement, regardless of the statement that no repayment shall be required. This causes a contradiction and ambiguity in the event of termination due to injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event.",

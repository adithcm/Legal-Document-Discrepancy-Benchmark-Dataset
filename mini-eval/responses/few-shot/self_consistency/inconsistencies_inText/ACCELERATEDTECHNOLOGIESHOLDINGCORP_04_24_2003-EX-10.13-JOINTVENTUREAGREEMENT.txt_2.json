        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "The clause regarding distributions contains a contradiction. It states that distributions can only be made if assets exceed liabilities and are distributed proportionally according to Section 6 (50/50 split). However, it then immediately states that PVSS is entitled to a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month 'regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.' This contradicts the earlier statement because a guaranteed payment suggests PVSS receives this amount even if liabilities exceed assets or it cuts into CCGI's 50% portion.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that upon termination and liquidation, if there's a dispute about asset valuation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. has the 'final say' on the asset's value. This is a structural flaw and is problematic because it gives CCGI unilateral authority over a critical aspect of the liquidation process. It inherently creates an imbalance of power, potentially allowing CCGI to undervalue assets to the detriment of PVSS. This undermines the principle of equitable distribution intended by the pro-rata ownership outlined in Section 6 and the overall purpose of a joint venture, which is ostensibly based on mutual benefit and shared control.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers agree and declare that this association for the carrying on of a joint venture business operation does not, and is not intended to create a partnership, for either legal or United States income tax purposes, each Party recognizing that the other is willing and able to contribute capital, labor, and services for the operation of a successful joint venture business. Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation. The Parties also declare that they are not making any agreement to undertake any business other than that set forth in this Agreement; and nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation of the powers or rights of either Party to carry on his separate business for his sole benefit; provided, however, the Parties shall cooperate with each other according to the terms and spirit of this Agreement in the performance of their joint venture business operation.",
        "explanation": "There is an ambiguity with conflicting obligations. The section says the agreement is not intended to create a partnership and the parties are electing out of partnership tax treatment. But then it says the parties will cooperate with each other according to the terms and spirit of the agreement in the performance of their joint venture. This cooperation, mandated by the contract, could be interpreted as actions consistent with a partnership, creating ambiguity.",

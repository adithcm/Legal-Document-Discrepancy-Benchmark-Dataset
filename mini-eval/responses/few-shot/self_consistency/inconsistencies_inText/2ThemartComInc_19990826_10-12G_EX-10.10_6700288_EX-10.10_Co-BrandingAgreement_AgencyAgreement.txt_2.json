        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fee without i-Escrow's consent creates a significant imbalance. While the agreement states the adjusted rate will reflect 'present market conditions,' this is a vague standard. The absence of objective criteria or a mechanism for i-Escrow to challenge adjustments could lead to disputes and unfair fees, essentially giving 2TheMart unchecked power over a crucial financial term of the agreement.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The automatic renewal clause creates ambiguity and potential contradiction. The agreement states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement,' but then adds that the term automatically renews if neither party gives notice of non-renewal. This contradicts the requirement for mutual agreement, suggesting the agreement can be extended without explicit consent. This creates uncertainty and could lead to disputes if one party believes the agreement should not have been renewed.",

Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This clause contains an in-text contradiction. The first part states that a party is excused from performance due to a force majeure event. However, the clause then stipulates that the occurrence of a force majeure event does not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification). This creates a contradiction because, in theory, if a force majeure event causes a party to act in a way that triggers indemnification, it's unclear if they are still liable, given the excuse from performance also granted by the force majeure clause.",

        "explanation": "The contract term is not clearly defined due to redactions. The lack of specific dates makes it impossible to determine the exact duration of the agreement, which creates ambiguity. Because it is unknown when the contract ends there are inconsistencies on how to enforce the legal obligations within the contract.",

        "explanation": "Due to redactions, this section's meaning is unclear and creates an inconsistency. It is not clear what type of ads the consultant doesn't have to wear Adams Golf gear in. This unclear clause creates ambiguity regarding endorsement obligations and could lead to disputes over the extent of required brand representation. Because the paragraph that it is referencing is unclear due to redactions, this creates ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'best efforts' is vague and ambiguous. There's no objective standard to determine what constitutes 'best efforts.' This lack of clarity makes it difficult to enforce this obligation and could lead to disputes over whether the consultant has adequately promoted Adams Golf products.",

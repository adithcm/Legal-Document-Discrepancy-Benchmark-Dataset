        "section": "The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees without i-Escrow's consent is a significant ambiguity. The lack of constraints on how the 'Adjusted Rate' is calculated opens it to arbitrary changes, potentially harming i-Escrow financially. This creates a material inconsistency because, without clearly defined limits, it's impossible to ascertain if these 'market conditions' are being fairly assessed or exploited to increase fees disproportionately, making the financial terms highly unpredictable for i-Escrow.",

In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The automatic renewal clause in Section 8.1 contradicts standard business practices and creates potential legal issues. If a party fails to provide notice of non-renewal, the contract automatically renews, which could bind them to unfavorable terms they no longer agree with. This could be viewed as an unconscionable term, especially if one party has significantly more bargaining power. Additionally, perpetual renewals without affirmative consent can lead to disputes about the parties' true intentions and obligations over time.",

Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an internal contradiction. It states that *all* provisions survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete pending transactions, and then *immediately* lists several sections (including key sections like Definitions (1), Disclaimer of Warranties (7), Indemnity (9), and Limitation on Liability (10)) that explicitly do *not* survive termination. This means that critical protections and obligations are unclear if they apply to these pending transactions, leading to significant legal ambiguity.",

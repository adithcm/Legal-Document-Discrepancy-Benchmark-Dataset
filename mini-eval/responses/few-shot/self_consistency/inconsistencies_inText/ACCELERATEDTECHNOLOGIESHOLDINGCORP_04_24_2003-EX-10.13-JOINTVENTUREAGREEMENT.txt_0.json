        "explanation": "The two sentences in this section are presenting conflicting information. The first one is stating that the payments will be made according to the terms specified in sections 1.3 and 1.4, while the second sentence states that all invoices must be paid within 15 days of receipt, regardless of what sections 1.3 and 1.4 say. This creates ambiguity around what terms should be followed when it comes to payments.",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means confidential, non-public information, know-how and data (technical or non-technical) that is disclosed in writing, orally, or graphically by or on behalf of a disclosing Party to a receiving Party or its Affiliates for purposes of this Agreement or any Study Order (\"Purpose\"). However, any information disclosed orally is considered Non-Confidential Information.",
        "explanation": "The text is presenting contradicting information because it is stating that the definition of \"Confidential Information\" includes information that is disclosed in writing, orally, or graphically, but then says that if any information is disclosed orally, it is considered Non-Confidential Information. This does not make sense.",

        "explanation": "This section has conflicting payment terms. The beginning of the section states that all payments will be paid within 45 days, but adds a sentence that if MD Anderson delivers the invoice in person, the payments will be paid by Adaptimmune within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from MD Anderson. This is creating ambiguity around the payment terms.",

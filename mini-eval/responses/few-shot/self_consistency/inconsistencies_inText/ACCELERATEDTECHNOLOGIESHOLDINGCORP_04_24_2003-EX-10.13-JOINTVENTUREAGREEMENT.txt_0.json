        "section": "However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "This clause contradicts the earlier statement that the Joint Venture will last until February 28, 2004, unless extended by written agreement. The unilateral termination clause allows a party to end the agreement before the agreed-upon end date, creating an inconsistency.",

        "explanation": "This clause contradicts Section 9, which states, '...there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint Venture business.' PVSS is guaranteed 10,000 dollars no matter what, and Section 9 says that distributions can only be made if it does not get in the way of necessary costs. This creates ambiguity around distribution of wealth.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value' creates a structural flaw, as this creates an imbalance of power and could lead to unfair valuation of assets.",

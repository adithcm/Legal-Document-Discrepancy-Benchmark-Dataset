        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the procedure for asset distribution upon termination, but then gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. unilateral authority to determine asset valuation in disputes. This contradicts the initial fair distribution principle and potentially disadvantages Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc., creating an imbalance.",

Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This creates ambiguity because it says that distributions can only happen if assets exceed liabilities. However, it also says PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",

However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses repayment upon termination due to the consultant's death or inability to play, but specifies no repayment is required if the inability is due to injury during an Adams Golf event. However, it also states that the consultant's estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, creating an inconsistency.",

        "explanation": "The redacted term length creates ambiguity. Without knowing the specific duration, it's impossible to determine the agreement's end date, which is critical for assessing obligations, termination rights, and overall enforceability. This lack of clarity prevents accurate evaluation of contractual requirements over time.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall not be required to wear ADAMS GOLF [*****] in [*****] ads.",
        "explanation": "This statement's lack of detail introduces ambiguity. The sections it refers to deal with the restrictions on Consultant endorsing competing products. However, by not requiring CONSULTANT to wear ADAMS GOLF [*****] in [*****] ads, it creates an ambiguity because it does not mention why this exclusion exists. It could be inferred that it is acceptable to be wearing a competitor's product, despite the rest of Section 4 restricting him from doing so.",

If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel.",
        "explanation": "The structure is flawed. It does not specify a timeframe in which the two chosen arbitrators must then select the third arbitrator. This can lead to delays, or disagreements on whether the two chosen arbitrators are acting in good faith, and can make the arbitration clause very difficult to enforce.",

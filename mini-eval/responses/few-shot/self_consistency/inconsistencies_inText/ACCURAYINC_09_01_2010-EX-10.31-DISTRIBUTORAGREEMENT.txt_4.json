        "section": "Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This clause is ambiguous because 'non-exclusive, worldwide distributor' is a broad term, but the phrase 'solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases' severely restricts the scope of the distributorship. This creates ambiguity about what constitutes a violation of the non-exclusivity if Siemens sells systems outside of these bundled purchases, causing possible interpretive issues.",

        "explanation": "Schedule 2.3.2 provides the 'Acceptance Process', listing criteria Accuray may consider when approving a quote. However, the listed criteria such as 'Existing exclusivity arrangements between Accuray and Third Parties' or 'Bona fide concerns about the suitability of the proposed purchaser' are vague and open to interpretation, leading to potential disputes over whether Accuray is reasonably withholding approval. Also, the failure to approve or disapprove within 5 business days results in automatic disapproval, irrespective of external circumstances, which might conflict with reasonable business practices.",

        "section": "Distributor shall report promptly and in writing to Accuray any complaints or expressions of dissatisfaction by the Customers to Distributor relating to the Products or Services.",
        "explanation": "The term 'promptly' is ambiguous, as there is no defined timeframe for reporting customer complaints. This lack of clarity could lead to disagreements about whether a complaint was reported in a timely manner, and potential disputes about whether the distributor fulfilled their reporting obligation.",

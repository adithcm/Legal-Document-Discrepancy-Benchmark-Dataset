        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section allows either party to terminate if a Statement of Work (SOW) isn't agreed upon within 2 months. However, Section 2.3 states that if the Launch Date (dependent on the SOW) doesn't occur within 4 months, either party can terminate *if* they've used good faith efforts. The discrepancy lies in the differing conditions for termination \u2013 the SOW disagreement allows termination regardless of effort, while the Launch Date failure requires demonstration of good faith.",

        "section": "This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions ('the Adjusted Rate'), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees formula 'to reflect present market conditions' is ambiguous and could lead to disputes. The term 'present market conditions' is vague and does not define what factors can be considered in the adjustment. This lack of specificity gives 2TheMart broad discretion and creates uncertainty for i-Escrow regarding future payment obligations. Also, allowing an immediate adjustment without i-Escrow's consent could create an unbalance.",

Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This creates an internal inconsistency. The first sentence states that even upon termination for material breach, provisions survive to complete pending transactions. However, the second sentence explicitly lists Section 8.5 (EFFECTS OF TERMINATION) as *not* surviving termination. Since Section 8.5 defines the effects of termination, including obligations to complete pending transactions, there is a direct contradiction.",

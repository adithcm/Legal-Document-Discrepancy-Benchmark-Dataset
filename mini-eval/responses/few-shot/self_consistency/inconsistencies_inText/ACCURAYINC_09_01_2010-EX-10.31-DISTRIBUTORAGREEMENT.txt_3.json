        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "There's ambiguity regarding 'expedited delivery expenses'. The section states Accuray covers these if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the PO submission. However, it does not clearly define what constitutes 'expedited delivery' versus standard shipping. This may cause disputes over which shipping costs are supplementary and who bears the expense.",

        "explanation": "The text creates a misalignment. Initially, Accuray is responsible for all regulatory approvals, but if they lack a presence/distributor in the customer's country, the Distributor may (with consent) be required to enter into a separate distribution agreement making them responsible. This creates a conflict of responsibility, creating confusion.",

        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency because the warranty period is described in two different ways that could lead to different end dates. It is one year following installation OR eighteen months following shipment.",

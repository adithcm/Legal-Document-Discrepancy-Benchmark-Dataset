        "explanation": "This section introduces a potential inconsistency. While the first sentence states that payments will be made according to Sections 1.3 and 1.4, the second sentence mandates that all invoices must be paid within 15 days of receipt, regardless of what 1.3 and 1.4 state. This could lead to disputes if Sections 1.3 and 1.4 specify different payment terms.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"Notwithstanding any other provision, all invoices must be paid within 15 days of receipt,\" contradicts the initial statement, which references Sections 1.3 and 1.4 for payment terms.

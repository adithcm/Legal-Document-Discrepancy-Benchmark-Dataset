        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The clause allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees without i-Escrow's consent. This gives 2TheMart unchecked power to modify the payment terms, which may be unenforceable under general contract law principles requiring mutual agreement for modifications.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction regarding the renewal process. It states that the agreement can be renewed by 'mutual written agreement,' but then continues to say 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' This contradicts the mutual agreement and makes renewal automatic if there is no notice.",

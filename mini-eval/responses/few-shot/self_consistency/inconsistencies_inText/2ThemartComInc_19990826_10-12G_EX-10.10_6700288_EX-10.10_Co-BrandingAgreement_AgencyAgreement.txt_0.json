        "section": "In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.2 states that if the parties do not agree to a SOW within 2 months either party may terminate. Section 2.3 states that if the launch date has not occurred within 4 months after the effective date, either party may terminate. These sections seem misaligned in purpose. They both set a deadline, and if either party doesn't meet the deadline, the other party can terminate. However, agreeing to a SOW and setting a launch date are different things.",

The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This clause gives 2TheMart the unilateral right to change the advertising fees without i-Escrow's consent. Although 2TheMart must communicate the new rate, i-Escrow has no recourse. This could be considered unconscionable or lacking good faith, since one party has complete control over the payment terms without the other party's agreement.",

        "explanation": "This sentence specifies which sections do not survive termination. However, Section 9 provides an indemnity clause, and indemnification obligations typically survive termination of an agreement. By stating that Section 9 does not survive termination, it creates an ambiguity and potential legal contradiction since the indemnity obligations would cease upon termination, defeating the purpose of such a clause.",

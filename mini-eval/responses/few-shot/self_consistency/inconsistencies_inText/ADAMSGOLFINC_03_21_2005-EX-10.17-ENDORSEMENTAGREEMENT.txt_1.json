        "explanation": "The agreement specifies a term of '[* ****] years and [*****] months' starting September 1, 2004, but fails to provide the specific termination date. This omission leads to ambiguity regarding the contract's duration and creates a potential for disputes over its validity period. The lack of a clear end date constitutes an in-text contradiction, especially if different interpretations arise regarding the intended total length of the agreement.",

        "explanation": "This clause creates an inconsistency by not specifying what apparel CONSULTANT should wear or whether there are restrictions. It allows CONSULTANT to not wear ADAMS GOLF apparel, potentially undermining the agreement's endorsement goals. It creates an unclear in-text obligation.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a contradiction by first stating that no repayment is required if failure to play is due to an injury during an Adams Golf promotional event, and then stating that upon such termination, repayment is required. This inconsistency undermines the clarity and enforceability of the termination terms.",

        "section": "Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The language 'not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors' creates ambiguity. It is unclear to what extent Accuray can directly compete with the distributor in the same market or appoint other distributors that directly compete with Siemens. This lacks clarity in defining the distributor's exclusive rights, creating a contradiction in terms.",

Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "The provision that a failure to respond within two weeks constitutes disapproval creates a potential contradiction. If Accuray intends to reject a Purchase Order, it should explicitly do so, rather than relying on passive disapproval, which may lead to uncertainty and disputes.",

        "explanation": "It is not clearly structured how a Purchase Order should be confirmed and how confirmation occurs. This is structurally flawed because of the lack of information.",

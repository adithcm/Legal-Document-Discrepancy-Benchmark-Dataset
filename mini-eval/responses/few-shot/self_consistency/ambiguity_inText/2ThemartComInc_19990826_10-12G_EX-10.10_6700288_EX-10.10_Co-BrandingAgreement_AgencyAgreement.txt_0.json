        "section": "Adaptimmune shall have responsibility for IND filing, however, MD Anderson will handle all monitoring responsibilities.",
        "explanation": "This statement implies that Adaptimmune is generally responsible for both IND filing and monitoring, but makes an exception by assigning the monitoring responsibilities to MD Anderson. This creates an ambiguity, as there is a discrepancy of who is responsible for IND filing and monitoring, due to the original statement.",

        "section": "MD Anderson and Adaptimmune will promptly notify each other upon identifying any aspect of a Protocol, including information discovered during site monitoring visits, or Study results that may adversely affect the safety, well-being, or medical care of the Study subjects, or that may affect the willingness of Study subjects to continue participation in a Study, influence the conduct of the Study, or that may alter the IRB's approval to continue the Study. Adaptimmune is solely responsible for notifying MD Anderson of data results discovered from Adaptimmune's monitoring visits only.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence requires both parties to notify each other of any information that may affect the study. The second sentence limits Adaptimmune's notification responsibility to only data results from its monitoring visits. There is a discrepancy, since both parties are required to report issues but the second sentence seems to limit that reporting.",

The final reconciliation of Data is Adaptimmune's responsibility.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that MD Anderson has the responsibility of the final reconciliation of the Data. The second sentence immediately contradicts that by stating that the final reconciliation of data is Adaptimmune's responsibility. This is a clear discrepancy.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous. Does 'complete at least one transaction per month' mean they need to complete one transaction every month, or just one transaction ever to be considered a 'Customer'? This lack of clarity could lead to disputes, especially regarding the calculation of advertising fees based on transaction inquiries from Customers.",

        "explanation": "The calculation for advertising fees is based on 0.025% of the average transaction amount. It is unclear what 'the amount of the average Transaction' refers to. Is it the total dollar value of all transactions divided by the number of transactions? Or the dollar value of each transaction, and then calculate the average? The ambiguity can cause arguments.",

        "explanation": "The contract's term is not clearly defined because the number of years and months, as well as the termination date, are redacted. This makes it impossible to determine the contract's actual duration and conflicts with standard contract principles requiring definite terms.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The term 'satisfactory record of play' is not defined, leading to ambiguity. Further, the minimum number of tournaments is redacted. This lacks clarity, creating uncertainty about the performance standards required of the consultant and potentially leading to disputes over whether the consultant has met their obligations and whether repayment is required.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination due to the consultant's inability to play, triggered by death or otherwise. It mandates repayment to Adams Golf for the unperformed period, calculated as per paragraph 8A. This section directly contradicts the clause in Section 19.C, which states that, in the event of Adams Golf's insolvency or bankruptcy, Consultant shall not be obligated to repay any money so long as Consultant continues to fully perform his obligations under this Agreement. The contradiction arises because the Consultant is unable to perform his duties due to death or inability to play tour golf. It is unclear whether Section 22 supersedes 19.C or not. This makes it difficult to determine which is followed in the event of Adams Golf's insolvency. ",

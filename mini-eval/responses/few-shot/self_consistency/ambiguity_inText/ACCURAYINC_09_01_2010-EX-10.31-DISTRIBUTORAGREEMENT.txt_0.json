        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section describes that Accuray is responsible for the expedited shipping costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order date. However, it is not clear who is responsible if the distributor would like to expedite the shipping time sooner than the 6 month period. This creates ambiguity.",

        "section": "4.14. Compliance with Laws. Accuray will be responsible for complying with (i) applicable U.S. laws, (ii) where Products are being shipped to Distributor and unless otherwise agreed by Accuray and Distributor, applicable laws, codes, registrations, regulations, and ordinances related to the export of the Products to Distributor, and (iii) any other applicable laws as they pertain to the Products, the regulatory clearance, and safety in accordance with Accuray's written Specifications for the intended use. In addition, Accuray shall be responsible for compliance with any applicable law, code, registration, regulation, and ordinance related to the export of the Products or Services to Customer and/or Distributor, if any (the \"Export Regulations\"), and Accuray shall be liable for any expenses and/or damages incurred by Distributor due to any non-compliance with such Export Regulations by Accuray (unless Accuray is not responsible for such non-compliance). Accuray shall advise Distributor in writing within two weeks of the confirmation of the Purchase Order of any information or data required by Accuray to comply with an Export Regulation, including without limitation: (a) All applicable export list numbers, including the Export Control 11 Classification Number according to the U.S. Commerce Control List (ECCN); (b) The statistical commodity code according to the current commodity classification for foreign trade statistics and the HS (Harmonized System) coding; (c) The country of origin (non-preferential origin); and (d) Accuray's declaration of preferential origin (in case of European suppliers) or preferential certificates (in case of non-European suppliers).",
        "explanation": "The compliance with laws states that Accuray is responsible for compliance with laws, codes, registrations, and ordinances related to the export of the products or services to customer and/or distributor. However, this creates an in-text contradiction with 4.5, which states that Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement. This is an in-text contradiction because one says they are both responsible, and the other says one is solely responsible.",

        "section": "9.2. Third Party Claims. If Distributor promptly notifies Accuray of a claim it has received or of which it becomes aware that the Products or any part thereof purchased by Distributor hereunder infringes a third party's proprietary rights, then Accuray agrees, at its discretion, either to (i) defend the claim at its expense, with the cooperation of Distributor, provided, that Accuray shall reimburse Distributor for any reasonable costs or expenses actually incurred by Distributor in connection with providing such cooperation, or (ii) make changes in the Product or part thereof so that they are at least functionally equivalent and non-infringing or replace the Products with alternatives that are at least functionally equivalent to avoid the claim, or (iii) purchase the right to use such proprietary right or (iv) refund to the purchaser the net book value of the Product less a reasonable deduction for use, wear and tear, and depreciation upon Accuray taking possession of such Product. Notwithstanding Section 10.1, the foregoing states the entire liability of Accuray with respect to infringement of patents or other proprietary rights by the Products or part thereof, or by their operation. To remove all doubt, Accuray has no obligation regarding any claim based on any of the following: (a) modification of the Products by any person other than Accuray; (b) combination, operation or use of the Products with other products, parts, components, materials or accessories not provided by Accuray; or (c) infringement by a product not manufactured by Accuray.",
        "explanation": "Section 9.2 states that Accuray may defend the claim at its expense, which includes reimbursement for costs. Section 10.1 also addresses Accuray indemnity, suggesting they will defend and hold harmless. This creates a structural flaw because the section can be interpretted in different ways.",

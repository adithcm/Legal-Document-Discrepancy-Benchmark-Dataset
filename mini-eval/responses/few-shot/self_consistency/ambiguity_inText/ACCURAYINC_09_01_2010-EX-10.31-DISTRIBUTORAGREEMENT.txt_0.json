        "section": "1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement. The following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning: 1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions specifically for CyberKnife products and services (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, excluding Australia, India, and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Accuray Regions\" includes contradictory information. It initially states that APAC excludes Australia, India, and Japan but then separately lists Japan as an Accuray region. This creates confusion as to whether Japan is considered part of APAC for the purposes of this agreement.",

Distributor shall be and must at all times make it clear that it is an independent entity contracting with Accuray, and is not the employee, representative or agent of Accuray, except when explicitly authorized by Accuray in writing. Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner, unless such authority is expressly delegated to the Distributor by Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states the Distributor isn't an agent of Accuray, but the second sentence says they don't have authority to enter into legal agreements unless authority is delegated to them, which is something agents do, thus the sentences contradict each other.",

Accuray will endeavor to provide to Distributor or Customer, as applicable, in a timely manner those Products and Services required to fill confirmed Purchase Orders received from Distributor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The wording 'Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied meet minimum quality standards' is not structured properly. This means that it is not easy to comprehend as it contains multiple clauses and does not make sense. This also means that it is hard to enforce because it is vague.",

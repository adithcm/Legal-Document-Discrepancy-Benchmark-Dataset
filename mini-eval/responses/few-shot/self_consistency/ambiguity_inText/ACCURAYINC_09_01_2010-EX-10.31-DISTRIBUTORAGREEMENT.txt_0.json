        "section": "Adaptimmune shall have responsibility for IND filing, however, MD Anderson will handle all monitoring responsibilities.",
        "explanation": "In the original text, Adaptimmune has responsibility for both IND filing and monitoring. The modified text splits these responsibilities, assigning IND filing to Adaptimmune but monitoring responsibilities to MD Anderson. This contradicts the original allocation of responsibilities.",

        "section": "MD Anderson and Adaptimmune will promptly notify each other upon identifying any aspect of a Protocol, including information discovered during site monitoring visits, or Study results that may adversely affect the safety, well-being, or medical care of the Study subjects, or that may affect the willingness of Study subjects to continue participation in a Study, influence the conduct of the Study, or that may alter the IRB's approval to continue the Study. Adaptimmune is solely responsible for notifying MD Anderson of data results discovered from Adaptimmune's monitoring visits only.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence requires both parties to notify each other of any adverse events, while the added second sentence restricts Adaptimmune's notification responsibility to only data results from its monitoring visits. This creates a contradiction because Adaptimmune is now only responsible for reporting data from its own monitoring visits, but not any other adverse events, while both parties should be informing each other.",

The final reconciliation of Data is Adaptimmune's responsibility.",
        "explanation": "The first part says MD Anderson has the responsbility of reconciling the data and then the second sentence contradicts that by saying Adaptimmune is resposible for the reconciliation of the data. This creates a contradiction regarding which party is responsible for the final reconciliation of data.",

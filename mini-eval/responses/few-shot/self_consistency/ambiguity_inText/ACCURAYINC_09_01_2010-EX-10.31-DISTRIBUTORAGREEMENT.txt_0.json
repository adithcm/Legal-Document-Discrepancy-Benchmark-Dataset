        "explanation": "The language is vague as to what it means to be a 'non-exclusive, worldwide distributor...subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.' The phrase is missing key specifics. The specifics are not clearly outlined in the terms and conditions of this agreement. What Products or Services are included and what Products and Services are not included? What are the specific geographic regions?",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency regarding who bears supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery. It states that Accuray bears the costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission. However, it later states that if the delivery date is shorter than six months, the Distributor will bear the costs. This discrepancy needs clarification to avoid disputes.",

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts of International Sale of Goods (CISG) and the provisions of German private international law.",
        "explanation": "The exclusion of 'the provisions of German private international law' creates ambiguity. This suggests that the agreement intentionally avoids conflict-of-law rules within Germany, which could affect how disputes are resolved if they involve parties or transactions linked to other countries, creating confusion about the legal standards that apply.",

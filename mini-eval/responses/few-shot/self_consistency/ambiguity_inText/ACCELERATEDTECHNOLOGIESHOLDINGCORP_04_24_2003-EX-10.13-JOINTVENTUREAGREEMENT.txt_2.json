        "section": "by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\")",
        "explanation": "The agreement explicitly states that the parties are associating as 'business associates' and 'not as partners' but then refers to the formation of a 'joint venture'. While a joint venture is a business arrangement, the precise legal implications can vary, and the attempt to distinguish it from a partnership creates potential ambiguity. Depending on the jurisdiction and the specifics of the arrangement, a joint venture can be treated as a partnership for certain legal purposes. The declaration that it is 'not a partnership' may not be legally binding if the characteristics of the arrangement align more closely with a partnership under applicable law. Also the Parties are referred to as 'Joint Venturers' adding more ambiguity to if they are not partners.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction regarding the distribution of assets upon termination. While unexpended funds are to be distributed according to the parties' pro-rata ownership, 'all other assets' are to be distributed at the sole discretion of a third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' ownership interests. This is contradictory and unreasonable because it deprives the joint venturers of their ownership interest in the assets of the joint venture. This clause could be deemed unenforceable because it allows a third-party mediator to unilaterally decide how assets are distributed, which conflicts with standard principles of property rights and potentially violates the parties' reasonable expectations.",

        "explanation": "Section 9 states distributions are to be made ratably according to Section 6, while Section 11 provides an alternative distribution method via third-party mediator, with it's own distribution method based on their own discretion. It is unclear which will be followed in practice and leads to confusion.",

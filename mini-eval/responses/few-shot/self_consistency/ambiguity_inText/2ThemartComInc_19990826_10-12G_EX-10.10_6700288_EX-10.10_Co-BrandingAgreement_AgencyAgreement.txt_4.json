        "section": "\"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'CUSTOMERS' requires completion of at least one transaction *per month*. This creates an internal contradiction because users who complete one transaction but not necessarily every month would be customers, making the definition's ongoing monthly requirement unclear and unenforceable.",

        "explanation": "The calculation of advertising fees based on '0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction' is ambiguous. It's unclear what exactly the 0.025% is taken from, the whole transaction or a part of it. Also, there is ambiguity in the calculation - multiplying a percentage by an amount does not compute.",

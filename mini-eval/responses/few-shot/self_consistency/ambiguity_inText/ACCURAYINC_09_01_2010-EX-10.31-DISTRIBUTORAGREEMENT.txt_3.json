        "explanation": "While the text indicates a worldwide distributorship, subsequent sections introduce limitations based on Accuray's direct presence or existing distributors in specific countries. This creates a potential ambiguity regarding the scope of the 'worldwide' distributorship and could lead to disputes.",

        "explanation": "This clause says the distributor has a worldwide distributorship. However, section 4.4. and 4.5. describe that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of Systems specifically for the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor to enter into a distribution agreement. This means the worldwide distributorship is not really worldwide and causes some inconsistencies.",

Accuray may, in its sole and absolute discretion, approve any such opportunity, and if approved in writing by Accuray, Distributor shall otherwise be permitted to pursue such opportunity at such prices, which opportunity shall otherwise be governed by and pursued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Accuray has sole and absolute discretion to approve opportunities for sales of Products and Services at prices differing from the current price list. However, Schedule 2.3.2 states that the approval of any such proposed purchase must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, contradicting the idea of absolute discretion.",

        "section": "(c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous and potentially contradictory in practice. The definition implies a recurring action ('at least one transaction per month'), suggesting a subscription-based or ongoing activity. However, the core service being provided (Escrow Services) is typically used for discrete, one-time transactions related to auction items. This creates an inconsistency in expectations and could lead to confusion on how the term is applied, particularly regarding advertising fees calculation and reporting metrics.",

This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter.",
        "explanation": "The calculation of advertising fees is based on the 'average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter.' However, 'Transaction Inquiry' is defined in Section 1(l) as merely the submission of a form, 'regardless of whether or not any Transaction is completed.' This means i-Escrow is paying for inquiries, not necessarily completed transactions, and the payment is calculated based on completed 'Transactions'. This inconsistency in definitions causes a mismatch.",

Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that Force Majeure does not limit obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification). However, indemnification obligations often arise from a party's failure to perform an obligation under the agreement. If that failure is caused by a Force Majeure event, it seems contradictory to then require indemnification. This creates ambiguity as to whether a Force Majeure event can ever excuse an indemnification obligation.",

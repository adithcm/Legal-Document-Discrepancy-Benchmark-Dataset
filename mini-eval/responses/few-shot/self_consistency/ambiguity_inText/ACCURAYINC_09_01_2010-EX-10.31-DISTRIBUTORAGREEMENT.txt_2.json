        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an ambiguity. While it specifies that Accuray covers expedited delivery costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, it doesn't explicitly state who bears these costs if Accuray fails to meet the standard lead time (stated in 2.4 as six months) due to its own internal issues. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes over who is responsible for expedited shipping if Accuray's delays cause the need for it.",

        "section": "4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor ('Warranty Period'). 'Installation' of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.",
        "explanation": "This section disclaims implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which are standard in commercial transactions. However, depending on the jurisdiction, these disclaimers may not be enforceable, especially for sales to end-users (Customers) who are considered consumers. By broadly disclaiming these warranties 'to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law', the contract creates a risk that it violates consumer protection laws in certain regions, leading to unenforceability of this clause.",

WITHOUT AFFECTING STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY UNDER MANDATORY APPLICABLE LAW, SECTION 10, OR THE RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THE CONFIDENTIAILITY AGREEMENT AND EXCEPT FOR BREACHES ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR TORT DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to exclude liability for consequential damages. However, the enforceability of such exclusions varies by jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, excluding liability for consequential damages for certain types of breaches (e.g., gross negligence, willful misconduct) is against public policy and thus unenforceable. This clause is an attempt to limit liability but its validity will depend on applicable laws at the time of a dispute.",

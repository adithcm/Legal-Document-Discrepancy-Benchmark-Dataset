        "section": "(c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'CUSTOMERS' is ambiguous. It states that a customer must complete 'at least one transaction per month'. This is problematic because it is not clear whether this is in reference to how the advertising fees work, or whether this is in reference to how i-Escrow should classify their client base. This definition seems to suggest that if a user does not complete a transaction within a given month, they are no longer considered a 'customer'. This would affect the payment structure outlined in section 5.1 where i-Escrow will pay 2TheMart based on the amount of transactions from 'all Customers'. This vague term could lead to miscommunication on how the fees should be calculated.",

Once approved, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently implement their respective obligations under the SOW.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the deadlines. Section 2.2 allows either party to terminate if an SOW isn't agreed upon within 2 months. However, section 2.3 allows either party to terminate if the 'Launch Date' hasn't occurred within 4 months following the effective date. It is possible that an SOW may be approved quickly, but i-Escrow is unable to launch the Information Transfer Mechanism. This creates a contradiction since i-Escrow may have been diligently working on their duties under the SOW, but circumstances do not allow them to launch the product. It also does not state what happens if an SOW is approved and the parties launch date takes longer than 4 months. This could lead to a legal dispute.",

This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions.",
        "explanation": "The wording about calculating advertising fees is ambiguous. It states that the fees will be calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. This does not state whether 0.025% should be the percentage that is being multiplied by the average transaction. If 0.025% is the percentage, then that would mean that 0.00025 would be multiplied by the amount of the average transaction. It is unclear if the author means to say 2.5% instead of 0.025%.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section requires repayment if Watson can't play due to death or inability, yet Section 8A only covers repayment for failing to meet the minimum number of tournaments. Applying 8A to death/inability creates an illogical outcome, as 8A's formula doesn't account for such scenarios.",

        "explanation": "Consultant is not obligated to repay money during Adams Golf's insolvency/bankruptcy as long as he continues to fully perform his obligations. This could be interpreted as requiring Watson to continue endorsing ADAMS GOLF products, even if Adams Golf is unable to fulfill its financial obligations, potentially conflicting with Watson's own financial interests and ability to secure alternative endorsements.",

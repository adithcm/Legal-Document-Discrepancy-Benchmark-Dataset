        "explanation": "The redacted term length creates ambiguity because the exact duration of the contract is unknown. Without a defined end date, it is impossible to accurately calculate obligations or enforce termination rights, as the contract period is a fundamental element of the agreement.",

In all such interviews and appearances, CONSULTANT will use his best efforts to make reference to the ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT and wear [*****] and display ADAMS GOLF'S brand name.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'best efforts' is used to describe the consultant's obligation to promote ADAMS GOLF's product. The lack of a clear standard for measuring 'best efforts' makes this obligation unenforceable. Also, the redacted content adds ambiguity, as the consultant's exact obligations (like mandatory attire) are unknown.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Requiring repayment from the consultant's estate if he dies or becomes unable to play is unreasonable and could be deemed unconscionable. While repayment for non-performance due to other reasons might be acceptable, forcing the estate to repay when the consultant's inability to perform stems from death creates a contradictory enforcement mechanism and raises ethical concerns.",

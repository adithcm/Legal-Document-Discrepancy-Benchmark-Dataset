        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image solely in print advertising campaigns for ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. This excludes any personal appearances or television commercials.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is limited to print advertising campaigns. However, section 11.A mentions radio and TV appearances. This misalignment creates ambiguity because the consultant is expected to make references to Adams Golf products and wear branded apparel in radio and TV appearances, which arguably constitutes an endorsement that goes beyond the defined scope.",

The decision on whether to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT in a specific tournament will be at the sole discretion of the CONSULTANT based on performance considerations. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This clause allows the consultant to use clubs other than Adams Golf, but forbids endorsing these clubs. However, in section 6, if the consultant endorses a non-competitive product, the agreement states that any product should be an Adams Golf product. If the consultant uses a non-Adams Golf club (as allowed in section 5) while endorsing a non-competitive product, this may create an issue, as the Consultant is forbidden from endorsing other clubs, but the agreement encourages them to use only Adams Golf products.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "The initial part of this clause states that Adams Golf is indemnified from all expenses, excluding attorney fees. The added statement that Adams Golf will cover attorney fees up to $10,000 creates an in-text contradiction with the initial exclusion. This gives ambiguity as to what the limit is when it comes to attorney fees.",

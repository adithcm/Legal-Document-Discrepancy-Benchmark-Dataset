        "section": "This Services Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is entered into on October 1, 2019 and is made effective as of November 1, 2019 (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between [ * * * ] (the \"Provider\"), and TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD., a company organized and existing under the laws of Singapore and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel (each and both of them \"Recipient\").",
        "explanation": "The agreement identifies two distinct entities, TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, as 'Recipient'. Later clauses may not clearly differentiate obligations or rights between these two entities, creating potential ambiguity as to which 'Recipient' is being referred to, especially where specific actions or entitlements are involved. This lack of clarity introduces potential for disputes regarding which entity the obligations apply to or which benefits are intended for.",

However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction because the first sentence implies an obligation on the Provider to provide services as per Exhibit A. However, the following sentence negates this by stating the Provider is not obligated to respond to requests for additional services 'necessary for the operation of the Recipient' unless it 'deems it fit and feasible'. This creates ambiguity as to the scope of the Provider's mandatory services and allows the Provider broad discretion to refuse services, potentially undermining the agreement's purpose. The term 'necessary for the operation of the Recipient' is not clearly defined either, which can cause further disagreement.",

        "explanation": "The sentence 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement...' is structurally flawed and does not make sense. The structure of this beginning of the section makes the entire section confusing and not legally sound.",

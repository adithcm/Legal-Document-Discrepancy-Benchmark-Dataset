        "explanation": "The agreement is signed on October 1, 2019, but it's made effective as of November 1, 2019. Services provided between those dates are not clearly covered. This can cause ambiguity about the responsibilities between the parties during this period and who is responsible.",

        "explanation": "This section grants the Provider broad discretion to deny requests for additional services necessary for the Recipient's operation. This weakens the overall agreement and could lead to disputes if the Recipient believes those services were implicitly part of the agreement. It's an omission on what is considered necessary for the Recipient.",

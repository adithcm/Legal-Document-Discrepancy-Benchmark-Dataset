        "section": "Accuray wishes to appoint Distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the Products and Services to Customer in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Distributor wishes to accept such appointment.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Distributor' in Section 1.3 includes Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party granted distribution rights by Siemens. However, the Recitals state that Accuray wishes to appoint the Distributor, implying a direct appointment. This creates ambiguity because it's unclear whether Accuray is directly appointing only Siemens, or also any third party Siemens designates.",

        "section": "Accuray will be responsible for complying with (i) applicable U.S. laws, (ii) where Products are being shipped to Distributor and unless otherwise agreed by Accuray and Distributor, applicable laws, codes, registrations, regulations, and ordinances related to the export of the Products to Distributor, and (iii) any other applicable laws as they pertain to the Products, the regulatory clearance, and safety in accordance with Accuray's written Specifications for the intended use. In addition, Accuray shall be responsible for compliance with any applicable law, code, registration, regulation, and ordinance related to the export of the Products or Services to Customer and/or Distributor, if any (the \"Export Regulations\"), and Accuray shall be liable for any expenses and/or damages incurred by Distributor due to any non-compliance with such Export Regulations by Accuray (unless Accuray is not responsible for such non-compliance).",
        "explanation": "This section has an inconsistency: it states Accuray is responsible for export regulations compliance and liable for damages from non-compliance, 'unless Accuray is not responsible for such non-compliance.' This clause weakens Accuray's obligation and creates uncertainty because it doesn't specify the conditions under which Accuray would not be responsible, potentially leading to disputes.",

        "explanation": "This governing law clause excludes 'the provisions of German private international law', which includes conflict of laws rules. By excluding these rules, the contract may not be able to determine which jurisdiction's laws apply if there is a conflict, creating ambiguity and potential unenforceability issues.",

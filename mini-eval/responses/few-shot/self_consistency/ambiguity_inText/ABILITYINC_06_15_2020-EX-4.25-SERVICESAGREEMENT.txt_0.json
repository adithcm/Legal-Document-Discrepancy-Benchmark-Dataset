        "explanation": "The initial statement obligates the Provider to deliver services as outlined in Exhibit A. However, this obligation is immediately weakened by the subsequent statement that Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible. This creates an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "Section 1.2(c) states that Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider. This is then contradicted by section 1.2(e), stating that Provider can use subcontractors but remains fully responsible, financially and otherwise, for the Services provided by each subcontractor. This creates an in-text contradiction since subcontractors by definition are not dedicated solely to the Recipient.",

        "explanation": "The contract has a conflicting term with its start date. The agreement is made effective as of November 1, 2019. This section states that the agreement terminates on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2. The date of the termination is approximately a year after the start date. The termination date does not give enough time for either party to assess the agreement or to successfully implement the contract. By legal standards this section is vague.",

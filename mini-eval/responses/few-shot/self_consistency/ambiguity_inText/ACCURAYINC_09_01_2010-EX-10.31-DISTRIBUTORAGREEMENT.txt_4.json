        "explanation": "The definition of 'Distributor' in Section 1.3 includes 'Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.' However, the recitals suggest only Siemens is being appointed, creating ambiguity about whether Siemens' Affiliates and Third Parties automatically gain distributorship rights or if further action is required.",

The current price list for Products and Services effective as of the Effective Date will be provided to Distributor contemporaneously with the delivery of this fully executed Agreement to Distributor. Such price lists will be subject to change from time to time in Accuray's sole discretion, and Accuray shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Distributor with updated pricing on a regular basis, provided that pricing included in a Quote delivered by Accuray to Distributor shall reflect Accuray's current up-to-date pricing unless otherwise agreed. Updated price lists shall not apply to valid Quotes 2 issued by Accuray and subject to acceptance by Distributor prior to the effective date of such updated price lists.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.2.1 requires Accuray to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Distributor with updated pricing. However, the text does not define what constitutes 'commercially reasonable efforts' or a 'regular basis,' which may lead to disputes regarding the timeliness and adequacy of pricing updates.",

        "explanation": "The text mentions 'Section 444, second alternative German Civil Code shall not apply.' However, the document does not clarify the implications of excluding this section, which creates ambiguity for those unfamiliar with the German Civil Code and could lead to misunderstandings about liability.",

        "section": "This Services Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is entered into on October 1, 2019 and is made effective as of November 1, 2019 (the \"Effective Date\") ... shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",
        "explanation": "The agreement is set to terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier per Section 3.2. Section 3.2 allows termination with 90 days' written notice. If notice to terminate was given at the beginning of the agreement, between November 1, 2019 and March 31, 2020, termination would occur before December 31, 2020, according to Section 3.1. However, if notice were given on March 31, 2020, the agreement would extend to June 29, 2020, which is before December 31, 2020. But if the notice was given on October 1, 2020, the agreement would extend to December 30, 2020, near the termination date, but before the set termination date of December 31, 2020. If the termination notice were given on or after October 2, 2020, the agreement would extend into 2021, violating the initial termination date. This discrepancy allows an inconsistency regarding the termination date of the agreement.",

Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section requires Provider Representatives to be solely dedicated to the Recipient. However, Section 1.2(e) allows Provider to use subcontractors, stating Provider is not released from responsibility and remains fully responsible for the services provided by subcontractors. This creates a misalignment because subcontractors could be seen as Provider Representatives, contradicting the sole dedication requirement, since subcontractors may work for other clients.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'Provider's actual cost of providing the Services' is overly broad and may lack clarity as to what costs are included or excluded in the amount. There is an ambiguity in text on what actual costs mean, leading to potential conflicts over reimbursement.",

        "section": "This agreement shall begin upon the date of its execution by MA and acceptance in writing by Company and shall remain in effect until the end of the current calendar year and shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods unless otherwise terminated according to the cancellation or termination provisions contained in paragraph 18 of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The termination clause states that the agreement automatically renews for one-year periods unless terminated per paragraph 18. However, paragraph 18 also allows termination at the expiration of its term or any renewal term upon thirty (30) days written notice, creating ambiguity about the timing of termination relative to the renewal.",

        "explanation": "This contradicts Section 7.1 (Payment Terms), which ties payment schedules directly to 'Companys current price list in effect at the time an order is received by Company as set forth in Schedule A'. The potential to change the terms with only 10 days' notice undermines the payment structure linked to purchase levels and volume as detailed in schedule A.",

        "explanation": "Imposing the service fee 'for each month that MA has no sales' creates a structural flaw. The Service Fee is to be paid quarterly, but is charged based on months with no sales. It's unclear how the quarterly payment aligns with monthly sales performance.",

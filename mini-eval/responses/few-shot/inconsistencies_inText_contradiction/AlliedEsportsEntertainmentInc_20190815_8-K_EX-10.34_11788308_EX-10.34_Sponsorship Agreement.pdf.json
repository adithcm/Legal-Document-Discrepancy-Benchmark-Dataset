        "section": "2.2 Including, Includes and similar words means including but not limited to and shall mean in all contexts without limitation.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Including' is ambiguous. It states 'including but not limited to' which is standard but then adds 'and shall mean in all contexts without limitation.' This creates ambiguity. Does this mean the examples following 'including' are purely illustrative (as the 'not limited to' part suggests), or that the term 'including' should be interpreted as something more expansive than typically understood, potentially altering the scope of provisions where it is used?",

        "explanation": "The terms 'where possible and appropriate' and 'where reasonably practicable' introduce ambiguity. They lack specific guidelines as to what constitutes 'possible', 'appropriate', or 'reasonably practicable', allowing Allied considerable discretion in determining when to actively promote Newegg's exclusivity. This weakens Newegg's exclusivity rights.",

        "section": "15.10 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California. Before any Party (the Complaining Party) may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the Non Complaining Party), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Partys complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrators award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "This section contains inconsistencies. It states that the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts in Los Angeles County. However, it then states that any dispute shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County. This contradiction creates uncertainty as to whether disputes will be resolved in court or through arbitration.",

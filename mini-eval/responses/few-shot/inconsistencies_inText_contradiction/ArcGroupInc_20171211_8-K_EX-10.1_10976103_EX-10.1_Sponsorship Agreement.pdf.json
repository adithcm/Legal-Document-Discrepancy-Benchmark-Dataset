        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sponsor shall have until December 15th of each applicable contract year to make the final payment without penalty.",
        "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. Section 3(a) states that all installments are due by November 1st, but the added sentence allows the final payment to be made as late as December 15th without penalty. This creates ambiguity as to the actual deadline for the final installment and whether late fees would apply between November 2nd and December 15th.",

If any portion of the Annual Trade Value is not used at the end of the Term, Club shall be permitted to use such unused amount within twelve (12) months following expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The wording regarding the unused Annual Trade Value is inconsistent. While unused amounts carry forward yearly, the contract doesn't explicitly state what happens if the agreement is terminated early. It's ambiguous whether the Club can still use the remaining value within 12 months of early termination or if this benefit is forfeited.",

        "explanation": "There's a slight inconsistency in the text because the Sponsor has to train the staff while they also have to undergo training provided by the Concessionaire. It is unclear what happens when the two conflict with each other.",

Otherwise, payment will be made quarterly.*",
        "explanation": "The clause regarding the minimum threshold of 100 applications creates ambiguity. It does not specify what happens if the affiliate does not reach the minimum in a quarter. Does the commission get forfeited, or does it roll over to the next quarter? This omission affects the payment terms and affiliate's expected earnings.",

        "explanation": "The condition that the affiliate 'actively promotes Chase products in accordance with Chase's evolving marketing strategies' is vague and subjective. It's not clear what constitutes 'actively promotes' or what 'Chase's evolving marketing strategies' are, which gives Chase broad discretion to deny commissions and creates uncertainty for the affiliate.",

        "explanation": "This clause, combined with the fact that all other provisions are subject to change without notice except for posting on the website, is overly broad. It allows Chase to unilaterally change any term, including material terms such as commission rates, without direct notice to the affiliate, potentially making the agreement illusory or unconscionable under some jurisdictions.",

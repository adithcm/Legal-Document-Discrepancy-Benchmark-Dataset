        "section": "This agreement shall begin upon the date of its execution by MA and acceptance in writing by Company and shall remain in effect until the end of the current calendar year and shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods unless otherwise terminated according to the cancellation or termination provisions contained in paragraph 18 of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The section lacks clarity regarding what constitutes the 'current calendar year' for the initial term. Given the agreement is dated May 8, 2014, it's unclear if the initial term ends December 31, 2014, or December 31 of the following year, leading to ambiguity.",

MA will notify Company immediately in the event that it is unable to respond effectively to any end users requests.",
        "explanation": "This section is missing clear definition of MA's responsibility for customer and technical support. Without clearly defined standards for support levels, response times, or issue resolution procedures, there is no clear understanding for MA and Company on support obligation.",

        "explanation": "Although the territory is defined as \"Worldwide\", Section 2.2 limits MA's right to 'advertise, market and sell' only to 'corporate users, government agencies and educational facilities' for specific purposes. This creates an inconsistency in whether MA can market to any entity worldwide, regardless of its nature.",

        "explanation": "This section states that 'all use of Chase Marks by Affiliate is subject to the prior written approval of Chase'. However, Section 6 mentions that 'Affiliate may select or remove Links, at any time without prior approval from Chase.' This creates an inconsistency because removing a link with a Chase mark wouldn't reasonably require approval, but this section implies it would.",

        "explanation": "It is structurally flawed to say it will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, including its conflict with law provisions, because typically conflict of law provisions are designed to determine which jurisdiction's laws should apply, and explicitly including Delaware's conflicts principles can introduce ambiguity.",

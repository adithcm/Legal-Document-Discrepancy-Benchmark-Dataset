        "section": "Beverage Agreement means that certain Beverage Agreement, Pepsi dated January 1, 2011.",
        "explanation": "This agreement repeatedly emphasizes the importance of the 'Beverage Agreement' with Pepsi, yet includes a specific clause in Section 3.4 stating that 'the service will not contain any material that depicts or advertises products competitive to the Beverage Agreement (except as an incidental product placement in content not created by NCM)'. This seems contradictory as the initial agreement appears to promote Pepsi products yet it cannot promote advertisement of any other product?",

        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency within this section. The beginning states that it is 'subject to the provisions of Section 2.3 with respect to transfer of title to NCM Equipment, at least thirty (30) days prior to any Disposition'. However, Section 2.3 states that 'Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason, Network Affiliate shall pay NCM the value of the NCM Equipment, if any, that remains on NCMs financial statements as of the time of such expiration or termination.' The thirty (30) days should be after the termination date, and not before.",

        "explanation": "There is an ambiguity in this section due to the nature of describing something as 'non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, royalty-free limited license to the object code version of the Software on Equipment at Theatres solely for the limited purpose of performing this Agreement'. The 'limited license' is too broad and needs to have better clarification.",

        "section": "WHEREAS, the Blockchain Administrator will also serve as the Fund's investment adviser (the \"Adviser\") pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement entered into by and between the Fund and the Adviser (as amended from time to time, the \"Advisory Agreement\") and WHEREAS, the Fund bears all costs and expenses incurred in its operation, administration and transactions which are not specifically assumed by the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement or this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the Blockchain Administrator will also serve as the Fund's investment advisor. However, section 1(e) states that the Blockchain Administrator shall not provide any advice or recommendation relating to the securities and other assets that the Fund should purchase, retain or sell or any other investment advisory services to the Fund. This is a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section discusses service providers operating in conformity with the requirements of the Investment Company Act, but it doesn't explicitly state that the Blockchain Administrator itself must also adhere to the Investment Company Act in its own operations and responsibilities. While it's implied, the omission of this direct statement creates a potential ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "This section allows for termination by the Blockchain Administrator. However, section 7(b) states that the agreement shall continue automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (A) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund and (B) the vote of a majority of the Fund's directors who are not parties to this Agreement or \"interested persons\". This creates a contradiction as to how the agreement can continue if the Blockchain Administrator terminates the agreement.",

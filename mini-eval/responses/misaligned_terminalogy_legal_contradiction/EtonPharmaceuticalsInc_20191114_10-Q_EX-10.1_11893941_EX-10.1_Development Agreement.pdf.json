        "section": "Term. The term of this Agreement shall automatically become effective upon the occurrence of (i) ETON executing a commercial supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization within forty-five (45) days of the Execution Date, provided that ETON has exercised best efforts to execute such agreement and the failure to execute is solely caused by the refusal or inability of the proposed manufacturing organization to sign a reasonable agreement and (ii) acceptance for review of the Dossier or marketing application for [ * * * ] by the FDA no later than September 2, 2019 (such date, the Effective Date) and shall end upon the termination or expiration of the Agreement as set forth in Section 11 (the Term). For avoidance of doubt, all rights conferred to ETON under this Agreement for the purpose of allowing ETON to Market the Product in the Territory shall continue until a Party terminates this Agreement. Aucta should continue to receive 15% of Net Sales Royalty for as long as ETON is selling the Product(s) in the Territory, unless otherwise agreed to under this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence defines the Term based on specific conditions (execution of an agreement and FDA acceptance), while the third sentence suggests that ETON's rights continue until termination, implying a potentially longer period. The final sentence regarding royalty payments further complicates the Term definition, as it suggests royalty payments continue as long as ETON sells the product, regardless of the defined Term. This creates ambiguity about the actual duration of the agreement and payment obligations.",

        "explanation": "Subsections (ii) and (iii) both contain the clause 'to the extent such is not attributable to ETONs breach of this Agreement or any Applicable Laws.' This clause effectively nullifies Aucta's indemnification obligation if ETON contributes to the issue through their own breach or violation of laws. This creates an inconsistency, as Aucta is supposed to indemnify ETON from any and all losses arising from the listed conditions. The exception significantly limits the scope of indemnification, making it unclear under what circumstances Aucta would actually be liable, especially considering ETON controls much of the marketing and distribution.",

        "explanation": "The term 'ex-U.S. government' is not a standard legal term and creates ambiguity. It's unclear if this refers to any government outside the U.S., or specifically to governmental entities involved in a previous transaction with the U.S. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes about which party is responsible for Transfer Taxes in various international contexts.",

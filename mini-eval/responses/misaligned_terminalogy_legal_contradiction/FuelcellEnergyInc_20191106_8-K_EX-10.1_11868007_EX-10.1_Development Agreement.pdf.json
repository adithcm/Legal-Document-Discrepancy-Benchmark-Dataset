        "section": "4.05 Exceptions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and restricted use herein shall not apply to any information or materials to the extent the Receiving Party can establish by documentary evidence that one or more of the following exceptions apply:\n\na. the information or material was already in the Receiving Partys or its Affiliates lawful possession (free of any confidentiality and use restrictions) and was not previously acquired directly or indirectly from the other Party under a current obligation of confidentiality\n\nb. the information or material was already in the public domain or subsequently entered the public domain after disclosure through no fault of the Receiving Party\n\nc. the information or material was or is hereafter furnished to the Receiving Party, or its Affiliate, on a non- confidential basis by a third party legally entitled to provide the information or material without restriction\n\nd. the information or material was independently developed by employees or agents of the Receiving Party or its Affiliate who did not have access to relevant information provided by the Disclosing Party and/or\n\ne. the information or material was released from the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement by the Disclosing Partys written authorization.\n\nThe later occurrence of any one of the aforementioned exceptions will not excuse any failure to adequately protect Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement prior to the existence of the exception. More specific Confidential Information will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is publicly available or in the possession of Receiving Party pursuant to one of the exceptions. Also a combination of features will not be deemed within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are publicly available or in Receiving Partys possession pursuant to one of the exceptions.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph states that the confidentiality obligations do not apply if the information was already in the public domain. However, it also states that the later occurrence of the information becoming public does not excuse prior failures to protect the information. This is a contradiction because it implies that even if the information is now public, there can still be liability for not protecting it before it became public, which contradicts the exception itself. If the exception applies once the information is public, there should be no ongoing liability.",

        "section": "5.01 Publicity. During the Term, and except for disclosures pursuant to Paragraphs 4.06 (Disclosure to Affiliates, Contractors and Sub-licensees), 4.07 (Compelled Disclosure), 4.08 (Disclosure in Patent Applications), or as otherwise permitted in this Agreement, the Parties agree that they will not disclose to any Non-Affiliated Third Party that they have entered into this Agreement, nor make any publications or publicity releases concerning the nature of this Agreement, without first acquiring the written consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may make such disclosure as it may determine to be required by applicable law (such as filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), provided that in such case the Disclosing Party will provide advance notice of such disclosure to the other Party and, where legally permitted, an opportunity to redact its sensitive proprietary information from such disclosure. Further, during the Term, each Party agrees that it will not use the name, service mark or trademark of the other Party, or any Affiliate of the other Party, or provide any indication from which the identity of the other Party or its Affiliate may reasonably be inferred in any publicity release or other announcement, without first obtaining the written approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party hereby grants approval for the other Party to use its name, service mark or trademark in promotional materials that have a generally accepted description of the Scope, which such generally accepted description shall be mutually agreed to in writing beforehand. An exception to this Paragraph will include U.S. patent prosecution that refers to this Agreement as a joint research agreement under 35 U.S.C.  102(c). Further, each Party agrees to include appropriate attribution of the other Party in any publicity release, advertising, print, media or other announcement concerning the use of MCFCs for carbon capture, the Program or the Program Results.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence says that each party agrees to include appropriate attribution of the other party in any publicity release, advertising, print, media or other announcement concerning the use of MCFCs for carbon capture, the Program or the Program Results. However, the beginning of the section states that the parties agree they will not disclose to any Non-Affiliated Third Party that they have entered into this Agreement, nor make any publications or publicity releases concerning the nature of this Agreement, without first acquiring the written consent of the other Party. This is a contradiction because the last sentence is ordering for there to be publicity releases when the first part of the section is saying that there should not be any.",

        "section": "12.03 Failure to Perform. If ExxonMobil fails to fulfill a material monetary obligation or FCE fails to execute material tasks or obligations in material compliance with all criteria set forth in a respective mutually agreed upon Project Description, in the time and manner required herein, provided that in the case of FCEs tasks or obligations any non-compliance or delay in meeting said criteria is not due to ExxonMobil or force majeure pursuant to Paragraph 15.01 (Force Majeure), the non- defaulting Party may give written notice of intent to terminate this Agreement, specifying the details of such default. Unless the defaulting Party has remedied such default within the Cure Period, this Agreement may be terminated, without penalty, payment or prejudice to claims then accrued, by written notice to the defaulting Party by the non-defaulting Party specifying the date of termination which will be of immediate effect. In the event of termination under this Paragraph 12.03 where FCE is the defaulting Party, FCEs royalty-free licenses described in Paragraph 7.01(b)(1), 8.02(b)(1)(i), 8.02 (b)(1)(ii), 8.02(b)(1)(iii), and 8.02(b)(2)(i) will immediately convert to royalty-bearing licenses, with the royalty rate to be negotiated by the Parties in good faith.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the consequences of failing to perform material obligations. It states that if FCE defaults, its royalty-free licenses will convert to royalty-bearing licenses. This implies that ExxonMobil's licenses would not be similarly affected if ExxonMobil were the defaulting party, creating an imbalance in the consequences of default depending on which party is at fault.",

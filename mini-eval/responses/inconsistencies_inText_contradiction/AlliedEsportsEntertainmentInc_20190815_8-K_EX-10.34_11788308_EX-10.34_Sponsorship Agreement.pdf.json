        "section": "Any value-added, goods and services, or similar tax or duty imposed by any government or tax authority on any Sponsorship Benefit shall be borne solely by Allied. Newegg has 60 days from the invoice date to remit payment.",
        "explanation": "This section places the burden of taxes and duties on Allied but then grants Newegg a 60-day payment window. This could be interpreted as Allied bearing the financial burden while Newegg benefits from a lengthy payment term, potentially creating an imbalance in obligations. There isn't necessarily a direct contradiction, but the juxtaposition of these two clauses could lead to disputes about fairness and the overall value of the sponsorship.",

        "section": "Before any Party (the Complaining Party) may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the Non Complaining Party), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Partys complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrators award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "This section mandates both a 30-day good faith negotiation period and arbitration for disputes. However, it also states that the section doesn't preclude or place conditions on seeking injunctive relief. Injunctive relief is typically sought from a court, and the clause suggests it can be pursued immediately, even before the 30-day negotiation or arbitration. This creates a potential conflict: Must a party engage in negotiation/arbitration before seeking injunctive relief, or can injunctive relief be sought immediately, bypassing those steps?",

        "section": "Each Party may also terminate the Agreement for convenience after Contract Year 2 (as defined in Section 14.4) by providing written notice to the other Party at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the effective date of such termination",
        "explanation": "This clause grants both parties the right to terminate for convenience after Contract Year 2 with 60 days' notice. However, Section 14.4 outlines financial responsibilities of Newegg during the first two contract years if they default or breach the agreement. While not a direct contradiction, the ease with which both parties can terminate after Year 2 contrasts sharply with the stricter financial penalties imposed on Newegg for early termination due to default in the initial years. This could be viewed as an imbalance in the agreement, potentially favoring Allied after the first two years.",

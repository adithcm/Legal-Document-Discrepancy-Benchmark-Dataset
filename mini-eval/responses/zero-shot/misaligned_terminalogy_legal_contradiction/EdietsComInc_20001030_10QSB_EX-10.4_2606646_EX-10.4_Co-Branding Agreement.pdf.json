        "section": "Effective one week from the 1 Launch Date, eDiets shall include a back button to the Women.com Site on all pages of the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page. If at any time during the Term of this Agreement, eDiets reasonably believes that the inclusion of such back buttons has a material negative effect upon the rate at which users of the Diet Center register to become members of eDiets or convert into registered participants of the services offered by eDiets on the Diet Center (the \"Negative Effect\"), eDiets may conduct a one (1) month test of the effect of such back buttons which may include the exclusion of the back button. If such test verifies the Negative Effect of the back button(s) to the Women.com Site, eDiets may remove any such back buttons.",
        "explanation": "This section allows eDiets to remove back buttons if they negatively affect registration rates, but it's ambiguous how a 'material negative effect' is defined and measured. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes.",

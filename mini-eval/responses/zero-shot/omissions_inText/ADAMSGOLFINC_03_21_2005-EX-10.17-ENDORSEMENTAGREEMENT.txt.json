        "explanation": "The contract states that the term begins on September 1, 2004, and lasts for a specified number of years and months, but the exact termination date is redacted. This omission creates ambiguity regarding the contract's duration and the parties' obligations.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause discusses termination due to the consultant's death or inability to play, requiring repayment for the unperformed period, calculated as per paragraph 8A. However, paragraph 8A outlines a repayment schedule for failing to meet a minimum number of tournaments, not for complete inability to perform. This creates an inconsistency in how the repayment is calculated in the event of death or complete inability to play.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The text requires the CONSULTANT to achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum number of events but does not define what a 'satisfactory record of play' entails. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine whether the consultant has met their obligations, potentially leading to disputes over the repayment clause.",

The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a complex exception to the exclusivity clause (Section 4A, 4B, and 4C) allowing the consultant to endorse and play a competing product ([*****]). However, the redactions throughout the paragraph make it impossible to fully understand the scope and limitations of this exception. The redacted portions obscure key details such as the specific type of product, the nature of the permitted advertising, and the remedies for deviations from past practices. This lack of clarity creates ambiguity and potential for dispute regarding the consultant's endorsement rights and obligations.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "The term 'satisfactory record of play' is not defined, leading to potential disputes. What constitutes a 'satisfactory record' is subjective and open to interpretation. The amount of events that need to be played is also redacted. Furthermore, the compensation is also redacted making it impossible to know the logistics of the contract.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the conditions for termination for cause by either party due to a material breach. However, it stipulates that upon termination, the CONSULTANT is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed portion of the agreement, calculated according to paragraph 8A. This is inconsistent with typical contract law, where termination for cause due to a breach by one party generally does not require the non-breaching party to compensate the breaching party. This creates an unfair burden on the Consultant if ADAMS GOLF were to breach the contract.",

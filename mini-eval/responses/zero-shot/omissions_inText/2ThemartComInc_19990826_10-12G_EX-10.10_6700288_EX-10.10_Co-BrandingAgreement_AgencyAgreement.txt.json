        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence of section 8.1 contradicts the earlier part of the section. It states that the agreement is automatically renewed for another year if neither party provides notice of non-renewal. However, the section also states that renewal requires mutual written agreement, which implies active consent, not automatic renewal.",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a legal contradiction. The first part says that California Escrow Law will prevail in case of a conflict. However, the last sentence says that in case i-Escrow believes there is a conflict, both parties will try to resolve it. This contradicts the initial statement that the law will prevail and creates ambiguity as to which standard will be followed.",

        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a conditional termination right based on the 'Launch Date' not occurring within 4 months of the 'Effective Date'. However, it also adds a caveat that only the party that used 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' can exercise this termination right. This creates ambiguity because it does not specify how 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' will be determined or who makes that determination. This could lead to disputes if one party claims the other did not act in good faith and attempts to prevent termination.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding renewal. It states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement' but then immediately states that the agreement 'shall be automatically renewed' if no notice is given. These are contradictory because an automatic renewal does not require mutual agreement.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of this section limits indemnity to situations where the Indemnified Party is 'deemed a principal' of the Indemnifying Party. This appears to be contradictory to the sentences that follow that specifically address indemnity for claims arising from 2TheMart Content and i-Escrow content. This is because it is not clear whether the 'deemed a principal' clause applies to the subsequent clauses.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph discusses responsibility for expedited shipping costs based on the delivery deadline requested in the Purchase Order. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, Accuray bears the expedited costs. However, the examples provided contradict this rule. In the first example, a Purchase Order submitted on June 1 with a delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months later) has expedited costs borne by Accuray. In the second example, a Purchase Order submitted on June 1 with a delivery date of October 1 (less than six months later) has expedited costs borne by the Distributor. The contradiction is that the initial statement implies 'at least six months' means *more* than six months for Accuray to bear costs, but the example uses exactly six months. This creates an inconsistency.",

        "explanation": "Section 5.4.1.2.1 states that a US $100,000 payment is due upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date. However, Section 2.4 states Accuray's standard lead time for delivery of Products is six months. If the lead time is six months, it is not possible for the payment to be made four months prior to shipment. This creates an inconsistency in the text.",

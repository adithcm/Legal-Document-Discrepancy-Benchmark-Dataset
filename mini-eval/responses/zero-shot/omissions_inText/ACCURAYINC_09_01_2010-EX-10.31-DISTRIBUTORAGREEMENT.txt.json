        "explanation": "This definition is overly simplistic and lacks specific details. It defines the term as simply \"a purchase,\" which is vague and does not provide any meaningful context or criteria for what constitutes a 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase'. This omission creates ambiguity regarding the scope and applicability of the agreement, leading to confusion about which transactions fall under this agreement.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray. The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address: Accuray Incorporated ATTN: Contracts Administration 1310 Chesapeake Terrace Sunnyvale, CA 94089 Main: (408) 716-4600 Fax: (408) 789-4205 Email: Orders@accuray.com 2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "In section 2.3.3, it states that failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. However, in section 2.3.4, it states that Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. These two sections are contradicting one another, since Accuray not approving or disapproving is still a form of disapproval.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The condition that Accuray bears expedited delivery costs only if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission creates a potential conflict. Accuray's standard lead time for delivery of Products is stated as six months in Section 2.4. If the standard lead time is already six months, it is unclear how expedited delivery could ever be required if the Purchase Order requests a delivery date exactly six months out, because that is already the standard. This section is ambiguous because it does not account for what happens when expedited delivery is requested on a delivery date longer than six months, or shorter than six months.",

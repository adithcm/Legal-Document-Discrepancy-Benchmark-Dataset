Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the Provider Representatives must be solely dedicated to providing services to the Recipient. However, Section 1.2(e) allows Provider to use subcontractors. If those subcontractors are not solely dedicated to the Recipient, this creates a contradiction, as those subcontractors would also be considered Provider Representatives.",

However, Section 3.2 allows either party to terminate the agreement at any time with 90 days written notice. The initial term ending on December 31, 2020 contradicts the open ended termination clause.",

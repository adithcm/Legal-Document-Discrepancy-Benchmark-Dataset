        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"as needed\" is vague and does not specify how the need for capital contributions is determined, by whom, or in what amount. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes between the Joint Venturers regarding when and how much capital each is required to contribute.",

        "explanation": "This statement grants each Joint Venturer the authority to execute any instrument, which could include contracts, loans, or other legally binding agreements. This very broad authority, without specifying limitations or requiring mutual consent for significant decisions, is a structural flaw, because it has the potential to expose the Joint Venture to undue risk if one venturer acts without the knowledge or agreement of the other.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers agree and declare that this association for the carrying on of a joint venture business operation does not, and is not intended to create a partnership, for either legal or United States income tax purposes, each Party recognizing that the other is willing and able to contribute capital, labor, and services for the operation of a successful joint venture business. Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",
        "explanation": "While the intent to elect out of partnership treatment under the Internal Revenue Code is stated, the agreement only specifies that the parties will execute and file documentation \"if necessary\". This creates ambiguity because it does not clearly define when such documentation is deemed necessary or who is responsible for determining that necessity. This is a structural flaw, as it does not fully explain how to handle the taxes.",

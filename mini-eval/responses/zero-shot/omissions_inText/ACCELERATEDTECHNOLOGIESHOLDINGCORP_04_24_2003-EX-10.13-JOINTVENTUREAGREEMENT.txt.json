        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it doesn't specify *how* the need for capital contributions is determined, *who* decides, or *what* happens if a Joint Venturer fails to contribute when requested. It creates uncertainty about the obligations of each party regarding capital contributions.",

Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",

It states that they agree the election should be manifested, but doesn't designate responsibility.",

For instance, what happens if one party cannot cover their share of the losses? This lack of detail introduces ambiguity and potential for dispute.",

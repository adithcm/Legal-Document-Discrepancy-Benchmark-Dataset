        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever practical. The decision on whether to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT in a specific tournament will be at the sole discretion of the CONSULTANT based on performance considerations. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "The section first states that the Consultant 'shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever practical.' However, it then states that the decision to use the MANDATORY product is at the sole discretion of the consultant. This creates ambiguity as to how the product is to be used. In addition, it further states that the Consultant can use non ADAMS GOLF clubs, as long as they don't endorse it.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "The initial clause requires the consultant to indemnify Adams Golf for all liabilities, claims, etc., but then it carves out an exception and states that Adams Golf will cover the consultant's attorney fees up to $10,000. This creates an inconsistency, because it is not clear what would happen if the attorney fees are higher than $10,000.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination for a material breach by either party, but then it only stipulates the consultant to pay back ADAMS GOLF if the contract is terminated. It does not state what happens if ADAMS GOLF is in material breach and the contract is terminated. It is an example of omission in text, which is also a structural flaw.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding the payment of attorney's fees in an indemnification clause. Initially, it states that CONSULTANT is responsible for indemnifying ADAMS GOLF from all damages and expenses, excluding attorney's fees. However, the subsequent sentence states that ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney's fees up to $10,000. This introduces a direct contradiction about who is responsible for attorney's fees, and to what extent.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the terms for termination due to the consultant's death or inability to play golf and states that upon such termination, the CONSULTANT or their estate is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed portion of the agreement, calculated according to paragraph 8A. The contradiction arises because paragraph 8A deals with the repayment of base compensation due to the consultant's failure to participate in a minimum number of tournaments, not death or inability to play. Applying that repayment schedule to a situation of death or permanent inability to play is illogical and creates an unenforcable repayment schedule.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section allows either party to terminate the agreement for a material breach, provided they give 15 days written notice and the breach is not rectified. If termination occurs, the consultant is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period of the agreement, calculated according to paragraph 8A. However, paragraph 8A deals with the repayment of base compensation due to the consultant's failure to participate in a minimum number of tournaments. Applying that repayment schedule to a termination for breach is illogical because it means that Adams Golf can be made whole for a breach caused by Adams Golf.",

        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the Provider's obligation to provide services. While the first sentence states that the Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth in Exhibit A, the subsequent sentence allows the Provider to refuse requests for additional services not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, even if they are necessary for the Recipient's operation, based on the Provider's discretion. This contradicts the initial agreement to provide all services outlined in Exhibit A, as it gives the Provider an out based on their subjective assessment of feasibility.",

        "explanation": "There is a structural flaw in this section that makes it difficult to read and understand. The phrase \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and\" is redundant and grammatically incorrect. It is a poorly written sentence. It needs to be restructured to make sense.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the terms of payment and related matters. However, Section 3.6 (e) states: On a pro rata basis, repay all fees and expenses paid in advance for any Services which have not been provided. Both of these statements contradict each other. Section 3.5 says that Section 2.2 survives the termination of the contract. Section 3.6 says that any fees or expenses that have been paid in advance should be paid back.",

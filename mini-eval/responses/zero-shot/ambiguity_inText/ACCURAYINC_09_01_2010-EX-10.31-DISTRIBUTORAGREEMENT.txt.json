        "explanation": "The section states that Accuray will defend or settle, indemnify and hold Accuray harmless. You can't hold yourself harmless, you can only hold another party harmless.",

        "section": "Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "The section contradicts itself, because, if the distributor is a business person, then they are only late if they fail to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due. However, the prior sentence states that Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law.",

This is Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective software. By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Bug Fixes available to Customer, and Accuray shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or implementation of such Bug Fixes at the Customer's site.",
        "explanation": "This section appears to limit Accuray's obligation to providing bug fixes but disclaims any obligation for installation or implementation unless otherwise agreed. However, depending on the nature of the bug fix, merely providing the fix without installation might render it useless, essentially negating the intended benefit of the warranty.",

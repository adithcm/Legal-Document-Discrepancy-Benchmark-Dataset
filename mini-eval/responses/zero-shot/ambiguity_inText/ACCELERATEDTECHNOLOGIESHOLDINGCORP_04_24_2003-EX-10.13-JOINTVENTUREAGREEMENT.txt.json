        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, it doesn't specify what happens if capital contributions are needed but one party doesn't consent. It's ambiguous as to how the Joint Venture would proceed with funding in such a scenario, especially if the venture requires initial capital to function.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the procedure for termination and liquidation. It states that unexpended funds are distributed proportionally, but then says that 'all other assets' are distributed at the discretion of a third-party mediator 'irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.' This is a contradiction because the initial pro rata ownership is disregarded for asset distribution, giving full control to a 3rd party that may not be in the best interest of the venturers.",

        "explanation": "The end date of the joint venture is February 28, 2004, but it says it can be extended by 'either' joint venturer providing notice. For such an important decision, 'either' joint venturer should not have the power to extend the contract, and both venturers must agree upon extending the contract. Otherwise, there are no parameters around extending the contract and it can lead to legal issues.",

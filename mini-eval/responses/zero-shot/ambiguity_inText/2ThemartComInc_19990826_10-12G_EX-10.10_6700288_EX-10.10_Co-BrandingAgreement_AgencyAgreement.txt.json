        "section": "CUSTOMERS means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "This definition is ambiguous. It's unclear whether 'at least one transaction per month' refers to each individual user completing one transaction monthly to be continuously considered a 'Customer,' or if it refers to the Co-Branded Site collectively achieving at least one transaction involving any users. This ambiguity affects payment calculations and obligations linked to 'Customers.'",

        "explanation": "This statement implies that the agreement requires an active renewal by one party to be valid. This contradicts the previous statements in the same section, which imply the agreement needs to be renewed by mutual written agreement.",

        "explanation": "The section is structurally flawed because it is incomplete. It starts like a list of requirements, but it doesn't finish the statement properly. This section attempts to define when a notice is officially considered 'given,' but the lack of clarity leaves the reader without a full understanding of the rule.",

        "section": "6.7 SERVICE STANDARDS. i-Escrow will comply with all laws and regulations and act as an Independent Escrow Agent as per the guidelines of California Escrow Law (California Financial Code Section17000 et seq., or its successor). Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines that California Escrow Law will prevail if there is a conflict. However, it later states that i-Escrow only needs to notify 2TheMart of the conflict and use \"best efforts\" to resolve it. This is contradictory because the law should prevail regardless of whether the conflict is resolved or not, which makes the resolution process ambiguous.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph repeats the sentence, 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.' This repetition is a structural flaw and doesn't add any value to the sentence.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "The termination clause allows for immediate termination for breach under specific conditions (failure to cure breach within 60 days), but also allows for immediate termination as provided in sections 2.2, 2.4, or 12.4. The wording implies that termination under these sections is also considered a breach. This is a structural flaw because Section 2.2 and 12.4 outline conditions that either party can terminate the agreement, not just the non-breaching party.",

        "section": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall aim to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (MAOV) of [***] (Units) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV may be [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, subject to commercial aseptic production at Heritages [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019.",
        "explanation": "The wording regarding the MAOV after July 1, 2019 is ambiguous. It states the MAOV 'may be' a certain number, but doesn't clearly define the conditions under which this change occurs or whether Premier has an obligation to purchase at that level. The phrase 'subject to commercial aseptic production...and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019' creates uncertainty. Does the MAOV remain the original amount if the facility isn't approved or if aseptic production isn't achieved?",

        "explanation": "The term 'likely purchase' introduces ambiguity. Legal agreements should use definitive language, especially regarding purchase obligations. 'Likely' does not create a binding obligation and could be interpreted in multiple ways. This is especially relevant since the MAOV is a key component of the agreement.",

        "section": "This agreement shall begin upon the date of its execution by MA and acceptance in writing by Company and shall remain in effect until the end of the current calendar year and shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods unless otherwise terminated according to the cancellation or termination provisions contained in paragraph 18 of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The agreement's term extends to the 'end of the current calendar year' and automatically renews for one-year periods unless terminated per paragraph 18. However, the agreement is dated May 8, 2014, and lacks specificity regarding the 'current calendar year' for initial term calculation. If executed, for example, in November 2014, the initial term is very short. This could lead to disputes regarding the intended duration and renewal terms, particularly if execution occurs late in the year.",

        "explanation": "This section places a broad obligation on the MA to protect the Company's intellectual property. However, it doesn't define the scope of 'cooperate fully'. This is ambiguous. Without clear boundaries, the MA's required actions could become excessively burdensome or costly, leading to disputes about the extent of their responsibility. It also doesn't define what an 'infringement' would be, which makes it hard to define.",

This Agreement is accepted by Company in the State of Nevada and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws thereof, which laws shall prevail in the event of any conflict. For such limited purpose, MA hereby consents to the personal jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Nevada.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states that it is governed by the laws of Nevada and that the MA consents to the jurisdiction of Nevada courts 'for such limited purpose'. However, it doesn't specify what this 'limited purpose' is. This creates ambiguity about the scope of the jurisdiction clause. Does it apply to all disputes under the agreement, or only specific types of claims? This uncertainty could lead to challenges to jurisdiction if a dispute arises.",

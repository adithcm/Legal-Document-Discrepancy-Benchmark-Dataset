        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the general purpose of an affiliate program, which is to incentivize third parties to promote products or services to *others*, not to personally benefit from the program by applying for credit cards themselves. This creates an ambiguity as to whether affiliates are allowed to exploit the program for personal gain.",

This creates ambiguity as to whether affiliates are allowed to select or remove links.",

Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written or e-mail notice of termination. At the time of termination, any links to Chases Website must be removed immediately. Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement *only if the affiliate remains in good standing and actively promotes Chase products in accordance with Chase's evolving marketing strategies.*",
        "explanation": "The clause '*only if the affiliate remains in good standing and actively promotes Chase products in accordance with Chase's evolving marketing strategies*' adds an unclear condition to the affiliate's right to receive commission payments for approved accounts after termination.  The terms 'good standing' and 'actively promotes Chase products in accordance with Chase's evolving marketing strategies' are vague and open to interpretation, especially after the agreement has been terminated.  It's unclear what actions constitute 'actively promoting' after termination, and how Chase determines 'good standing' once the agreement is no longer in effect.",

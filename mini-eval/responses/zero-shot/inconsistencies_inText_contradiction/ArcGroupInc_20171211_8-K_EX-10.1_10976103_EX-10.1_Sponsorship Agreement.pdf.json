        "section": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each due on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sponsor shall have until December 15th of each applicable contract year to make the final payment without penalty.",
        "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. Section 3(a) states that all installments are due by November 1st, but the added sentence allows the final payment to be made as late as December 15th without penalty. This creates ambiguity as to the actual deadline for the final installment and whether late fees would apply between November 2nd and December 15th.",

If any portion of the Annual Trade Value is not used at the end of the Term, Club shall be permitted to use such unused amount within twelve (12) months following expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "There's an inconsistency in how the unused Annual Trade Value is handled. Initially, it rolls over to the next year. However, at the end of the term, the Club gets to use the remaining amount for 12 months. It is not clarified whether the sponsor gets compensated for it or not.",

        "explanation": "The use of 'shall' in the invoice clause creates an ambiguity. While it mandates the sponsor to pay within 30 days of receiving the invoice, the use of the word 'shall' creates confusion as it creates ambiguity within the context of the sentence. The invoice should be sent to the sponsor at a certain date and time.",

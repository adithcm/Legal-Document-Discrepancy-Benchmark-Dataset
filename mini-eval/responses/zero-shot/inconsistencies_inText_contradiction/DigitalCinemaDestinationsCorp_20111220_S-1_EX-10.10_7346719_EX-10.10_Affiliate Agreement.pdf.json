        "section": "Section 2.3 Ownership of small d Equipment. NCM will own the small d Equipment it has purchased pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (the NCM Equipment). NCM shall depreciate the cost of the NCM Equipment on a calendar quarterly basis, provided that the method used will result in full depreciation at the end of the five-year period commencing on the Effective Date. Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason, Network Affiliate shall pay NCM the value of the NCM Equipment, if any, that remains on NCMs financial statements as of the time of such expiration or termination. Upon payment of such amount to NCM by Network Affiliate at the time of such expiration or termination, NCMs ownership interest in the NCM Equipment will transfer to Network Affiliate.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the depreciation of the 'small d Equipment' over a five-year period and the transfer of ownership to Network Affiliate upon termination, provided Network Affiliate pays the remaining depreciated value. However, it doesn't explicitly address what happens if the agreement terminates before the end of the five-year depreciation period. This omission creates ambiguity regarding the ownership and financial responsibilities if termination occurs early.",

        "explanation": "The definition of Policy Trailer is ambiguous. It states that with prior written approval of Network Affiliate, other promotional materials of third-party products for which NCM sells advertising and is paid a fee (the Policy Trailer). But it can't be the Policy Trailer if third-party products are advertised. Therefore, it is ambiguous.",

Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all amounts due by one Party to the other under this Agreement, less any permitted deductions, shall be paid in full within thirty (30) days after the fiscal month in which such amounts were received by the paying Party, or the receipt by the paying Party of an invoice therefore, as applicable. However, if the paying party deems the invoice to be inaccurate, payment can be withheld for up to ninety (90) days pending resolution of the dispute.",
        "explanation": "The payment terms are somewhat contradictory. The initial statement requires payment within thirty days of receiving funds or an invoice. However, the subsequent clause allows for withholding payment for up to ninety days if the invoice is disputed. This creates ambiguity around the actual payment deadline and the conditions under which payments can be delayed.",

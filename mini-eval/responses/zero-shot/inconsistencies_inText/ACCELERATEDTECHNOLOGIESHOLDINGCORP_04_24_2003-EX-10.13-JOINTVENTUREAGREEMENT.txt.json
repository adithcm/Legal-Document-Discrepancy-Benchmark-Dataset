However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days. This creates a contradiction because the agreement is only for one year, but either joint venturer can terminate the agreement with 60 days written notice. Meaning that a joint venturer can terminate the agreement before the agreement even begins.",

However, it then states that PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability. This contradicts the previous statement, as it mandates a payment to PVSS even if the Joint Venture is not profitable and its assets are not in excess of liabilities.",

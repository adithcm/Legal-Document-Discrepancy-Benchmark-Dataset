        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, Section 9 states that 'No Joint Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any part of his capital contribution or account...'. If there is no capital contribution requirement, how can a joint venturer withdraw from a capital contribution?",

The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination. However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "This section sets the term of the joint venture as starting March 1, 2003, and ending February 28, 2004, unless extended. It also allows either party to unilaterally terminate the agreement with 60 days' notice. However, the initial term is less than 60 days before the scheduled termination date, which means that once the agreement is in place, neither party would be able to pull out of the agreement.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "Section 9 discusses distributions of gross income to the joint venturers, contingent upon the joint venture's assets exceeding its liabilities after the distribution. The statement in the final sentence contradicts the initial conditions for distribution, stating that PVSS receives $10,000 per month irrespective of profitability or asset/liability balance. This creates ambiguity about the actual conditions for PVSS to receive payments.",

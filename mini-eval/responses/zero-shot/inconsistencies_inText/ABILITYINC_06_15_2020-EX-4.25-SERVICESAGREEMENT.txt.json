        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that Provider Representatives (employees or contractors) must solely provide services to the Recipient. However, Section 1.1(a) allows the Provider to respond to reasonable requests by Recipient for additional services not currently contemplated in Exhibit A.  If these additional services require the Provider Representatives to perform tasks that could arguably benefit the Provider (even indirectly), it creates a potential conflict with the dedication clause.",

        "explanation": "This section specifies that the laws of the State of Israel govern the agreement. However, the Recipient is defined as \"TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD., a company organized and existing under the laws of Singapore and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd, a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel\". Given that one of the Recipient entities is based in Singapore, applying only Israeli law could be problematic. Singaporean law might have relevance, especially if disputes arise specific to the Singaporean entity. This creates ambiguity as to which jurisdiction's laws take precedence.",

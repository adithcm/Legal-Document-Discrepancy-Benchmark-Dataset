        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction within this section. It states that if the consultant is unable to play due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. However, the section then goes on to say that upon termination, the consultant and/or consultant's estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by the consultant. This contradicts the statement that no repayment shall be required if the failure to play is due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event.",

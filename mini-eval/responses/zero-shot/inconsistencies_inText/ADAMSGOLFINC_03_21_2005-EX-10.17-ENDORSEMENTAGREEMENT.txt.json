        "explanation": "Section 4 explicitly prohibits CONSULTANT from endorsing products from other manufacturers, but then introduces an exception allowing endorsement of [*****], under certain conditions related to past practices. The redactions make it impossible to determine the scope and limitations of this exception, creating ambiguity. It is unclear what actions CONSULTANT must take to 'remedy the situation' if the endorsement deviates from past practice. It is also unclear what the terms and conditions would be if the consultant replaces the endorsement with another one.",

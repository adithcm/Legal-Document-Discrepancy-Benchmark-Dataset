        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that Accuray must either accept or reject a Purchase Order within two weeks of reciept. The second sentence states that each purchase may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This is a contradiction as the first sentence implies that the purchase order is only valid if Accuray accepts it. This is contradictory as the second sentence says that the purchase order is only valid if it is executed. Both terms cannot exist at the same time, since they contradict each other.",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the responsibility for expedited shipping costs when meeting delivery deadlines. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission, Accuray bears the expedited costs. However, the subsequent example provides contradictory scenarios. It says that if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor. The first example states that Accuray is responsible for expedited delivery expenses if the Purchase Order was submitted on June 1st and requested delivery date is December 1, which matches the initial statement. However, the second example states that if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor, which does not match the first statement.",

        "explanation": "The section provides one payment term, stating that the payment is due 60 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified location. However, the section fails to provide clarity on what would happen if the delivery date is delayed or whether that would affect the 60 days from delivery term. Therefore, the section is ambiguous because it is not clear on what will happen if the delivery date is changed.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the rate without i-Escrow's consent creates a significant imbalance of power and uncertainty in the financial obligations. This could be deemed unconscionable or lacking in good faith, particularly if the adjusted rate is unreasonable or detrimental to i-Escrow. The lack of a mechanism for i-Escrow to negotiate or dispute the Adjusted Rate is a major point of concern.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The clause states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, which is standard. However, it then adds a contradictory statement that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days prior to expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. This contradicts the 'mutual written agreement' requirement and creates ambiguity. Does it require both parties to agree in writing, or does a lack of explicit non-renewal serve as implicit consent?",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph creates a contradiction. It initially states that Section 8.5 does not survive expiration or termination of the agreement, but then in the following sentance it states that all provisions of this agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. This is a direct contradiction. ",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It states that the agreement may be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then also states that the term shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year if neither party gives notice of non-renewal. These two statements contradict each other, as one implies active agreement is needed, and the other implies automatic renewal unless action is taken.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The fact that 2TheMart can unilaterally change the advertising fees without i-Escrow's consent is a discrepancy. A contract implies a mutual agreement of terms. The ability for one party to unilaterally change a key financial term raises concerns about fairness and potentially violates principles of good faith negotiation and fair dealing, depending on applicable state laws regarding contractual obligations.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party\" introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction. Indemnification usually arises from the actions of the indemnifying party, not based on a principal-agent relationship. If the Indemnified Party needs to be deemed a principal, it is ambigious to what that means.",

        "section": "This agreement shall begin upon the date of its execution by MA and acceptance in writing by Company and shall remain in effect until the end of the current calendar year and shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods unless otherwise terminated according to the cancellation or termination provisions contained in paragraph 18 of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The effective date is tied to execution and acceptance, but the term ends at the end of the calendar year, leading to a potentially very short initial term. This is inconsistent and ambiguous because it doesn't specify what happens if the agreement is executed very late in the calendar year.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the service fee is paid quarterly, however, also states that it is for each month that MA has no sales pursuant to this Schedule A. This is a contradiction, as it can be interpreted that it is to be paid quarterly and monthly.",

All other prices and/or fees may be adjusted without prior notice to MA.",

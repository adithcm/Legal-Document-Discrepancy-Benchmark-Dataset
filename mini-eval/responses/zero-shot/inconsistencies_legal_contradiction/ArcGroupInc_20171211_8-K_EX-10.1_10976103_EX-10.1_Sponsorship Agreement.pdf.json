        "section": "The term of this Agreement (the Term) shall commence as of April 1, 2018 (the Effective Date) and shall expire upon the later of: (a) the conclusion of the 2022/23 NFL season and (b) the last day in February, 2023 (such expiration date, the Scheduled Expiration Date), unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The expiration date is ambiguous. The 2022/2023 NFL season concludes in February 2023. Therefore, stating the agreement expires at the end of the 2022/2023 NFL season AND the last day in February 2023 is redundant. Also, the agreement may be terminated sooner than the expiration date.",

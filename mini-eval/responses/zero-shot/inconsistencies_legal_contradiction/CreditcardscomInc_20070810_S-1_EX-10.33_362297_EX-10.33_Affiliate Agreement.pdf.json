        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the implied intent of an affiliate program, which is to generate referrals and earn commissions from third-party customers, not for personal use. While not explicitly prohibited elsewhere, this statement deviates from the common understanding and purpose of affiliate marketing, creating a potential contradiction in the overall understanding of the agreement's purpose.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website.",
        "explanation": "This gives Chase the right to change any term without directly notifying the affiliate. The affiliate has to constantly check for an updated agreement in order to be up to date on the agreement. This is a structural flaw in the text because it places an unreasonable burden on the affiliate to monitor changes to the agreement, potentially leading to unintentional breaches due to unawareness of modified terms.",

        "explanation": "The sentence says that the affiliate may remove links at anytime without prior approval from Chase, but in the second part of the sentence, it says that the affiliate is also responsible for informing chase of potential inactive or misdirected links. This is a contradiction because if they can remove links at anytime, they do not need to report it to Chase.",

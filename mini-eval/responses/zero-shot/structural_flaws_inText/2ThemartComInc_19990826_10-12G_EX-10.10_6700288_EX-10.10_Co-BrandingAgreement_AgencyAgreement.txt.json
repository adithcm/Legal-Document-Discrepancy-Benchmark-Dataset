        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "The clause states that the advertising fees will consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion, and that the formula for calculating this amount may be revised at i-Escrow's discretion, and i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent. This gives i-Escrow the unilateral right to determine and change the payment amount, effectively meaning 2TheMart has no control over the compensation they receive. This is a misaligment in text.",

        "explanation": "This statement is contradictory. The first part states that each party must keep the other's information confidential, but the second part immediately allows either party to disclose the other's confidential information to any third party at any time. This completely negates the confidentiality requirement, creating an in-text contradiction.",

Once every twelve (12) months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports.",
        "explanation": "The language regarding the audit rights is structurally flawed and could be confusing. It states that i-Escrow shall keep records for one year, and then that 2TheMart may audit the records 'once every twelve (12) months'. This could be interpreted as 2TheMart only having one chance to audit the records during the entire agreement, instead of annually. Because of this, it is a structural flaw.",

        "section": "For the avoidance of doubt, 'Accuray Regions' shall only refer to North America.",
        "explanation": "Section 1.1 defines 'Accuray Regions' as the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, including Australia and other than India and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan. However, the subsequent sentence restricts the definition to only North America. This creates an ambiguity as to which regions are actually considered 'Accuray Regions' for the purposes of the agreement, leading to potential confusion and disputes.",

        "section": "However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",
        "explanation": "Section 4.6.1 initially defines a limited warranty period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment. The subsequent sentence introduces a contradictory statement, warranting that the system will be free from any defects for the 'expected lifetime of the product.' This later statement significantly broadens the warranty beyond the explicitly defined Warranty Period, creating ambiguity and a conflict between the limited and unlimited warranty terms.",

        "section": "The letter of credit will provide that Accuray can draw against the letter of credit according to the following schedule:\n5.4.1.1.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and\n5.4.1.1.2. Balance upon presentation of documents by Accuray evidencing shipment of the Products to Distributor or Customer as designated in the Purchase Order.",
        "explanation": "The clause regarding the $100,000 non-refundable payment creates a contradiction. While it is stated to be non-refundable, it will automatically be applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System. This implies that it is, in effect, refundable under certain conditions (future purchase), contradicting the initial statement of non-refundability.",

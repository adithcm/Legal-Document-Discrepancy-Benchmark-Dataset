        "section": "For the entire term of this Agreement, from September 1, 2004 through [*****] ADAMS GOLF *intends* to pay CONSULTANT a base compensation of [*****] dollars. Payment of the base compensation will be subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value.",
        "explanation": "The use of the word \"intends\" weakens the obligation of ADAMS GOLF to pay the base compensation. Further, making the payment subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value creates ambiguity and could allow ADAMS GOLF to avoid paying the base compensation even if CONSULTANT fully performs their obligations. This contradicts the fundamental purpose of the agreement, which is to compensate CONSULTANT for their endorsement.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction because it requires the consultant or their estate to repay ADAMS GOLF for the period of the agreement not performed if the consultant dies. This is contradictory to standard legal practices, as the consultant's death would be considered an unforeseen circumstance, and repayment of all compensation might not be equitable or enforceable.",

In the event of termination of this Agreement, ADAMS GOLF shall cease using the name and/or likeness of CONSULTANT on Product within [*****] months after termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This creates an inconsistency because the contract does not define what the difference is between the use of likeness in advertising and the use of likeness on a product. If this is not properly defined, it is unclear as to what actions are prohibited in the days following termination versus the months following termination.",

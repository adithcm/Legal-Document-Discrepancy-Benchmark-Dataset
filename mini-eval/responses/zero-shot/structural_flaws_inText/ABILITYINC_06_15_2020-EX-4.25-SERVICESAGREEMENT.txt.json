However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency in text. It states that either party can terminate the agreement at any time without cause, but then it imposes a termination fee and a 90-day prior written notice requirement. These conditions contradict the 'at any time without cause' clause, creating ambiguity around the actual termination process.",

        "explanation": "This creates an ambiguity in legal terms. Under common legal standards, receipt of notice is typically required for it to be effective. Stating that a notice is deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt, could lead to disputes and potential unenforceability under standard legal practices. This contradicts standard legal practice that requires proof of receipt.",

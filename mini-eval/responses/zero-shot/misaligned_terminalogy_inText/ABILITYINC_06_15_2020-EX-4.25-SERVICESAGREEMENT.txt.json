        "explanation": "There is a structural flaw in the text, where it states 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement', which does not make sense. It should be reworded to be 'This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date'.",

Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that the names, positions, experience, and licenses of the employees performing services are listed in Exhibit A. However, the last sentence then dictates that these employees are dedicated solely to the Recipient and cannot provide services to Provider or other customers. This creates an inconsistency, as if they are *employees or contractors to perform the Services*, as stated in the first sentence, they should be able to provide services for the Provider as well.",

        "explanation": "This clause is overly broad and may be unenforceable. It assigns all rights to any invention etc. 'suggested by' or 'results from' the Services. This is very ambiguous and could be interpreted to include inventions created outside of work hours or tangentially related to the services, raising enforceability issues.",

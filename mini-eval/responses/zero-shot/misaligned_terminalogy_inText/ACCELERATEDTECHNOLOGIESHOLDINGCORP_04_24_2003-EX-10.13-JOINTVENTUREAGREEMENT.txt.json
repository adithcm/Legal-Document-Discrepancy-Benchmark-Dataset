        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Participant shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Investor shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "The terms 'Joint Venturers,' 'Participant,' and 'Investor' are used interchangeably without clear definition. It's not explicitly stated whether 'Participant' and 'Investor' are synonymous with 'Joint Venturer.' This could lead to confusion regarding who is entitled to reimbursement of expenses, especially if one party acts in multiple capacities or if there's a dispute over whether a specific activity falls under the scope of 'services rendered to the Joint Venture.'",

The fiscal year of the Joint Venture shall be the calendar year, and shall use the cash basis of accounting. If requested by a Stockholder, the Joint Venture books and records shall be audited as of the close of each year by an independent accountant acceptable to both Joint Venturers.",
        "explanation": "This section contains misaligned terminology. The terms 'Partnership,' 'Syndicate,' 'Owner,' and 'Stockholder' are used within a Joint Venture agreement. These terms have specific legal meanings and should not be used interchangeably or without clear definitions, as they may cause confusion about the Joint Venture's structure and the parties involved. Especially since section 1 states that the associates are business associates, and not partners.",

        "explanation": "This section is missing a key contractual clause that is necessary for the termination of a legal joint venture. By omitting the procedure for termination, this can create an internal contradiction and cause conflict with the termination of the joint venture, since not all liabilities and parameters are defined.",

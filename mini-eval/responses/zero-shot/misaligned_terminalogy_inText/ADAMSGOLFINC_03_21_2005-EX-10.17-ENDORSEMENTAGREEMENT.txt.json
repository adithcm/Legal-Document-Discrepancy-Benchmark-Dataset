        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "The section states that the Consultant must exclusively use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, but then immediately contradicts itself by stating the Consultant can use other clubs, including a putter, from other manufacturers as long as they do not endorse them. This creates an ambiguity as to what 'exclusively play/use' truly means.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The first sentence establishes a requirement for a 'satisfactory record of play' in a minimum number of events, but it does not define what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play'. This lack of definition creates ambiguity. The subsequent sentence then details the repayment schedule if the consultant plays in less than a certain number of events, but this is still different from the satisfactory record of play.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.\n\n23. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE\n\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "These two sections explain the process and what happens if the contract is terminated. However, both are missing a section explaining what would happen if ADAMS GOLF were to breach the contract or dies/unable to perform. This causes a discrepancy in the contract.",

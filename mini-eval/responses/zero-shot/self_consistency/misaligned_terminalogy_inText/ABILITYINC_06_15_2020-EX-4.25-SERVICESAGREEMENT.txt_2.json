        "explanation": "The Recitals section uses both 'Vendor' and 'Provider' to refer to the same entity, but the document defines only 'Provider'.  This creates confusion as to whether 'Vendor' is a distinct entity or simply an interchangeable term, leading to a potential misalignment.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the terms of payment, specifying how the Recipient will compensate the Provider for services rendered. If the agreement terminates, it's unclear how these payments will be made. Because Section 2.2 survives the termination of the agreement, it means that both parties still need to follow the payment guidelines even after the agreement is terminated. It is not clear what type of payments are being made. This creates an ambiguity.",

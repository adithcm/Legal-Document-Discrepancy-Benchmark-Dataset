Neither Participant shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Investor shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "The section uses 'Joint Venturers', 'Participant', and 'Investor' interchangeably. While it's implied they all refer to CCGI and PVSS, the lack of clear definition creates potential ambiguity. The first sentence refers to 'Joint Venturers,' the second to 'Participant,' and the third to 'Investor.'",

        "explanation": "This section contains several misalignments.  It refers to 'Goods', 'Partnership', 'Syndicate', and 'Owner' without defining these terms within the context of the Joint Venture Agreement. The agreement defines the business as involving 'Products,' not 'Goods.'  The Joint Venture is explicitly stated *not* to be a partnership in Section 10, and these terms are not used anywhere else in the document. This creates confusion regarding which costs are actually covered and to what business structure these terms refer.",

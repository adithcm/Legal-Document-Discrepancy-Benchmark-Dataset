        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting information regarding renewal. It states that renewal requires mutual written agreement, but then says the agreement automatically renews if notice is not given. This creates ambiguity about the actual renewal process.",

Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow",
        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting language regarding the conditions for indemnification. It initially states the Protected Party must be 'considered a key agent of the Guarantor', then proceeds to describe separate indemnification obligations without mentioning the 'key agent' condition. This creates ambiguity as to whether the key agent provision applies to all indemnification scenarios or only the first sentence.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "The language regarding immediate termination is contradictory. It states that termination can occur immediately for a material breach if not cured within 60 days, which is not immediate. This presents an inconsistency between the claim of immediate termination and the 60-day cure period.",

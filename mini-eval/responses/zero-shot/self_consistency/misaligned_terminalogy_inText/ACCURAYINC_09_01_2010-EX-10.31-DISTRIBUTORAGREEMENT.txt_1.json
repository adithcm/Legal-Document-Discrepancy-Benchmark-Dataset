        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray. 2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.3.3 states that failure to approve or disapprove a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval, while Section 2.3.4 allows the Distributor to cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed it within two weeks of receipt. \"Execution\" and \"Approval/Disapproval\" are two different things. Accuray may approve/disapprove but not execute or Accuray may execute without approving/disapproving. This could lead to confusion and disputes.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section on shipment costs introduces a degree of ambiguity. The contract states that Accuray bears the cost of expedited delivery if the requested delivery date is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, it does not explicitly address who bears the cost if the expedited delivery is due to Accuray's delay in fulfilling the order, even when the requested delivery date is more than six months out. This omission creates a potential dispute point regarding responsibility for expedited shipping costs.",

        "section": "6.1. Term. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Accuray and Distributor and subject to the termination rights contained in this Agreement, this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue until the termination of the Strategic Alliance Agreement; provided, however, that if a Termination Election relating to this Agreement is made pursuant to Section 10.3 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement prior to such termination, this Agreement shall terminate 36 months after such Termination Election (the \"Term\").",
        "explanation": "The agreement term is dependent on the Strategic Alliance Agreement but also has a separate condition related to a Termination Election. This dual condition creates potential ambiguity. It is unclear if the 36-month period after a Termination Election is absolute, or if the agreement terminates sooner if the Strategic Alliance Agreement ends before those 36 months are up. This ambiguity could lead to disputes regarding the actual duration of the agreement.",

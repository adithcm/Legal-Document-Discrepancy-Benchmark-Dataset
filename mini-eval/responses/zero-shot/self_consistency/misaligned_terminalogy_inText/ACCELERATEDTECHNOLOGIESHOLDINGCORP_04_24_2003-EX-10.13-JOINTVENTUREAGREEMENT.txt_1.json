        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. This seems to contradict the general principle of a joint venture where partners typically contribute capital to start and sustain the business.",

        "explanation": "The term \"Founders\" is used here, but the agreement defines the parties as \"Joint Venturers\" or the \"Entity.\" This misalignment of terminology creates confusion and potential ambiguity as to who is responsible for maintaining the books and records.",

        "explanation": "The term of the Joint Venture is explicitly defined. The absence of any clauses addressing renewal, wind-down procedures post-termination, or the handling of existing obligations beyond this date creates a structural flaw.",

        "explanation": "While seemingly straightforward, the lack of clear definitions for \"professional golfer\" and \"ADAMS GOLF, LTD.\" could introduce ambiguity. For instance, what specific criteria define a \"professional golfer\" for the purposes of this agreement? Similarly, is \"ADAMS GOLF, LTD.\" a specific legal entity (e.g., a corporation) and what is its jurisdiction? These details are important for the enforceability of the contract.",

        "explanation": "The term \"best efforts\" is ambiguous and does not define the required level of commitment. What constitutes \"best efforts\"? How is it measured? The absence of specific metrics makes this obligation difficult to enforce.  The phrase \"as reasonably requested\" is also vague. It lacks any defined criteria for what constitutes a reasonable request.",

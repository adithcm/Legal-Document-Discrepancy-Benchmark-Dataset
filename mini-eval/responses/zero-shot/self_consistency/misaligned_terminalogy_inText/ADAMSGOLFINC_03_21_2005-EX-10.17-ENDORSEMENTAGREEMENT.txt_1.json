        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section appears contradictory. While it mandates exclusive use of ADAMS GOLF's MANDATORY PRODUCTS, it simultaneously permits the use of other manufacturers' clubs, including a putter, as long as they are not endorsed. This creates an ambiguity because playing a non-ADAMS GOLF club, even without endorsement, could be perceived as conflicting with the exclusivity requirement.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'satisfactory record of play' is not defined in this section. This ambiguity makes the 'minimum number of tournaments' clause difficult to enforce, as there's no clear metric for what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play.'",

FAILURE TO PLAY Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Requiring the estate of the CONSULTANT to repay ADAMS GOLF in the event of death is a contradiction and may be unenforceable. A party's obligation to perform is generally excused by death or impossibility. This clause may contradict general legal principles.",

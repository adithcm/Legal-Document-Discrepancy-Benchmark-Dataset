        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, it doesn't specify what happens if the Joint Venture needs capital and the parties don't agree. This creates an ambiguity as to how the Joint Venture would be funded if unexpected expenses arise and no mutual consent for contribution is given. This omission can lead to disputes regarding financial responsibilities.",

        "explanation": "The term \"Founders\" is used in this section, but it is not defined anywhere in the agreement. The agreement refers to the parties as \"Joint Venturers\" or \"Parties,\" creating a misalignment in terminology and introducing ambiguity. It's unclear whether \"Founders\" refers to the same entities as \"Joint Venturers.\"",

        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed, as \"not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination\" modifies the extension by written agreement and not the termination date of February 28, 2004. The way it's written can be confusing, giving the impression the agreement is extended 30 days prior to the termination date.",

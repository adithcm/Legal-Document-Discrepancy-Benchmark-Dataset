        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall not be required to wear ADAMS GOLF [*****] in [*****] ads.",
        "explanation": "This section seems to contradict the overall exclusivity agreement outlined in paragraphs 4A, 4B, and 4C. While those paragraphs restrict Watson from endorsing competing products, this section provides an exception, stating he doesn't have to wear Adams Golf apparel in certain ads ([*****] ads). This creates a potential conflict, as it's unclear if not wearing the apparel constitutes an endorsement of a competitor, or if it's simply a neutral stance allowed by this exception. The ambiguity arises because the type of ads is redacted.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section establishes a minimum number of tournaments Watson must play per year and a penalty for not meeting that number. However, the actual required minimum number of tournaments is redacted ([*****]). Without knowing this number, it's impossible to determine if Watson is in compliance or to calculate any potential repayment amount. This omission creates a significant ambiguity in a key performance obligation.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if the agreement is terminated due to the consultant's death or inability to play, any unperformed duties shall be repaid to ADAMS GOLF and calculated in the same way as paragraph 8A. However, paragraph 8A has a redacted section, meaning it's ambiguous on how to calculate how much money is owed, meaning there is a contradiction.",

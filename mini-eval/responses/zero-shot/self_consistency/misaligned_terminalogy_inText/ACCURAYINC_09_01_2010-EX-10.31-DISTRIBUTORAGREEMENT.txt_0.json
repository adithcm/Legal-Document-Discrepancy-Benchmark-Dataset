To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that Accuray must accept or reject a Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. Failure to do so constitutes disapproval. This is a deadline.",

        "explanation": "This section allows the Distributor to cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed it within two weeks of receipt. Execution typically implies acceptance, meaning this supports the two week acceptance/rejection period. However, Section 2.3.3 states that failure to respond within two weeks constitutes disapproval, not necessarily a lack of execution. This could create confusion as to whether the Distributor can cancel a purchase order that has been 'disapproved' via a non-response from Accuray or only when Accuray has simply failed to take action to execute the purchase order.",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency regarding who bears the cost of expedited delivery. It states that Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the example contradicts this by implying Accuray only bears the cost if the requested date is December 1st, meaning the language is unclear.",

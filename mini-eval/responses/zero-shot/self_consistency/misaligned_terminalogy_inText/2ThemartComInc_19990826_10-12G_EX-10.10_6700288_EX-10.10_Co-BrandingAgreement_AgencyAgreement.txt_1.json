        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The clause states that the agreement is automatically renewed for another year if neither party gives notice of non-renewal. This contradicts the prior statement that renewal requires mutual written agreement. This presents an inconsistency in how the agreement is renewed.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the Indemnified Party: (i) giving the Indemnifying Party notice of the relevant claim, (ii) cooperating with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in the defense of such claim, and (iii) giving the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense and settlement of any such claim, except that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that affects the Indemnified Party's rights or interest without the Indemnified Party's prior written approval. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense at its expense.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence creates ambiguity regarding the scope of indemnification. It states that the Protected Party is indemnified only if considered a \"key agent\" of the Guarantor, but this term is not defined, creating ambiguity. The remainder of the section outlines specific scenarios of indemnification without referencing the 'key agent' requirement, making it unclear whether that initial condition applies to all subsequent indemnification obligations.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The statement outlines how the 'Revised Pricing' will be attached as an exhibit to the contract. However, there are no exhibits after Exhibit A, or a revised pricing exhibit. This is an omission of a key part of the contract, where pricing is determined.",

The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "Section 4 grants exclusivity to Adams Golf regarding endorsements, preventing Watson from endorsing competing products. However, section 4D includes numerous exceptions allowing Watson to endorse [*****] under certain conditions, including allowing [*****] to use his name/likeness in advertising, which seems to contradict the initial exclusivity clauses (4A, 4B, 4C). While the section attempts to define parameters for this exception, it is heavily redacted which makes it unclear how exactly Watson is permitted to endorse competing products without violating the exclusivity agreement.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT: A.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude, B.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community, D.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT. ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph states that Adams Golf can terminate the agreement immediately if Watson's actions reduce the value of his endorsement, but it also stipulates that Adams Golf must exercise this right within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct. The term 'immediately' contradicts the clause that Adams Golf must exercise its right of termination within 90 days of becoming aware of the conduct.",

TERMINATION FOR CAUSE Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",

However, paragraph 8A references 'a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events'. This repayment condition is based on performance, it is misaligned to force CONSULTANT or CONSULTANT's estate to repay ADAMS GOLF in the event of death or inability to play golf.",

        "section": "(a) \"CONTENT\" means all digital assets, regardless of medium, that either party provides to the other for use in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, text, audio files, visual recordings, images, datasets, or programs. Assets given by 2TheMart will be known as \"2TheMart Material,\" while assets given by i-Escrow are termed \"i-Escrow Media.\"",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"CONTENT\" is too broad and doesn't define clear boundaries. The definition only indicates what the content 'includes' but does not specifically state whether it is limited to only what is listed. This can be interpreted in many ways.",

        "section": "After Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",

Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The initial sentence creates ambiguity around who the 'Protected Party' is, if they are considered a 'key agent of the Guarantor'. This means that the guarantor will only protect the protected party if they are considered a key agent. This is contradictory since, if the protected party is an external party, the protected party will not be an agent of the guarantor.",

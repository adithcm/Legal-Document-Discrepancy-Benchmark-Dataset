        "section": "Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence implies that if Accuray doesn't respond within two weeks, the Purchase Order is automatically disapproved. However, the second sentence then states that each purchase 'shall be accomplished' by the execution of the Purchase Order, implying active acceptance is always required. This creates a contradiction because the first sentence suggests passive disapproval while the second requires active approval for a purchase to be 'accomplished'.",

        "explanation": "Section 4.1.2 states that if a purchase order was submitted six months prior to the delivery date, and expedited shipping is needed to meet the delivery date, Accuray will pay. However, Section 3.6 states that the Distributor must send a Purchase Order six months prior to the expected shipment date, which is a misaligment.",

        "explanation": "This section defines the Warranty Period as one year after installation but no more than 18 months after shipment. This creates a potential contradiction. If installation takes longer than 6 months after shipment, the warranty period effectively shrinks, which could be misconstrued.",

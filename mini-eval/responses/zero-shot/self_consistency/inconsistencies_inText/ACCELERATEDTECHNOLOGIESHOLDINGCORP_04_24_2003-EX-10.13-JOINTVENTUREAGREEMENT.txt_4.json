        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture. The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture shall be made.",
        "explanation": "This section grants each Joint Venturer authority to execute instruments, but immediately restricts this authority by requiring written consent for incurring liabilities, disposing of assets, or making purchase commitments. This creates an internal contradiction; the initial grant of authority is significantly undermined by the subsequent limitations, making the extent of each venturer's independent authority unclear.",

However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines two different conditions for ending the joint venture. The first states that the joint venture will terminate on February 28, 2004, unless extended, and the second allows either party to terminate the agreement with 60 days written notice. This section creates confusion because it's not clear whether the 60-day notice can be given at any time, even overriding the initial term, or if it applies only after the initial term has expired and been extended.",

        "explanation": "Section 9 states that distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. However, there is an exception for PVSS, stating that PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability. This creates a contradiction because it is not clear if the payment will continue even if it means that the Joint Venture assets are not in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture.",

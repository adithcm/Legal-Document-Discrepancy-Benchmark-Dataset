The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity due to the redactions. It's unclear what CONSULTANT is allowed to endorse and under what specific conditions, leading to potential disputes over the scope of exclusivity granted to ADAMS GOLF. The redactions make it difficult to determine the exact nature of the exception to the exclusivity clause.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "The term \"satisfactory record of play\" is not defined, leading to ambiguity. This could lead to disputes over whether CONSULTANT met the minimum requirement, even if he participated in the specified number of events. Also, the document provides conflicting information by stating different amounts to repay. First the document mentions the consultant will repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved. Then the document changes direction by stating a set repayment amount per calendar year.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a contradiction regarding repayment upon termination. It initially states that no repayment is required if the inability to play is due to an injury during an Adams Golf promotional event. However, it then states that CONSULTANT or their estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the period not performed, calculated as per paragraph 8A, creating a contradiction regarding the repayment obligation.",

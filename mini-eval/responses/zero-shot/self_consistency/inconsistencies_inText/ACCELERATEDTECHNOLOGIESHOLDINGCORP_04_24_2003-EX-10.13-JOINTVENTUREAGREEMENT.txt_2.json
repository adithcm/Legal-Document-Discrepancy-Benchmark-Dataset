        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, Section 9 later mentions 'his contribution,' implying there is a contribution from each venturer. This creates ambiguity about whether contributions are mandatory or optional.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This clause ensures that Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. (PVSS) will receive a payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's financial success. This contradicts the general principle of joint ventures, where income is typically tied to the venture's performance, as outlined in Section 6 regarding the division of income and losses.",

        "explanation": "Section 11 discusses the procedure for termination and liquidation, stating that assets should be distributed ratably according to prorata interests. However, it then gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. unilateral authority to determine the value of assets in case of a dispute, potentially undermining the fairness of the ratable distribution and creating a conflict of interest.",

        "explanation": "This sentence is a structural flaw in text because it contains a grammatical error and does not make sense. There are extra words within the sentence. It should read: This Agreement shall be deemed effective as of the Effective Date and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",

        "section": "Provider shall allow the Recipient to use [ * * * ] at no cost, until December 31, 2021.",
        "explanation": "This introduces an omission in text. While the agreement outlines the provision of 'Services' and the payment terms related to those services, it does not define what ' * * * ' is. This omission creates an in-text contradiction because the agreement refers to something without properly identifying it, making it difficult to understand the full scope of the agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines how notices should be delivered. Under section (c), it states that the notice will be deemed given on the date sent if sent during normal business hours. However, it does not define what normal business hours are, and can have multiple interpretations. This is considered ambiguity in text.",

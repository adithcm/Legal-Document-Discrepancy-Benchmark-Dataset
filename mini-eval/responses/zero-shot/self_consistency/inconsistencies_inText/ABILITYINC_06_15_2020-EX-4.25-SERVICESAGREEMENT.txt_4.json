        "explanation": "This statement creates a potential contradiction if the \"Services\" are not comprehensively defined. It is unclear what constitutes providing \"services or resources\" to the Provider itself. This could be interpreted broadly, restricting the Provider Representatives from performing any internal tasks for the Provider, even if unrelated to the services provided to the Recipient, or it could be interpreted narrowly to only pertain to services that directly compete with the services provided to the Recipient.",

In all such interviews and appearances, CONSULTANT will use his best efforts to make reference to the ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT and wear [*****] and display ADAMS GOLF'S brand name.",
        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous in text because it states that the CONSULTANT will wear [*****] and display ADAMS GOLF'S brand name, but [*****] is redacted and not explained, making the context and meaning of this sentence unclear and internally inconsistent.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section contains inconsistencies in text because the number of events required is redacted and inconsistent. It refers to a minimum number of events represented by [* ****] and then refers to a different redacted number [*****] in the subsequent sentence regarding repayment. This inconsistency creates confusion about the exact number of events required and leads to in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section is a structural flaw in text because it is not structured properly and does not make sense. It refers to the headwear but does not state what is printed on the headwear. What if the headwear has the competitor's logo? It has to be specific as to what the headwear should entail.",

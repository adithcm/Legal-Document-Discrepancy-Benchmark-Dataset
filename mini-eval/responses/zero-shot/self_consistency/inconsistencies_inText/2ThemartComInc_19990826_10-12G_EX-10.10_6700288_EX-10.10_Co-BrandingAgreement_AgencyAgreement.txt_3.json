        "section": "After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section allows 2TheMart to unilaterally change the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow without requiring i-Escrow's consent. While it states the adjusted rate will be communicated, the lack of a mutual agreement process could be deemed unfair and exploitative, especially if the adjusted rate is significantly higher, potentially undermining the intention of the agreement. Such unilateral adjustment rights may not be fully enforceable depending on jurisdiction and specific fairness doctrines.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The section states that the agreement renews automatically if either party does not give a 30-day notice of non-renewal. However, it *also* states that the agreement may be renewed for successive one-year terms by *mutual written agreement*. This creates a contradiction: Does the agreement renew automatically (unilaterally) or does it require mutual agreement?",

        "explanation": "This section has contradictory language. First it states that all provisions of this agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination.' Then, the agreement states that sections 1, 7, 8.5, 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement. This is an in-text contradiction.",

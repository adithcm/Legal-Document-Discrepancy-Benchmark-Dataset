        "section": "During the term of the Joint Venture, no interest shall be allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. No Joint Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided, however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the distribution of income but introduces a contradiction with the guaranteed payment to PVSS. The initial clauses suggest distributions are dependent on profitability and require mutual consent, while the final clause guarantees a $10,000 monthly payment to PVSS regardless of the Joint Venture's financial status. This creates an inconsistency regarding distribution priorities and could lead to disputes if the Joint Venture is not profitable.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section details the procedure for termination and liquidation, specifically addressing asset distribution. It states that if the parties cannot agree on the value of an asset, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. has the final say. This creates an imbalance in power and potentially allows CCGI to undervalue assets to their benefit during liquidation, creating a structural flaw.",

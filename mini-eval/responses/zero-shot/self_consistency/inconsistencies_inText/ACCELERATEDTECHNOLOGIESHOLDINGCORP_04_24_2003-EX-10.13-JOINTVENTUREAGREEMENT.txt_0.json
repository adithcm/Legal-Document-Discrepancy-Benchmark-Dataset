The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination. However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction. It states the joint venture terminates on February 28, 2004, unless extended by written agreement. However, it also allows either party to unilaterally terminate the agreement with 60 days' notice. This contradicts the initial termination date as a party could terminate the agreement before February 28, 2004, even without an extension agreement being in place, and creates ambiguity in how the agreement can be terminated.",

        "explanation": "The statement \"unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination\" is structurally flawed and hard to understand. It should read \"unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers at least thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled termination.\"",

        "section": "9. Distributions. During the term of the Joint Venture, no interest shall be allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. No Joint Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided, however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines distribution rules and then introduces an exception for PVSS to receive a guaranteed payment. This creates a contradiction because earlier in the section, it states that 'No Joint Venturer shall withdraw...any other funds or property of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers'. The guaranteed payment to PVSS circumvents this requirement, potentially allowing PVSS to receive funds even if CCGI does not consent. Furthermore, the statement that each distribution shall be made ratably is also contradicted.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "The section details the procedure for asset distribution upon termination, requiring agreement on price if an asset cannot be divided. However, the final sentence gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. unilateral authority to determine the asset's value in case of a dispute. This contradicts the earlier requirement for mutual agreement and potentially disadvantages Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. during liquidation, undermining the 'prorata interests' mentioned earlier in the section.",

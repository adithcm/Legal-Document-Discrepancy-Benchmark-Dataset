        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding renewal. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then also states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. These two statements contradict each other.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally change the advertising fees without i-Escrow's consent is a significant imbalance of power and could be deemed unconscionable or against good faith principles, especially if the adjustment is substantial and negatively impacts i-Escrow's profitability. This creates ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction. It first states that ALL provisions of the agreement will survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. The next sentence directly contradicts the previous sentence by stating which sections will NOT survive expiration or termination of the agreement.",

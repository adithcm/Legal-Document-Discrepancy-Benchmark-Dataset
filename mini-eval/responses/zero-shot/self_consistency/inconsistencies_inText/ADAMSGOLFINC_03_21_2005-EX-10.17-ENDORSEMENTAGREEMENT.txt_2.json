If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section allows Watson to endorse and play the [*****], which seemingly contradicts the exclusivity clauses in 4A, 4B, and 4C. The paragraph attempts to reconcile this by specifying conditions under which the [*****] endorsement is permissible (consistent with past practices) and restrictions (no [*****] logo on Adams Golf products). However, the heavy redaction makes it impossible to fully assess the scope and impact of this exception. The statement \"CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]\" is vague. It is unclear what actions CONSULTANT will take or what constitutes a remedy.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1.

However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "Section 8 outlines the minimum number of tournaments Watson must play and the repayment schedule if he fails to meet that minimum. However, it introduces a clause stating, \"However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification.\" This clause contradicts the initial one-month payment deadline. Because the \"extenuating circumstances\" are determined solely by the consultant, it provides a loophole to manipulate the original payment schedule.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A.

It states that if Adams Golf consistently fails to provide adequate product as outlined in Section 17A, Watson can terminate the agreement without being required to repay Adams Golf for the unperformed period. This is a reasonable exception. However, the amount repaid by the CONSULTANT in the event of a breach is calculated in the same way as in paragraph 8A. However, 8A discusses repayment due to the failure to participate in the minimum amount of games, which is a completley different topic. ",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The unilateral right of 2TheMart to adjust the advertising fee formula without i-Escrow's consent is a discrepancy. Contract modifications generally require mutual agreement. Allowing one party to unilaterally change a key financial term introduces an imbalance and potential for abuse.",

A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction in the automatic renewal terms. It states the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement and that a party wishing to renew shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect, but then also states that if either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year. This creates a contradiction in what has to be done in order for the agreement to be renewed.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination.

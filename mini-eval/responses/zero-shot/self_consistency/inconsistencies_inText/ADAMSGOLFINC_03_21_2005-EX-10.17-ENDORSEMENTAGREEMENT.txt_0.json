However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "The primary discrepancy arises from the initial statement mandating payment within one month of the calendar year's end, which is directly contradicted by the subsequent allowance of a 90-day delay under unspecified 'extenuating circumstances.' This introduces significant ambiguity, as it doesn't clarify what qualifies as an extenuating circumstance, granting the consultant excessive discretion. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes over payment timeliness and enforcement.",

        "explanation": "There's a contradiction in the payment terms. The clause initially states payment is due within one month of the calendar year's end (e.g., by January 31st). However, it then allows for a 90-day delay under 'extenuating circumstances' at the consultant's discretion with written notification. This creates ambiguity around the payment deadline, making it unclear when payment is definitively due and under what conditions the delay is permissible.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice.

        "explanation": "This section presents a clear contradiction. It initially states that upon termination due to the consultant's death or inability to play, repayment is required for the unfulfilled period of the agreement. However, it introduces an exception stating that if the inability to play is due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment is required. It then reverts to stating that repayment IS required, creating conflicting terms.",

However, it then provides an exception: if the termination is due to Adams Golf's failure to provide adequate product as per section 17A, no repayment is required.

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. It states that the consultant must exclusively use MANDATORY PRODUCT, but then immediately allows for exceptions, permitting the use of non-Adams Golf clubs (including a putter) as long as they are not endorsed. The term 'exclusively' is undermined by the allowance of other clubs, creating ambiguity.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1.  Year 1. $[*****]\n2.  Year 2 $[*****]\n3.  Year 3 $[*****]\n4.  Year 4 $[*****]\n5.  Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification.",
        "explanation": "This section presents conflicting terms regarding the repayment timeframe. The first sentence in subsection B states the payment should be made within one month following the end of the calendar year. However, the second sentence adds that in 'certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant,' payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. The term 'extenuating circumstances' is not defined, leading to potential disputes on when the delay is justified, creating an inconsistency in text regarding deadlines.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section sets the conditions for termination due to a material breach. It states that upon termination, the CONSULTANT is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed portion of the agreement. However, it then carves out an exception: repayment is not required if the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. This section's inconsistency lies in the 'material breach' clause, which typically implies fault on one side, but the repayment terms vary significantly depending on who is at fault and which specific breach occurred (failure to provide adequate product).",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The section states that failure to respond to a Purchase Order in two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, it then says that a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This implies that execution is required for acceptance, which could occur after the two-week period, contradicting the earlier statement about automatic disapproval. It creates confusion around the actual acceptance process.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section creates an inconsistency regarding who pays for expedited shipping. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order, Accuray pays. However, if it is less than six months, the Distributor pays. This part is consistent. What is inconsistent is the conditional \"if feasible\" and the statement, \"Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order...\" These two sentences contradict the time constraints put in place.",

        "explanation": "While this Section states that the agreement supersedes all prior agreements, and that if there is a contradiction between the two agreements, that this agreement shall prevail, there are numerous places in this contract that refer back to the Strategic Alliance Agreement. Because of the numerous times that it refers back to the Strategic Alliance Agreement, this contract is dependent on the Strategic Alliance Agreement, which contradicts that the contract contains the entire agreement of the parties.",

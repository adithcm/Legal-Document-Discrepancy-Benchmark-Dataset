However, the definition of services within the document, states that the provider can agree to respond in good faith to any reasonable request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit. These definitions contradict each other because it seems like the provider representatives are solely dedicated to the Services that were originally agreed upon, but if the recipient requests additional services then the provider representatives are not solely dedicated to the original services.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction. It states that the agreement may be renewed by *mutual written agreement* but then also states that the agreement shall be *automatically renewed* if notice is not given. These two sentences contradict each other.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section is problematic because it allows 2TheMart to unilaterally change the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow. This lack of mutuality could be viewed as unconscionable and potentially unenforceable. Basic contract law requires consideration for both parties.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction in this section. It states that \"all rights granted herein shall terminate\" upon expiration or termination, but then also says that provisions will survive termination \"to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination.\" This is followed by a list of sections that do NOT survive expiration or termination of the agreement, which includes this very section (8.5), creating a contradiction.",

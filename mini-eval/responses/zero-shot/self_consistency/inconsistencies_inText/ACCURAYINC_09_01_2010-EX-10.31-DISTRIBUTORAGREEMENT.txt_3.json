        "section": "To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Accuray's failure to respond to a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, it also states that each Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This creates an ambiguity: if Accuray does not respond within two weeks, is the Purchase Order automatically disapproved, or can it still be accepted later if an authorized representative executes it?",

        "explanation": "Section 3.7 requires Distributor to report customer complaints promptly to Accuray via email. However, there is no defined timeframe for 'promptly'. This lack of specificity could lead to disputes regarding whether the distributor acted quickly enough, especially if delays result in damages or other negative consequences.",

        "explanation": "This section describes Accuray's indemnity obligations regarding intellectual property infringement. The phrase 'in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product' is ambiguous. It is unclear whether the patent infringement must occur in that specific country, or if the patent can be issued in any country as long as the product was delivered to the specified country. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about the scope of Accuray's indemnity obligations.",

        "section": "Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 1.0% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence establishes a clear interest rate for past due balances. However, the subsequent sentence introduces a condition based on German law ( 14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\") that significantly alters when a payment is considered past due for 'business persons.' This creates ambiguity and a contradiction: under general contract law, a payment might be considered past due after a set period, but under the German law clause, it's only past due after a demand note is received and ignored. This contradicts the initial statement and makes it unclear when interest actually begins to accrue.",

        "explanation": "Section 5.4.1.2 outlines the payment schedule for wire transfers. Sub-section 5.4.1.2.1 requires an initial payment of US $100,000 upon acceptance of the Purchase Order.  Sub-section 5.4.1.2.2 states that the 'remaining balance' is due net 60 days after delivery. This contradicts standard business practices, as a significant balance (typically a substantial portion of the total) is usually required before shipment/delivery of goods, not after. This contradiction raises questions about the intended payment structure and could lead to financial risk for Accuray.",

        "explanation": "The section mandates 'full payment' within 45 days of delivery, creating a contradiction with common business practice where partial payment/deposit is expected upfront. This exposes Accuray to risk, as they ship products without any initial payment. Additionally, section 5.4.1 dictates payment terms for system purchases in two installments. Section 5.4.2 contradicts this by requiring full payment 45 days after delivery for products other than systems. This inconsistent approach to payment across different product types causes confusion.",

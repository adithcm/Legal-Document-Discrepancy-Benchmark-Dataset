        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Section 5.1 allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow. This is a significant point of contention because it gives 2TheMart the power to change a fundamental part of the agreement without i-Escrow's consent. While it mentions reflecting 'present market conditions,' the lack of specific criteria or limitations on these adjustments introduces ambiguity and potential for unfair or exploitative rate changes. This contradicts the principle of mutual agreement and good faith typically expected in contractual relationships.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence of Section 8.1 creates a contradiction. It states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal 30 days before the expiration date, the agreement will automatically renew for another year. However, the previous sentences require 'mutual written agreement' for renewal, which implies active consent from both parties. The automatic renewal clause bypasses the need for mutual agreement, creating an inconsistency in the terms governing renewal.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The text provides contradictory information regarding which sections survive termination. The first portion of the paragraph states that all rights granted herein shall terminate and that i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. However, the text then states that even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Then the document ends the paragraph by saying Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",

        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section describes how distributions are to be made. First stating distributions can only occur if assets exceed liabilities and are distributed proportionally. However, it then states that PVSS shall receive a guaranteed payment regardless of profitability. This contradicts the earlier statement that distributions are dependent on the Joint Venture's financial status and prorata interests.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the procedure for termination and liquidation of the Joint Venture. It states that if there is a dispute over the valuation of the assets, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say. This is a contradiction, as a Joint Venture is intended to be a mutual decision making agreement, but having one party decide the value of an asset is not mutual.",

However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states the joint venture shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement, but then proceeds to say either joint venturer can terminate the agreement with a written notice of sixty (60) days. This contradicts the initial term, because one party can unilaterally end the agreement early.",

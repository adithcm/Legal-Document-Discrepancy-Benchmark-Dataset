        "section": "2.2 Terms of Payment and Related Matters. (a) As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs. (b) (i) Provider shall provide Recipient with monthly invoices (\"Invoices\"), which shall set forth in reasonable detail, with such supporting documentation as Recipient may reasonably request with respect to Out-of-Pocket Costs, amounts payable under this Agreement, and (ii) payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of an Invoice by Recipient from Provider.",
        "explanation": "This clause is ambiguous as it sets terms of payment in the first part (a) and then immediately switches to another term in (b). A normal payment structure would require both of them together in a clear structure.",

This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2. 3.2 Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause, and without liability except, in the case of the Recipient, for required payment for services rendered and reimbursement for authorized expenses incurred, by providing at least 30 (thirty) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "Section 3.1 states the agreement terminates on December 31, 2020. Section 3.2 allows either party to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice. This creates a contradiction. If a party provides notice on December 15, 2020, the termination date would be January 14, 2021, which is beyond the stated termination date in Section 3.1. Thus, the two sections contradict each other.",

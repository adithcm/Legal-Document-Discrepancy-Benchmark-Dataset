        "explanation": "The contract term's end date is left undefined, creating ambiguity. Without a specific termination date, it's impossible to determine the exact duration of the agreement, leading to potential disputes regarding its validity and the parties' obligations over time.",

        "section": "For the entire term of this Agreement, from September 1, 2004 through [*****] ADAMS GOLF *intends* to pay CONSULTANT a base compensation of [*****] dollars. Payment of the base compensation will be subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value.",
        "explanation": "The wording around base compensation is not definitive. By stating that ADAMS GOLF 'intends' to pay and making the payment 'subject to' financial performance and brand value evaluation, the contract does not guarantee the consultant any base compensation. This is a structural flaw because it uses non-committal language regarding a key element of the agreement (compensation).",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that if the consultant dies or is unable to play, they (or their estate) must repay ADAMS GOLF for the unfulfilled portion of the agreement. This creates a contradiction because it implies that a deceased person, or someone completely unable to perform due to circumstances outside their control, is still responsible for financial obligations. This contradicts the general principle that contracts become unenforceable upon death or complete inability to perform.",

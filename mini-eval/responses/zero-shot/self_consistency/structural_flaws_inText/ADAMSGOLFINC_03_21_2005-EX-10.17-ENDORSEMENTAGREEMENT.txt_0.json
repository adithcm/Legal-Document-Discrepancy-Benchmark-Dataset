        "explanation": "The initial statement defines 'Mandatory Products' as those CONSULTANT *must* exclusively use. However, the subsequent sentence contradicts this by allowing CONSULTANT to use other manufacturers' products at his discretion if ADAMS GOLF's products are unsuitable or unavailable. This creates an ambiguity regarding the exclusivity requirement, undermining the definition's clarity and enforceability.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall endeavor to achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he *may*, at ADAMS GOLF's sole discretion, be required to repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows: The agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year: 1. Year 1. $[*****] 2. Year 2 $[*****] 3. Year 3 $[*****] 4. Year 4 $[*****] 5. Year 5 $[*****] B. If repayment is deemed necessary by ADAMS GOLF, payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following notification of the required repayment.",
        "explanation": "The language in Section 8A states that if the consultant fails to participate in the minimum number of events, he *may* be required to repay ADAMS GOLF. This introduces ambiguity, as it does not clearly define the circumstances under which repayment will be mandatory versus discretionary. This ambiguity is a structural flaw and makes it difficult to determine the consultant's precise obligations.",

Payment of the base compensation will be subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value.",
        "explanation": "The use of the word \"intends\" introduces a significant ambiguity regarding ADAMS GOLF's obligation to pay the base compensation. It suggests that payment is not guaranteed, making the compensation conditional on ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and their evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value. The lack of objective criteria for this evaluation makes the payment terms vague and potentially unenforceable.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as determined necessary by either Joint Venturer, regardless of mutual consent.",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts general principles of joint ventures, which typically require mutual consent for major decisions like capital contributions. Allowing either venturer to unilaterally demand capital contributions could lead to financial strain or unfair burden on the other, undermining the collaborative nature of the venture. This contradicts the implied understanding of a joint venture as a mutually agreed upon business arrangement.",

        "section": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until terminated by either party with a thirty (30) day notice, regardless of the original termination date.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity by stating the Joint Venture commences on a specific date but can be terminated by either party with only thirty days' notice. This is contradictory because joint ventures are usually long-term contracts. The phrase 'regardless of the original termination date' is confusing because an 'original termination date' is not stipulated elsewhere in the contract.",

However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'all other distributions will adhere to the original terms' creates ambiguity, given that 'original terms' for distributions (beyond the 10% unilateral withdrawal) aren't clearly defined elsewhere in the agreement. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over how profits and assets should be distributed, especially upon termination of the joint venture.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as determined necessary by either Joint Venturer, regardless of mutual consent.",
        "explanation": "This statement implies that either joint venturer can unilaterally demand capital contributions from the other, which contradicts the basic principle of a joint venture requiring mutual agreement on significant financial decisions. Requiring contributions 'regardless of mutual consent' undermines the collaborative nature of the venture and could lead to financial strain or disputes.",

        "section": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until terminated by either party with a thirty (30) day notice, regardless of the original termination date. This termination clause supersedes any prior agreement regarding the venture's term.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'regardless of the original termination date' creates ambiguity.  It implies there was a prior agreed-upon termination date, but this clause now allows termination with 30 days' notice, effectively rendering the original agreement meaningless. This makes the term of the joint venture uncertain and subject to the whim of either party.",

However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
        "explanation": "The statement is contradictory. First, it states a Joint Venturer can unilaterally withdraw funds at any time, regardless of the other Joint Venturer's consent. However, it then limits this right to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. The 'all other distributions will adhere to the original terms' is ambiguous because it is not specified what the original terms are.",

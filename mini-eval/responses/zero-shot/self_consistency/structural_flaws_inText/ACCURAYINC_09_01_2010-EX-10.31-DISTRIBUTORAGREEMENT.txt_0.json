        "section": "\"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, including Australia and other than India and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan. For the avoidance of doubt, 'Accuray Regions' shall only refer to North America.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Accuray Regions' initially includes multiple regions but then is immediately limited to only North America. This creates an internal contradiction as the initial definition is negated by the subsequent clarification, potentially causing confusion about the scope of the agreement in different geographical locations.",

Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section presents conflicting information regarding the acceptance of a Purchase Order. It states that failure to respond within two weeks constitutes disapproval, but it also states that acceptance occurs upon execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative. This creates ambiguity as to whether a Purchase Order is considered accepted if Accuray doesn't respond within two weeks but later executes the Purchase Order.",

However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",
        "explanation": "This section includes contradictory statements regarding the warranty period. It initially defines the warranty period as one year following installation (up to 18 months after shipment), but then states that Accuray warrants the system to be free from defects for the expected lifetime of the product. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the actual duration and scope of the warranty.",

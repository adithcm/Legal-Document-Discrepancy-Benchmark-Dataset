The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
        "explanation": "The statement creates ambiguity regarding who is ultimately responsible for the employees. It initially states the employees remain employees of the Provider, but then indicates they may be 'deemed employees of Recipient for specific purposes'. The language is unclear, particularly concerning liability and control, which could lead to disputes.",

        "explanation": "The final sentence, 'The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis,' is problematic. Tax law is not determined case-by-case; there are established rules and regulations. Shifting tax responsibilities without clear guidelines violates legal principles.",

However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting information. The initial statement allows termination 'at any time without cause', but the following sentence imposes a 90-day notice period and a termination fee. This creates ambiguity as to when the agreement can truly be terminated, leading to potential disputes. The notice period contradicts the 'at any time' clause.",

        "explanation": "Section (d) states that notices sent via mail are 'deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.' This contradicts standard legal practice and introduces significant risk. Certified or registered mail with return receipt is generally required to prove receipt of important notices. This clause makes it difficult to prove that the other party actually received the notice.",

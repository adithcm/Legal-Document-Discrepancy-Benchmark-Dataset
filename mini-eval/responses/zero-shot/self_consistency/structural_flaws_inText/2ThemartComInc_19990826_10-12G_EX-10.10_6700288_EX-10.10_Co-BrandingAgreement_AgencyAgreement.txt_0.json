        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "The clause that 'advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion' and 'i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent' effectively gives i-Escrow the power to set the advertising fees to any amount, even zero, which undermines the purpose of the agreement for 2TheMart. This creates an imbalance and ambiguity about the actual value 2TheMart will receive.",

        "explanation": "This is a direct contradiction. The first part of the sentence states that each party shall hold the other party's Confidential Information in confidence, but the second part of the sentence states that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time. This makes the section meaningless.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence states 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated.' This is unclear because earlier in the paragraph it was stated that 'This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.' The contradiction is that the prior sentence implies that the agreement needs to be renewed by both parties instead of just one. It is unclear if the agreement would be terminated if both parties do not agree to renew, or if one party does not give notice.",

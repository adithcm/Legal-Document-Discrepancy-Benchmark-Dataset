        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. These advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions at i-Escrow's discretion. i-Escrow may adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent.",
        "explanation": "This section gives i-Escrow complete control over setting and changing the advertising fees paid to 2TheMart. The agreement states that the fees are based on the number of Transaction Inquiries, but the amount per inquiry is determined and revised at i-Escrow's sole discretion, without needing consent from 2TheMart. This is a contradiction of the agreement because both companies should have a say in the amount 2TheMart is being paid.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the agreement will be considered terminated.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if notice is not given, the agreement will be considered terminated. However, it is ambiguous as to whether the agreement is terminated by the company that did not give notice or the other company.",

A party's \"Confidential Information\" is defined as any information, regardless of whether it is marked confidential or identified as such, that one party provides to the other. Each party shall hold the other party's Confidential Information in confidence, except that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time. Such restrictions shall not apply to Confidential Information which (a) is already known by the recipient, (b) becomes, through no act or fault of the recipient, publicly known, (c) is received by recipient from a third party without a restriction on disclosure or use, or (d) is independently developed by recipient without reference to the Confidential Information. The restriction on disclosure shall not apply to Confidential Information which is required to be disclosed by a court or government agency. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, within fourteen (14) days of the other party's request, each party will return all Confidential Information and other deliverables to the requesting party.",
        "explanation": "This section includes contradictory statements regarding the confidentiality of information. It initially states that each party shall hold the other's Confidential Information in confidence, but immediately contradicts this by stating that either party may disclose the other party's confidential information to any third party at any time. This creates a contradiction, as it's impossible to both hold information in confidence and freely disclose it.",

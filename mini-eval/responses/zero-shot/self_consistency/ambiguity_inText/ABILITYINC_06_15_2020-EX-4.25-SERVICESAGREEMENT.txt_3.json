        "section": "Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This creates an ambiguity because while the Provider agrees to provide services in Exhibit A, they are not obligated to respond to requests for additional services not in Exhibit A, even if those services are necessary for the Recipient's operation. This undermines the purpose of the agreement if necessary services can be denied based on the Provider's discretion.",

        "explanation": "This section states that Recipient shall own all rights to inventions, etc., made by the Provider *if both parties agree it is related to the services*. This creates an ambiguous situation where ownership is contingent on mutual agreement. If the parties disagree, the contract doesn't clearly define who owns the intellectual property. This contradicts the general intent of assigning IP rights to the Recipient for work related to the services provided.",

        "section": "1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement. The following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning: 1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions specifically for CyberKnife products and services (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, excluding Australia, India, and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan.",
        "explanation": "The term 'Accuray Regions' is defined, but it relies on external knowledge of Accuray's sales regions for CyberKnife products and services as of the Effective Date. This means that to fully understand the definition, one needs to know the specific geographic composition of 'the Americas', 'APAC', 'EIMEA', and 'Japan' regions as defined internally by Accuray. This introduces ambiguity because these regions are subject to change. This ambiguity can lead to confusion about which territories are included in each region, which could affect sales targets, marketing strategies, and other geographically dependent aspects of the agreement. As territories are subject to change within the company, the definition would also be subject to change, making it unstable.",

        "section": "3. DUTIES OF DISTRIBUTOR <*$p$*>3.1. Independent Distributor. Distributor shall be and must at all times make it clear that it is an independent entity contracting with Accuray, and is not the employee, representative or agent of Accuray, except when explicitly authorized by Accuray in writing. Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner, unless such authority is expressly delegated to the Distributor by Accuray.<*$p$*>",
        "explanation": "This section states that the Distributor is an independent entity and not an agent of Accuray, unless explicitly authorized in writing. It also states that the Distributor cannot enter into legal agreements that bind Accuray unless expressly delegated. This creates an internal contradiction because it first denies the Distributor any authority to bind Accuray, but then creates an exception where such authority can be delegated. This phrasing could be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to disputes about the scope of the Distributor's authority.",

Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied meet minimum quality standards. Accuray will endeavor to provide to Distributor or Customer, as applicable, in a timely manner those Products and Services required to fill confirmed Purchase Orders received from Distributor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.<*$p$*>",
        "explanation": "While Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied meet minimum quality standards it is not clear what these quality standards are as they are not defined within the document. What are the metrics? Who is responsible for measuring these metrics? At what point can the distributor claim that the quality standards were not met and what would the resolution be? Since these products are related to the medical field, there are strict guidelines that need to be followed and should be explicitly defined within this section.",

Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Accuray and Distributor and subject to the termination rights contained in this Agreement, this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue until the termination of the Strategic Alliance Agreement; provided, however, that if a Termination Election relating to this Agreement is made pursuant to Section 10.3 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement prior to such termination, this Agreement shall terminate 36 months after such Termination Election (the \"Term\").",
        "explanation": "This section defines the term of the agreement by referencing the 'Strategic Alliance Agreement'. However, it also states that if a 'Termination Election' is made, the agreement terminates 36 months after the election. This introduces an inconsistency because the termination date is dependent on an external agreement and a specific event (Termination Election). If the Strategic Alliance Agreement terminates before the 36-month period after a Termination Election, it's unclear which termination date takes precedence. This dependence on an external agreement creates an ambiguity, because one needs to consult the Strategic Alliance Agreement to understand its conditions for termination and the implications of a Termination Election.",

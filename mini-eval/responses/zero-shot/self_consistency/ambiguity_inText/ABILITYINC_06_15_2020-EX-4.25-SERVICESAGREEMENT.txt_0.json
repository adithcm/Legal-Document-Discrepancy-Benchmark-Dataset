However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity regarding the Provider's obligations. While the first sentence states the Provider agrees to provide the services in Exhibit A, the second sentence allows the Provider to refuse requests for additional services necessary for the Recipient's operation if they are not already in the Exhibit. This creates a contradiction because the Provider is agreeing to provide services, but also has the option to deny necessary services.",

        "explanation": "The language 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' is structurally flawed and grammatically incorrect. It doesn't present a clear or coherent meaning. The repeated word 'Agreement' makes the sentence nonsensical.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters'. It is inconsistent to have payment terms survive termination. Generally, obligations for services already rendered and expenses already incurred should survive, but not necessarily the entirety of Section 2.2, which might include ongoing payment obligations. This creates ambiguity regarding which specific payment terms survive and could lead to disputes.",

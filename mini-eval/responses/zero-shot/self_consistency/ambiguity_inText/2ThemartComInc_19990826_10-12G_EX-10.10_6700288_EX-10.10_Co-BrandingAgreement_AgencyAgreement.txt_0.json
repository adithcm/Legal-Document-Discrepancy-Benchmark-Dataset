        "section": "TERMINATION FOR BREACH. In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "This section allows for immediate termination of the agreement for breaches described in sections 2.2, 2.4, and 12.4. However, subsection (a) states that a party can terminate only if the breach is not cured within 60 days. This creates an inconsistency, as the conditions in sections 2.2, 2.4, and 12.4 could be considered material breaches which allow for immediate termination, contradicting the 60-day cure period.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party\" creates ambiguity. The general rule of indemnity is that the indemnifying party is responsible for their own actions. Here, it suggests that the indemnifying party is only responsible if they are acting as an agent of the indemnified party. This limits the scope of the indemnity in a way that's unclear and potentially contradictory to the overall intent of an indemnity clause, which is usually to protect against the indemnifying party's own liabilities. Indemnification usually occurs when an agent acts on behalf of a principle, not the other way around.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines specific requirements for notices to be considered delivered to each party. However, it fails to specify how acknowledgement by phone is to be documented for faxed notices. Without clarifying this, it's ambiguous and difficult to prove that a faxed notice was properly acknowledged, which could lead to disputes over whether proper notice was given.",

        "section": "(c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Customers\" is ambiguous because it requires users to complete at least one transaction *per month*. This is an odd requirement and likely not what the parties intended. It's not clear if this refers to one transaction ever per month the agreement is active, or one transaction every month to be considered a customer, which creates an unreasonable hurdle.",

        "explanation": "The notice section specifies three methods of giving notice, including personal delivery, fax, and overnight courier. However, for overnight courier, it states notice is deemed given \"only three (3) days after the date of mailing.\" This contradicts the purpose of overnight courier, which is to deliver the notice quickly. The language should state notice is deemed given upon confirmation of delivery by the courier.",

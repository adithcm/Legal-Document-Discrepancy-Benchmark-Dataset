        "section": "CUSTOMERS means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' requires them to complete at least one transaction *per month*. This creates an ongoing requirement, which is unusual and potentially burdensome. The contract doesn't specify what happens if a user accesses the Co-Branded Site but doesn't complete a transaction in a given month. Are they no longer considered a 'Customer'? This ambiguity could affect how advertising fees are calculated (Section 5.1), which are based on Transaction Inquiries from Customers.",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a potential contradiction. It states that California Escrow Law prevails in case of conflict. However, it also requires i-Escrow to notify 2TheMart of the conflict and for both parties to use their 'best efforts' to resolve it. This implies that the parties might attempt to negotiate a solution that deviates from the mandatory provisions of California Escrow Law. Escrow laws are in place to protect consumers, and contractually agreeing to circumvent them would likely be unenforceable and potentially illegal.",

        "explanation": "The sentence 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect' is repeated twice. This could be a typo and may not necessarily introduce contradiction, however, it does not make sense to repeat the same sentence and seems to be a mistake.",

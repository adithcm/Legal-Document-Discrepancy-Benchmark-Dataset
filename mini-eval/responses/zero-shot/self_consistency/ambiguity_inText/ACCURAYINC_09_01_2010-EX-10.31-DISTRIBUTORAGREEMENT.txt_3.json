        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting information regarding who bears the supplementary shipping costs. It initially states that Accuray bears these costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the example then clarifies that Accuray bears the expedited delivery costs if the requested delivery date is at least six months out, and the distributor bears it if it is within six months. The initial statement is ambiguously worded, which is corrected with the example.",

For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section mandates that the distributor send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. However, Section 4.1.2 stipulates that Accuray will bear any expedited delivery costs if the delivery date is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. This is a contradiction because if the distributor wants Accuray to pay for expedited shipping the distributor would have to submit the PO far ahead of time which is already stated in section 3.6",

        "explanation": "This clause states that obligations accrued before the effective date of termination must be fulfilled. However, the phrase \"including but not limited to pending Quotes\" creates ambiguity. A Quote is not an obligation but an offer. It is unclear if Accuray is obligated to honor all pending Quotes after termination, even if the Distributor has not yet issued a Purchase Order. This would depend on whether a Quote is considered an 'obligation'.",

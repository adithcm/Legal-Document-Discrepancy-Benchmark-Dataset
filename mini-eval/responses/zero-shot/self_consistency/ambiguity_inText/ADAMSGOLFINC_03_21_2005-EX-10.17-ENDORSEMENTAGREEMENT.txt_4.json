        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever practical. The decision on whether to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT in a specific tournament will be at the sole discretion of the CONSULTANT based on performance considerations. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section allows the consultant to use clubs from other manufacturers while stating he must exclusively use MANDATORY PRODUCTS whenever practical. The term 'whenever practical' is not clearly defined, leading to potential disputes about when it is acceptable to use non-Adams Golf clubs. The end of the section also states that he cannot endorse the other clubs that are not ADAMS GOLF clubs, which contradicts the fact that he can play other clubs.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that the consultant is responsible for all expenses, excluding attorney fees. The second sentence states that ADAMS GOLF will cover consultant's attorney fees up to $10,000. This creates an inconsistency because it is not clear whether or not ADAMS GOLF is responsible for paying attorney fees or not.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section implies that the consultant's estate would be responsible for repaying ADAMS GOLF in the event of the consultant's death. This is an inconsistency, as it would be hard to perform the duties outlined in this agreement if the consultant has passed away. This is an in-text contradiction.",

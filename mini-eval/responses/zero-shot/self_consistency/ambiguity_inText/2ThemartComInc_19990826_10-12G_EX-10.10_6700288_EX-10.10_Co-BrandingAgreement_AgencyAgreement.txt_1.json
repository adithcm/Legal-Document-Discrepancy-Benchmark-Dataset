        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if the Launch Date does not occur within 4 months of the Effective Date, either party can terminate the agreement. However, it then adds a condition that *only* the party that has used good faith and reasonable development efforts can terminate. This creates a contradiction. If neither party has used such efforts, can the agreement be terminated? The first sentence implies yes, but the second implies no.",

        "explanation": "The language 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' creates an ambiguity in the scope of indemnification. Indemnification is typically provided for actions of the Indemnifying Party, not based on a principal-agent relationship with the Indemnified Party. This limits the indemnification obligation in a way that is not standard and potentially contradicts the general intent of an indemnification clause, making it less effective.",

        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous. While it states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon, it doesn't specify what happens if the Joint Venture needs capital and the parties *don't* mutually agree. It's unclear how the Joint Venture will be funded in such a scenario, creating uncertainty about its financial viability.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction in how assets are distributed upon termination. While unexpended funds are distributed proportionally, *all other assets* are distributed at the mediator's discretion, irrespective of ownership interests. This could lead to a situation where a Joint Venturer receives significantly less than their proportional share of the Joint Venture's value. This allocation of assets is not clearly and legally defined.",

        "explanation": "The section outlines the term and extension of the joint venture but only says one venturer can extend the joint venture, but it takes two joint venturers to create this agreement. This is an ambiguity.",

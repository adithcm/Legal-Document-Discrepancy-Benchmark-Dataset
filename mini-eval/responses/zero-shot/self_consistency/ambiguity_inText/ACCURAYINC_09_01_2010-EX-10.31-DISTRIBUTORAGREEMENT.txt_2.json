        "explanation": "This section specifies that complaints should be reported promptly and in writing via email to a specific address. However, it does not define what constitutes 'promptly.' This ambiguity could lead to disputes regarding whether the distributor has met its obligation if there is a delay in reporting a complaint.",

        "explanation": "The section provides two different events that will start the warranty period. If the product is installed within 6 months, the warranty will be one year. If it takes longer than 6 months, the warranty shortens. This is an inconsistency that is not properly explained.",

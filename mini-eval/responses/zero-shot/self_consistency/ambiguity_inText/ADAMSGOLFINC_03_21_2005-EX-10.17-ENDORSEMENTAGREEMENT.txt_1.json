        "section": "CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency in who pays attorney fees. The first sentence states CONSULTANT will indemnify ADAMS GOLF from all expenses, excluding attorney fees, however the second sentence states ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT'S attorney fees up to $10,000.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a structural issue and potential contradiction. It mandates repayment by the Consultant's estate if the Consultant dies, referencing calculation under paragraph 8A. However, paragraph 8A details repayment *by* the Consultant *to* Adams Golf if the consultant does not play a minimum number of tournaments. It is illogical to apply this repayment structure in the event of death, as the reasons for not playing are entirely different. This could lead to disputes regarding the amount owed by the estate, as the original calculation was not intended for this situation.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Similar to Section 22, this section also includes the agreement to repay for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A, which does not make sense because if either party commits a material breach of this agreement, then paragraph 8A does not apply.",

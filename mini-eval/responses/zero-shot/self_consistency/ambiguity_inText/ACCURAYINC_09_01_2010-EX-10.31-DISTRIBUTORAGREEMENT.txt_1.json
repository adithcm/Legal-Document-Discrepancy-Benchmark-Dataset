        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency in responsibility for expedited shipping costs. It states that Accuray bears the costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, but the subsequent example contradicts this by stating Accuray bears costs for a December 1 delivery when the order was submitted on June 1 (exactly six months prior), while the distributor bears the costs if the delivery deadline was October 1. This creates ambiguity about who pays for expedited shipping when the delivery date is exactly six months after the order.",

        "section": "5.4.1.1. Letter of Credit. An irrevocable trade finance letter of credit issued by Distributor's bank, confirmed by a bank designated by Accuray in all respects and delivered to Accuray upon the acceptance of the Purchase Order by Accuray. The letter of credit will provide that Accuray can draw against the letter of credit according to the following schedule: 5.4.1.1.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 5.4.1.1.2. Balance upon presentation of documents by Accuray evidencing shipment of the Products to Distributor or Customer as designated in the Purchase Order.",
        "explanation": "The payment terms outlined in Section 5.4.1.1 for Letter of Credit and Section 5.4.1.2 for Wire Transfer are inconsistent regarding the payment of the remaining balance.  Section 5.4.1.1.2 states the balance is due upon presentation of shipment documents, implying immediate payment upon shipment evidence. However, Section 5.4.1.2.2 states the remaining balance for wire transfers is due net 30 days after delivery. This inconsistency creates confusion and potential disputes over the payment deadline depending on the payment method used.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. 4.6.2. Hardware and Software. If a Customer notifies Accuray in writing during the Warranty Period of a defect in a Product that causes the Product to fail to conform to the foregoing warranty, Accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non- conforming Product or, if in Accuray's opinion such repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable, Accuray shall refund a pro-rated portion of the price paid by the Customer for such Product calculated based on a straight-line depreciation over a 5-year period beginning on the date of delivery. This will be Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and such Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective Products and parts.",
        "explanation": "Section 4.6.2 states that if repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable, Accuray will refund a pro-rated portion of the price based on a straight-line depreciation over a 5-year period beginning on the date of delivery. However, Section 4.6.1 defines the Warranty Period as one year following installation or 18 months following shipment, whichever is shorter. This is a contradiction, because the refund calculation uses a 5-year depreciation period, which extends far beyond the defined Warranty Period during which a defect must be reported.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The repetition of the sentence \"A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect\" is a structural flaw that disrupts the flow and clarity of the section. It introduces redundancy without adding any new information or altering the meaning.",

        "explanation": "The structure of the indemnity clause is flawed. The initial sentence sets a general indemnity obligation for each party based on their actions where the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. The subsequent sentences then specifically name the parties and what they will indemnify each other for. The initial sentence sets a standard that is not common and would be difficult to assess.",

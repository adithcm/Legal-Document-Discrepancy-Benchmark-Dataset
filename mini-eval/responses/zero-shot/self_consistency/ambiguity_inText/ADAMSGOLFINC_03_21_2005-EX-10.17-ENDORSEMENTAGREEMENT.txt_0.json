        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT: A.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude, B.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community, D.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT. ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'public morals and conventions' is ambiguous and can be interpreted differently by different people. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine what specific actions would constitute a breach of the agreement. The clause 'insults or offends the community' is also vague and subjective. It's unclear what standards would be used to determine whether an act insults or offends the community, leading to potential disputes over whether the termination was justified.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section initially states that the consultant is responsible for all liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses. However, the added sentence creates a discrepancy, stating that Adams Golf will cover attorney fees up to $10,000. This is an inconsistency, as the initial statement excludes attorney fees, but the added sentence contradicts that by providing a limit that Adams Golf will cover.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "While the clause allows for termination for 'any material breach,' it only specifies the consultant's repayment obligation upon termination. It omits to address any repayment obligations from ADAMS GOLF, if ADAMS GOLF commits a material breach of the agreement and the consultant terminates for cause.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"including, without limitation, including the Products and Services\" is redundant and structurally flawed. The word \"including\" is used twice right after each other.",

        "explanation": "Section 4.1.2 states that, for delivery deadlines at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order, Accuray will bear supplementary shipping costs. However, if the purchase order is submitted six months prior to shipment date it is not clear who is to bear the supplementary shipping costs. This creates an ambiguity in regards to who is to bear the supplementary shipping costs.",

        "explanation": "The warranty period is defined as one year after installation or 18 months after shipment to the distributor. This means the warranty could be less than a year, which is an ambiguity in text, and an in-text contradiction.",

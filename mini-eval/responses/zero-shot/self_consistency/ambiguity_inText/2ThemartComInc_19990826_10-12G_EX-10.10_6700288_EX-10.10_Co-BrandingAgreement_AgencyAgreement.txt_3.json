        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination if the Launch Date doesn't occur within 4 months of the Effective Date, but it adds a condition that only the party using 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' can terminate. This creates ambiguity. If neither party makes such efforts, can either terminate? The clause is unclear about what happens if neither party fulfills the 'good faith and reasonable efforts' requirement.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The calculation of the advertising fee is ambiguous. The fee is 0.025% of the 'amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter.' However, it's unclear what 'amount of the average Transaction' refers to. Is it the average transaction value, or the total transaction volume? This lack of clarity could lead to disputes.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The statement 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect' is repeated twice, which is a structural flaw in the agreement. It doesn't necessarily create a contradiction, but it indicates poor drafting and raises the possibility of other errors. The redundancy could lead to confusion if future amendments only address one instance of the phrase.",

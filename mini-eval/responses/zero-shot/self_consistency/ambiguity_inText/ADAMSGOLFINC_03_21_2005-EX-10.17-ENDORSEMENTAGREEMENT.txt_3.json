The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section is filled with redactions ([*****]), which obscures the specific terms and conditions related to CONSULTANT's endorsement of [*****]. This makes it difficult to understand the exact scope and limitations of this endorsement, especially in relation to past advertising practices and potential replacements of the endorsement. The numerous redactions create ambiguity regarding the permissible uses of CONSULTANT's name and likeness and whether these uses might conflict with the exclusivity granted to ADAMS GOLF in other sections of the agreement.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1.

The next sentence states that if CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF. These two numbers need to be the same, but because of the redaction, there is no way of knowing if they are the same or not. This section also involves repayment amounts, which are redacted from the document. This makes it impossible to tell the amount that needs to be paid based on the amount of tournaments not attended.",

        "explanation": "The address listed for Tom Watson may not be valid anymore. Addresses change all the time, and it is not clear whether this address is up to date. The second half of the sentence states, 'or at such other address as is given in writing to ADAMS GOLF by CONSULTANT.' This makes the first half of the sentence useless and confusing.",

        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination if the Launch Date isn't achieved within 4 months of the Effective Date, but grants the termination right only to the party that used 'good faith and reasonable development efforts.' This creates ambiguity. What constitutes 'good faith and reasonable efforts' is not defined, leading to potential disputes. If both parties claim they used such efforts, can either terminate? The clause favors the party self-reporting diligent effort, making it difficult to objectively assess.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding renewal. First, it states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement.' However, it then states that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement 'shall be automatically renewed.' This contradicts the initial requirement of mutual agreement. It creates ambiguity as to whether a written agreement is actually required, or if a lack of explicit rejection constitutes implicit agreement.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' creates ambiguity and potential contradiction. The standard indemnity clause covers acts, omissions, or misrepresentations. However, adding the principal/agent limitation significantly narrows the scope. Indemnification is now only triggered if the Indemnified Party is legally considered a 'principal' of the Indemnifying Party for the specific act in question. This severely limits the indemnity's practical value and could be interpreted as contradicting the initial broad indemnity statement.",

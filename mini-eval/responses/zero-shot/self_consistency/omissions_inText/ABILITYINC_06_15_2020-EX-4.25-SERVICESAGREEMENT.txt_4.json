        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and grammatically incorrect. The phrase \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement\" is nonsensical and unclear. It's likely that words are missing or misplaced, leading to a lack of clarity regarding the agreement's effective period.",

(c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "The requirement that the names, positions, experience, and licenses of Provider Representatives 'shall be set out in Exhibit A' creates a potential conflict. Section 1.2(c) states that Provider Representatives must be dedicated to solely providing services to Recipient. However, Exhibit A is subject to amendment or supplement per Section 1.1(a). If Exhibit A is amended to include new Provider Representatives who are not solely dedicated to Recipient, this would contradict the initial exclusivity requirement stated in Section 1.2(c).",

        "explanation": "Section 3.5 states that Section 2.2 survives termination, which governs payment terms. Section 3.6(e) requires the provider to repay fees paid in advance for services not provided upon termination, which is related to payments. Having both of these terms survive creates contradiction, as you can't have both at the same time.",

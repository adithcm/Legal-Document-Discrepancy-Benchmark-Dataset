        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting instructions regarding what CONSULTANT can wear or display. First, it states that in sponsored photo shoots, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. Then, it restricts CONSULTANT from placing a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. These statements create an inconsistency about what the consultant can wear.",

Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'sincere best reasonable judgment' is ambiguous. It's unclear how sincerity, 'best,' and 'reasonable' are to be judged in determining suitability.

The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that in the event of CONSULTANT's death or inability to play, ADAMS GOLF can terminate the agreement, and the CONSULTANT or their estate is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period. It seems illogical and unreasonable to require repayment in the case of death or inability to play, as these are circumstances beyond the CONSULTANT's control.",

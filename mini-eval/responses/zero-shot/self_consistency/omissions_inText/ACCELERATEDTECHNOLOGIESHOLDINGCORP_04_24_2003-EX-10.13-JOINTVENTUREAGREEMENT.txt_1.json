        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it doesn't specify how the need for capital contributions will be determined, who decides the amount, or the consequences if a Joint Venturer fails to contribute. The lack of clarity can lead to disputes over funding obligations.",

        "explanation": "This statement grants each Joint Venturer the authority to independently execute instruments, but it doesn't specify any limitations or required approvals. This could lead to one Joint Venturer taking actions that are detrimental to the other or to the Joint Venture as a whole, creating a contradiction in operational control.",

        "explanation": "Despite explicitly stating the intention not to create a partnership, several aspects of the agreement (e.g., profit/loss sharing, joint control) could be interpreted as creating a de facto partnership under the law. This creates a legal contradiction, especially regarding liability and tax implications.",

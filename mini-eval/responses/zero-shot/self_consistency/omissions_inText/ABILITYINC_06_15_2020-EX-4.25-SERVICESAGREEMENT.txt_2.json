        "explanation": "Section 2.2 describes terms of payment and related matters. The contradiction lies in stating that 'all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate' and then listing Section 2.2 as an exception. Logically, if obligations related to payments survive termination, then 'all obligations' do not, in fact, terminate.",

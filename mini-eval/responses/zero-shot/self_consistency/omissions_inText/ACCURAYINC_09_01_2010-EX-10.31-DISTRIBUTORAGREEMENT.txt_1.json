        "section": "Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "The section states that past due balances will bear interest, but then adds a condition that if the Distributor is a 'business person' under German law, the payment is only past due after a payment demand note is received. This creates ambiguity because it does not state if the interest will be applied before or after the payment demand note is received. It also does not mention when this interest would start applying, creating further ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "This section specifies that a US $100,000 payment is non-refundable but will be automatically applied to the Distributor's next purchase if the Purchase Order is cancelled. However, it doesn't specify under what conditions the Purchase Order can be cancelled. Without these conditions, it creates ambiguity.",

        "section": "B. \"PRODUCT\" shall mean golf clubs.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"PRODUCT\" as simply \"golf clubs\" is overly broad and misaligned. It doesn't specify which types of golf clubs are included (drivers, irons, putters, etc.). This lack of clarity can create confusion as to what products the consultant is obligated to use/endorse exclusively. This is a misalignment because it uses one term without fully explaining all aspects of the term.",

        "explanation": "This definition creates ambiguity because it does not specify *which* Adams Golf products are considered mandatory. This gives ADAMS GOLF the power to force the CONSULTANT to use any product they want, without limitation. This should be explained in more detail within the text. This is an abiguity because there is no clear term of what product is being explained.",

        "section": "7. CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the consultant's recourse if the mandatory product is unsuitable, but it creates an in-text contradiction with the \"Exclusive Use of Product\" clause. Section 5 states that the consultant *shall* exclusively play/use the mandatory product. This section gives ADAMS GOLF the sole discretion on whether or not they supply the CONSULTANT with a product that is acceptable. It is not clear if CONSULTANT can use another brand's product. This situation creates an in-text contradiction because it's not clear what will happen within that 30 day time period.",

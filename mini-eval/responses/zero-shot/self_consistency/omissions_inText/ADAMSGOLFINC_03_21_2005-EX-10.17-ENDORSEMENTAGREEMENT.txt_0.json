        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section first states that the consultant must exclusively use mandatory products, which are defined as Adams Golf Products that the consultant must exclusively play/use. However, the section then states that the consultant may play other clubs in the bag other than Adams Golf clubs, including a putter by another manufacturer. These statements contradict each other, as the consultant can not both exclusively use Adams Golf products and use products from another manufacturer.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section states that in the event that the consultant dies, their estate will be required to repay Adams Golf for the period of the agreement not performed by the consultant. This is a structural flaw in legal terms because if the consultant is deceased, they can no longer perform the services in the contract. Having the estate pay back money for services not rendered due to death is not a proper structure for a legal term and is inherently flawed.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section states that in the event that Adams Golf terminates the contract due to a material breach by the consultant, the consultant is required to repay Adams Golf for that period of the agreement not performed by the consultant. This section is a structural flaw in legal terms because it is expected that the party that breaches the contract should not be getting paid back for a breach they caused. This term does not make sense and is not a proper structure for legal terms.",

        "explanation": "The Term of Contract section has been redacted which makes it difficult to know the actual end date of the contract. This could lead to the contract being unintentionally breached due to a disagreement on the actual end date.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This introduces a potential contradiction. While Adams Golf can terminate the agreement if the consultant is unable to play, the consultant or their estate is required to repay Adams Golf for the unperformed portion of the agreement. If the inability to play is due to death or severe disability, requiring repayment seems inequitable and could be challenged as unconscionable. It is inconsistent with general legal principles regarding impossibility of performance due to death or disability.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Section 23 states that if either party terminates the contract due to a material breach the CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. This creates a contradiction because if ADAMS GOLF breaches the agreement, the consultant can terminate the contract but the consultant still has to repay ADAMS GOLF.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"as needed\" is ambiguous and does not provide a clear framework for determining when and how much capital contributions will be required from each Joint Venturer. This could lead to disputes over the timing and amount of contributions, as it is not clear who decides what is \"needed\" and how this need is assessed.",

Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that neither joint venturer will be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the joint venture. However, it also states that each joint venturer will be reimbursed for all direct expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the joint venture and the promotion of its businesses. This is a contradiction because reimbursement could be seen as compensation, which goes against the agreement. It is ambigious.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"as needed\" is vague and does not provide a clear definition of when and how capital contributions will be determined. This could lead to disputes between the Joint Venturers regarding the amount and timing of such contributions.",

        "explanation": "While the intention to elect out of Subchapter K is clear, the language \"if necessary\" creates ambiguity. It's unclear who determines whether filing documentation is necessary and what criteria are used to make that determination. This could lead to disagreements or a failure to properly execute the election, potentially causing unintended tax consequences.",

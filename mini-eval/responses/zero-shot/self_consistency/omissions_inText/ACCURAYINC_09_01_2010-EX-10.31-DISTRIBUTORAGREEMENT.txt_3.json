        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency regarding who bears the supplementary shipping costs. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order, Accuray bears the cost, but if it's less than six months, the Distributor bears the cost. The inconsistency arises because the 'at least six months' clause is vague. Does it mean exactly six months or more than six months? This lack of clarity leads to potential disputes.",

        "section": "3.6. Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section specifies that the Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. However, Section 4.1.2 states that Accuray's standard lead time for delivery of Products is six months. If Accuray's standard lead time is already six months, requiring the purchase order six months prior to shipment date does not provide Accuray with any additional time to process the order, potentially making the six-month requirement redundant or impossible to fulfill if any delays occur.",

A wire transfer made in advance of the date payment is due, made in U.S. dollars, to a bank selected by Accuray, according to the following schedule:\n5.4.1.2.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and\n5.4.1.2.2. The remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the payment schedule for System purchases via wire transfer. A contradiction arises between the initial deposit and the final payment. The deposit must be made upon acceptance of the Purchase Order, four months prior to shipment. However, the remaining balance is only due 30 days AFTER delivery. This creates a significant gap in payment timing, where Accuray is expected to ship the product with only a fraction of the payment received, increasing their financial risk.",

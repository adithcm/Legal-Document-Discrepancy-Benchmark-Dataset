        "section": "CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "This section provides a remedy for the consultant if the product is not suitable, allowing Adams Golf to either supply a suitable product or terminate the agreement. If the agreement is terminated, the compensation is prorated and repaid according to paragraph 8A. However, paragraph 8A outlines a repayment schedule for when the consultant does not play enough tournaments. Applying this repayment schedule in the case of product unsuitability creates an in-text contradiction and structural flaw, as it doesn't logically fit the scenario.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.\nC.In the event that CONSULTANT is prevented from competing for reasons outside his control, the parties agree to a good faith attempt to resolve the issues. If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "Section 8 outlines the minimum number of tournaments the consultant must play and a repayment schedule if this number is not met. Subsection C states that if the consultant is prevented from competing due to reasons outside of their control, the parties will attempt to resolve the issue. However, if no resolution is reached, ADAMS GOLF can demand prorated repayment according to 8A. This creates a contradiction because repayment is being demanded for reasons outside of the consultant's control, which seems inequitable and could be argued against, creating ambiguity in text.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section allows ADAMS GOLF to terminate the agreement if the consultant dies or is unable to play golf, requiring repayment for the unperformed period calculated according to paragraph 8A. This creates an in-text contradiction and structural flaw because paragraph 8A outlines a repayment schedule for when the consultant does not play enough tournaments, but there is no similar action happening in this case. Applying this repayment schedule in the case of death or inability to play creates ambiguity as it does not logically fit the scenario.",

        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a discrepancy by stating that 'either party' can terminate the agreement if the launch date is not met within 4 months, BUT clarifies the termination right extends ONLY to the party that demonstrated 'good faith and reasonable development efforts.' This creates an ambiguity in text because the first sentance says 'either party' but the second sentance clarifies that only one party can actually terminate it. This is a discrepancy.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory because it states that the agreement can be renewed by 'mutual written agreement', but then goes on to say that if 'either party' does not give notice of non-renewal, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates a contradiction as one statement says that it requires an agreement, while the other says if you don't do anything then it will be renewed.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' introduces ambiguity and potentially misaligns legal concepts. Indemnification typically arises from the actions of the Indemnifying Party, not based on whether the Indemnified Party is considered a 'principal'. This could be interpreted differently depending on the legal context, potentially conflicting with standard indemnification practices. Furthermore, it fails to define what it means to be 'deemed a principal'.",

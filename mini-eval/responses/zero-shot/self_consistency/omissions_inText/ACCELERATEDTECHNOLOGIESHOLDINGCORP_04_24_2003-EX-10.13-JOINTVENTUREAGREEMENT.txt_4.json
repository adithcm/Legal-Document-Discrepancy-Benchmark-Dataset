        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines that Joint Venturers are not entitled to compensation for services rendered but are reimbursed for direct expenses. However, it also states that either Joint Venturer has the authority to execute instruments relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture. This is an ambiguity, because it is not specific enough. There is not enough information about what type of instruments can be executed and what those instruments entail.",

The phrase \"as needed\" does not define what circumstances necessitate a capital contribution, how the amount is determined, or the procedure for requesting and making such contributions. This ambiguity could lead to disputes regarding the obligation to contribute capital.",

        "explanation": "This section provides a list of what expenses shall be included when regarding direct costs, but it also adds \"if the business of the Joint Venture requires additional office facilities than those now presently maintained by each Joint Venturer, such item shall be paid by the Joint Venture.\" The use of the word \"shall\" creates a contradiction, because there is no information on who is in charge of these costs.",

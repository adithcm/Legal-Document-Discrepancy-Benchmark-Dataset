        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section discusses repayment based on failing to play a 'minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events' but later refers to repayment 'for each event under [*****] achieved'. It is unclear if 'minimum of [* ****]' is the same number as '[*****]'. If the numbers are different, the section is logically inconsistent and creates an in-text contradiction. If they are the same, the language is still misaligned as it is using different wording to explain the same variable.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section requires repayment from the CONSULTANT or their estate if the agreement is terminated due to death or inability to play. It refers to Section 8A for calculating the repayment amount. However, Section 8A details repayment from the CONSULTANT to Adams Golf if the CONSULTANT fails to meet a minimum number of tournaments played; it is about *underperformance*, not *non-performance* due to death or disability. The reference to Section 8A creates an in-text contradiction as the method described in 8A is not logically applicable to the scenario described in Section 22.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Section 23 stipulates that if Adams Golf terminates the contract due to a breach by the Consultant, the consultant must repay Adams Golf. It then references Section 8A for the repayment calculation, which is a repayment schedule if the consultant does not play in enough tournaments. However, if the contract is terminated due to a breach by the consultant, this does not necessarily mean that the consultant has not played in enough tournaments. It could be due to the consultant committing any public act that involves moral turpitude. Section 8A would not be applicable in a case like that, causing a contradiction.",

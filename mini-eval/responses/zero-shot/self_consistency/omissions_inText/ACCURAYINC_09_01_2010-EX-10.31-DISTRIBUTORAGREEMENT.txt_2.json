        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The initial portion of Section 2.3.3 states that Accuray's failure to respond to a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, the subsequent sentence states that a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. The contradiction lies in the fact that the first part implies automatic rejection after two weeks of no response, while the second part suggests that acceptance requires explicit execution/approval. This creates ambiguity as to whether a non-response after two weeks is definitively a rejection.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents conflicting information regarding who bears the supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery. The text states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, Accuray bears the costs. However, it also states that if the delivery deadline is less than six months after the submission, the Distributor bears the costs. This leads to confusion about the exact condition under which Accuray is responsible for these costs.",

        "section": "5.4.1.2. Wire Transfer. A wire transfer made in advance of the date payment is due, made in U.S. dollars, to a bank selected by Accuray, according to the following schedule: 5.4.1.2.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 13 5.4.1.2.2. The remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.",
        "explanation": "The discrepancy arises because Section 5.4.1.2.1 mandates a $100,000 payment upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, at least four months before the proposed shipment date. Section 5.4.1.2.2 states that the remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery, with no mention of the timing for payment of the remainder of the balance. This creates an inconsistency in payment schedule.",

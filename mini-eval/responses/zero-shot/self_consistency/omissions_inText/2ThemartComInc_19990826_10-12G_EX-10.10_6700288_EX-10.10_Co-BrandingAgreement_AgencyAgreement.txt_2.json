        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity. It states that if the Launch Date does not occur within 4 months of the effective date, either party may terminate. However, it then states that *only* the party that used good faith and reasonable development efforts may terminate. This creates two options, and then takes away the option for one of the parties, making it contradictory.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal process. First, it states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement. Then, it says that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates two different renewal processes that contradict each other.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party' is ambiguous. It's unclear what it means for the Indemnified Party to be 'deemed a principal' of the Indemnifying Party, especially given the independent contractor relationship established in Section 12.5. This creates ambiguity in the scope of the indemnity obligation.",

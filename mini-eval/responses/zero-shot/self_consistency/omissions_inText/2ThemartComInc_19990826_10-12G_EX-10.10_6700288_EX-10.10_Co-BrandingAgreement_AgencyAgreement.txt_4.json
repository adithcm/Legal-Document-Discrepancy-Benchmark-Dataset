        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction. The first sentence states that each party shall use good faith. The second sentence states that IF after using such efforts the launch date has not occurred in 4 months, either party can terminate the agreement by providing written notice. The third sentence creates a loophole, if only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate. This section is ambiguous. Either party can terminate after 4 months if efforts were made, but only the party who used good faith can terminate. Which is it? Does it require both parties to not act in good faith to terminate?",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency. The agreement is renewed for a successive one (1) year term if both parties agree and sign a written agreement. Then the document contradicts itself and states, in the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year. This means if there is no notification, it is automatically renewed. However, the begining of the section states both parties have to come to an agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section includes ambiguity in text. This section is regarding an Indemnifying Party, however the section refers to the indemifying party as being responsible for acts, ommisions, or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. This does not make sense as there is no way for the Indemnified party to be deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. It would make more sense if it stated that the Indemnifying party acts as a principal of the Indemnified Party. ",

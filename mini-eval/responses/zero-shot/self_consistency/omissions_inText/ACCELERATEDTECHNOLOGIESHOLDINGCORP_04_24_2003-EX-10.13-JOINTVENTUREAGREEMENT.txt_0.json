        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it doesn't specify how the need for capital contributions will be determined, who decides the amount, or what happens if a Joint Venturer fails to contribute when required. The term 'as needed' lacks a clear definition or procedure, making it difficult to enforce and potentially leading to disputes.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "While granting authority to either Joint Venturer to execute instruments, it doesn't specify any limitations or requirements for such execution. This could lead to one Joint Venturer acting against the interests of the other or the Joint Venture itself, without any clear contractual recourse. This is misaligned because one party could use their power against the other in the contract.",

        "section": "The fiscal year of the Joint Venture shall be the calendar year, and shall use the cash basis of accounting. If requested by a Joint Venturer, the Joint Venture books and records shall be audited as of the close of each year by an independent accountant acceptable to both Joint Venturers.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a structural flaw. While it mandates a calendar year and cash basis accounting, it only allows for an audit 'if requested'. This implies that an audit is not a mandatory procedure, potentially leaving the Joint Venture vulnerable to financial mismanagement or disputes. Standard accounting practices typically involve annual audits, particularly in ventures of this nature. The section could have been written better to emphasize the importance of a audit and that if one party requests it, it must be done.",

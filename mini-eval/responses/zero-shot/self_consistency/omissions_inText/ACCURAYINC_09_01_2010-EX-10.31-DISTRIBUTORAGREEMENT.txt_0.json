The following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning: 1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date). 1.2. \"Customer\" means any person or business entity with whom Distributor enters into an agreement for Products or Services pursuant to this Agreement. 1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates. 1.4. \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" means a purchase. 1.5. \"Multi-Modality Purchase\" means the purchase, on a single purchase order, of at least one Distributor imaging product. 1.6. \"Multiple LINAC Purchase\" means the purchase, on a single purchase order, of at least one Distributor linear accelerator product. 1.7. \"Product(s)\" means related products manufactured by or for Accuray for use in the radiosurgery market. 1.8. \"Quote\" means a quote provided by Accuray to Distributor pursuant to Section 2.3 that will serve as the basis for the Product configuration. 1.9. \"Service(s)\" means the performance of services by Accuray or its distributors. 1.10. \"Service Agreements\" means the Accuray CyberKnife Service Agreement. 1.11. \"Spare Parts\" means replacement or additional parts or Products. 1.12. \"Specification(s)\" means the current written description of a Product or Service. 1.13. \"System(s)\" means the Accuray CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System",
        "explanation": "Definition 1.4 defines \"Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase\" as \"a purchase.\" This definition is overly broad and does not provide any specific meaning to the term. It is not clear what kind of purchase it is referring to.",

        "section": "4.5. Import License. Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer.",
        "explanation": "This section imposes obligations on both Accuray and Distributor regarding import licenses, contingent on Accuray's presence in the customer's country. The second half of the sentence beginning with \"provided, however\" shifts the import license and importer of record obligations to the Distributor under certain conditions, but only if the Distributor consents. The distributor's consent does not negate their responsibilities based on geography but rather on Accuray's presence and that creates an ambiguity.",

        "section": "4.6. Warranty. 4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray. \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable. In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.",
        "explanation": "This clause contains both a warranty and a disclaimer of warranty. It's standard practice to include both, but they must be carefully worded to avoid contradictions. The initial sentences describe the scope of Accuray's warranty, while the latter part disclaims all other warranties. If the initial warranty is not carefully defined, the disclaimer could potentially negate the intended scope of the warranty, leading to disputes over what is actually covered.",

Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent. 10.2. Products Liability Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement is unsafe, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "Sections 10.1 and 10.2 each state that \"Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.\" However, both sections also state that Distributor must give Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim. This creates a contradiction: If Accuray has sole control, Distributor would not be entering into any settlement or compromise independently. The second sentence is therefore unnecessary and potentially confusing.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section regarding supplementary shipping costs is contradictory. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission, Accuray bears the expedited delivery expenses. However, the example then states that if a purchase order is submitted on June 1 with a delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months), Accuray covers the expenses, but if the delivery date is October 1 (less than six months), the Distributor covers the expenses. The contradiction lies in whether 'at least six months' includes exactly six months or strictly more than six months. This ambiguity can lead to disputes over who is responsible for expedited shipping costs.",

        "section": "3.6. Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "Section 3.6 outlines that the Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. However, Section 4.1.2 states that Accuray will bear supplementary shipping costs if the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order was at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order by the Distributor. The misalignment here arises if the Distributor, in adhering to Section 3.6, submits a purchase order exactly six months prior to the shipment date. If Accuray then requires expedited shipping to meet this 'at least six months' deadline, it's unclear whether Accuray or the Distributor bears the cost. This lack of clarity creates potential for disputes and contradictions in interpreting the financial obligations.",

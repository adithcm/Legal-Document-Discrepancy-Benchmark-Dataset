        "section": "Affiliates who use this program to apply for credit cards for their own use are NOT in violation of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the general intention of the agreement, which is for commercial use and generating approved accounts through affiliate links. It creates an exception that undermines the purpose of the affiliate program, potentially allowing affiliates to benefit personally without driving external customer acquisition.",

All use of the Marks by Affiliate is limited solely to the use contemplated by this Agreement. All use of Chase Marks by Affiliate is subject to the prior written approval of Chase.",
        "explanation": "This section first states that all use of Chase Marks by the Affiliate is limited to the use 'contemplated by this Agreement.' Then, it adds that 'all use of Chase Marks by Affiliate is subject to the prior written approval of Chase.' This creates an ambiguity: Does using the marks as 'contemplated by this Agreement' automatically imply approval, or is separate written approval always required, even for uses that fall within the agreement's original intent? This overlap and potential redundancy introduces confusion.",

        "explanation": "While Chase reserves the right to change the agreement, stating that changes can occur 'without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website' is contradictory. Posting information on the Chase Website *is* a form of notice. The phrase 'without notice' is therefore inaccurate and creates confusion.",

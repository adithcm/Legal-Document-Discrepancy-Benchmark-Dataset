        "section": "Effective one week from the 1 Launch Date, eDiets shall include a back button to the Women.com Site on all pages of the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page. If at any time during the Term of this Agreement, eDiets reasonably believes that the inclusion of such back buttons has a material negative effect upon the rate at which users of the Diet Center register to become members of eDiets or convert into registered participants of the services offered by eDiets on the Diet Center (the \"Negative Effect\"), eDiets may conduct a one (1) month test of the effect of such back buttons which may include the exclusion of the back button. If such test verifies the Negative Effect of the back button(s) to the Women.com Site, eDiets may remove any such back buttons.",
        "explanation": "This section allows eDiets to remove the back button if it has a 'Negative Effect' on registration/conversion rates. However, it doesn't define a clear metric for determining a 'material negative effect.' This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether the effect is significant enough to warrant removal of the back button. What percentage decrease in registration or conversion would be considered 'material'?",

        "section": "3.1 Advertising and Promotion. Advertising and Promotion. Women.com shall make available to eDiets and eDiets shall purchase from Women.com advertising and promotional inventory in the amounts and at the rates specified in Exhibit B hereto and in accordance with the terms specified in Exhibit D hereto. If Women.com does not deliver at least 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Advertsing Promotions as set forth on Exhibit B (11,250,000 per quarter 45,000,000 per year) 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for the Diet Center Logo as set forth on Exhibit B (3,250,000 per quarter 13,000,000 per year) and 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Other Campaigns as set forth on Exhibit B (3,000,000 per quarter 12,000,000 per year) each quarter following the Launch Date, within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, Women.com shall deliver an amount equal to the under-delivery within the same campaign elements, including newsletters, promotions, exclusive sponsorships, targeted rotations, ROS, channel and sub-channel center logo placements, or mutually agreed upon comparable elements.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the consequences if Women.com fails to deliver the guaranteed impressions. It states that Women.com must deliver the under-delivered amount within sixty (60) days. However, later in the paragraph, it mentions a 'Make Good Period' which is 'an extended number of days to be mutually agreed upon by the parties.' This creates a contradiction. Is the under-delivery to be made good within 60 days, or within a mutually agreed upon extended period?",

        "explanation": "This section requires eDiets to include a mention of Women.com in its newsletter, and that Women.com needs to approve it. However, it also states that 'eDiets shall determine in its sole discretion the placement, frequency and timing of such Mention'. If eDiets determines the frequency in its sole discretion, does it need to include the mention at all? This is an ambiguity in the text.",

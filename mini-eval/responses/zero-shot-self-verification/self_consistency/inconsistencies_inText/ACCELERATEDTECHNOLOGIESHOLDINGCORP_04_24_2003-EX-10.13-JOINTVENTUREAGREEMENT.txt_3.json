        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture. ... It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture shall be made.",
        "explanation": "This section grants each Joint Venturer full authority over the Joint Venture's affairs but then immediately restricts this authority by requiring mutual consent for key financial decisions. This creates an ambiguity as to the extent of each venturer's individual power and could lead to disputes about decision-making authority.",

        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section states that distributions can only be made if assets exceed liabilities, implying profitability is necessary. However, it then guarantees PVSS a payment of $10,000 per month regardless of profitability. This creates a contradiction: if the venture is not profitable and liabilities exceed assets, how can PVSS still receive the guaranteed payment without violating the initial distribution restriction?",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section details the procedure for asset distribution upon termination, stating that if parties cannot agree on an asset's value, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. has the final say. This potentially contradicts the earlier statements about both Joint Venturers having full authority and requiring mutual consent for key decisions (Section 5), as it gives one party unilateral control over a crucial aspect of the liquidation process.",

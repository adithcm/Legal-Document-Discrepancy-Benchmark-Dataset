        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement is structurally flawed because it does not clearly state what happens if the Joint Venturers do agree to make a capital contribution. It only addresses the scenario where they do not. The missing information creates an ambiguity about the procedure, amounts, and consequences of agreed-upon capital contributions.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the Joint Venturers will not receive compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture but will be reimbursed for direct expenses. It omits a clear definition of 'services rendered' versus 'direct expenses.' This omission leads to potential disputes, as it is unclear whether certain activities would qualify as uncompensated 'services' or reimbursable 'expenses.' This is a Structural Flaw because it does not clarify what is considered a service and what is an expense.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "The clause stating \"However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value\" introduces an inconsistency. While the agreement generally stipulates a 50/50 split of income, losses, and assets, this clause gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. unilateral power to determine the value of assets during liquidation, which could potentially disadvantage Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. and contradict the intended equal distribution.",

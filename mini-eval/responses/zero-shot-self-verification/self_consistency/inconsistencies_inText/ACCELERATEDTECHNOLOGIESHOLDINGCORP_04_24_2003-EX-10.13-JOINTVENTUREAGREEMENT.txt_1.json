        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section doesn't define what happens if mutual consent is not reached. It creates ambiguity regarding the initial funding of the Joint Venture and allows potential disputes in how the joint venture will operate in the beginning.",

        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction. It states that distributions can only be made if assets exceed liabilities and then immediately states PVSS is entitled to a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month regardless of profitability. If the Joint Venture has more liabilities than assets, a distribution should not be made, but this clause forces a distribution, creating an internal conflict.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an imbalance of power during liquidation. While the parties are supposed to agree on a price for assets that cannot be divided, it ultimately gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. the final say on the asset's value if there is a disagreement. This could lead to an unfair distribution of assets.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "While the Joint Venturers are not entitled to compensation for services, they are reimbursed for 'all direct expenses'. This creates ambiguity as it does not specify what 'direct expenses' entails, potentially leading to disputes over what expenses are reimbursable.",

However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "This section allows for termination with 60 days' notice, which could potentially occur within the initial term (before February 28, 2004). However, it also states the agreement is effective *until* February 28, 2004, creating a contradiction. Can the agreement be terminated *before* the end date, or does the 'effective until' clause override the termination clause?",

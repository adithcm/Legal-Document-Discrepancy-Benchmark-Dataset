        "section": "The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This clause allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow without requiring i-Escrow's consent. This is a significant shift in financial obligation and could be deemed unfair or unconscionable, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contract law. The immediate effectiveness of the adjusted rate, without a reasonable notice period or opportunity for i-Escrow to negotiate, further exacerbates this concern.",

        "section": "In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal at least thirty days before the expiration date, the agreement automatically renews for another year. This creates a contradiction, as it implies that lack of action leads to renewal, differing from standard contract renewal practices which require explicit consent.",

        "explanation": "This statement is contradictory. Sections 9 (Indemnity), 10 (Limitation on Liability), and 11 (Confidential Information) typically contain clauses that should survive termination to protect the parties' interests even after the agreement ends. Excluding these sections from survival creates significant risk and may not reflect the intended outcome, particularly concerning potential liabilities and confidentiality obligations that may extend beyond the agreement's term.",

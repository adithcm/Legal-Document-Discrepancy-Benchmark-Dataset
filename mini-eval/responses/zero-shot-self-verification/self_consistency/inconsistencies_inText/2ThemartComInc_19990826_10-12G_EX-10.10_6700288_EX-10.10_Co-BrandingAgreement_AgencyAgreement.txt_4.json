        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "2TheMart has the power to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees, which means that i-Escrow has no control over a key financial term of the agreement. This creates an imbalance of power and potentially exposes i-Escrow to unpredictable financial obligations.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence of this section creates a contradiction. It states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before expiration, the agreement is *automatically* renewed. This conflicts with the earlier statement that renewal requires *mutual written agreement*.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph contains a contradiction. The initial part of the paragraph states that Section 8.5 does not survive expiration or termination. However, the first sentence of Section 8.5 describes the effects of termination, therefore, it needs to survive termination. The last sentence contradicts the need for this whole section to be here in the first place.",

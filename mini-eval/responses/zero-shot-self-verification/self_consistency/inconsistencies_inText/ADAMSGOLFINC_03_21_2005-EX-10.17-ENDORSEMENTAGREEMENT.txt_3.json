        "explanation": "This section creates an exception to the exclusivity clauses (4A, 4B, 4C) but is vague. It is unclear what type of ads CONSULTANT does not have to wear ADAMS GOLF apparel in. This creates ambiguity about the extent of the endorsement and the circumstances under which CONSULTANT is not obligated to promote ADAMS GOLF.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'satisfactory record of play' is ambiguous. Without a clear definition, it's difficult to determine whether CONSULTANT has met his obligations, leading to potential disputes over repayment.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination for cause. It states that CONSULTANT must repay ADAMS GOLF for the period not performed unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product. The discrepancy lies in the phrase 'adequate product as outlined in section 17A'. Section 17A only states that ADAMS GOLF will supply enough product to CONSULTANT and that ADAMS GOLF will pay for delivery. There is no mention of what is deemed as adequate. This causes there to be conflicting interpretations and could lead to legal issues.",

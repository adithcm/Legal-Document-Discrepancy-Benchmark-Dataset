        "section": "Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "This statement says that if Accuray fails to respond to a Purchase Order within two weeks, it is considered disapproved. This could lead to a misunderstanding, if Siemens assumes the Purchase Order is accepted after two weeks of no response, but it is actually considered disapproved.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the Purchase order must be sent 6 months prior to the expected shipment date, but section 4.1.2 states that if a purchase order is submitted 6 months prior to the shipment date and supplementary shipping costs are needed, then Accuray is expected to pay for it. This can cause a contradiction, because, in section 4.1.2, it is implying that the Purchase order can be sent less than 6 months prior to the shipment date.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the \"Terms of Payment and Related Matters\". By stating that Section 2.2 survives termination, it implies that payment terms continue even after the agreement ends. However, the agreement also stipulates that upon termination, the Provider must repay fees for services not yet provided (Section 3.6(e)). This creates an inconsistency: If the agreement is terminated, are payments still due according to the original schedule (Section 2.2), or is there a pro-rata refund (Section 3.6(e))?",

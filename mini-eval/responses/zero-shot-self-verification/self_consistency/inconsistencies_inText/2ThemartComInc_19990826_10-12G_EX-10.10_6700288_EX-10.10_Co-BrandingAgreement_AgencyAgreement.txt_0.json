        "section": "The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This clause allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees without i-Escrow's consent. This creates a potential imbalance of power, as 2TheMart could increase the fees significantly, impacting i-Escrow's profitability without any negotiation. The lack of a cap on the Adjusted Rate or any mechanism for i-Escrow to contest the adjustment creates ambiguity regarding the financial obligations of i-Escrow and could be deemed unconscionable under contract law.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It first states that renewal requires mutual written agreement, but then adds that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual requirements for renewal.",

        "section": "Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing.",
        "explanation": "This section seems to imply that Accuray's indemnity obligation only applies to patent infringements in the United States, Germany, or the country where the customer requested delivery. This limitation could be problematic because intellectual property rights are territorial, and infringement could occur in other countries where the product is sold or used. This creates an ambiguity as to whether Accuray's indemnity extends to countries beyond those specifically mentioned.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding Section 10.1, the foregoing states the entire liability of Accuray with respect to infringement of patents or other proprietary rights by the Products or part thereof, or by their operation. To remove all doubt, Accuray has no obligation regarding any claim based on any of the following: (a) modification of the Products by any person other than Accuray; (b) combination, operation or use of the Products with other products, parts, components, materials or accessories not provided by Accuray; or (c) infringement by a product not manufactured by Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This clause limits Accuray's liability regarding infringement claims, particularly excluding obligations for claims based on modifications, combinations with non-Accuray products, or products not manufactured by Accuray. This could be problematic if the distributor is compelled to modify a product by the customer due to country specific laws that Accuray is not aware of. This limitation may need to be clearly understood and accepted by the distributor.",

Such upgrades will be available at the prices listed in the then current price list as of the date of the Quote (unless prior written approval by Accuray for application of an earlier price list is obtained) for the upgrade, less any applicable discounts as specified in Exhibit A hereto.",
        "explanation": "This section states that upgrades can be purchased at the distributor's discretion, and the price is based on the current price list at the time of the quote. However, it also allows for the possibility of using an earlier price list with Accuray's approval. The potential contradiction lies in the fact that it does not specify the conditions under which Accuray would approve the use of an earlier price list, creating uncertainty.",

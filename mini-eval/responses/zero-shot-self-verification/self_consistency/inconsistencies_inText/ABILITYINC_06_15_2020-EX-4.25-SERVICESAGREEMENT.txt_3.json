(c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states the information about employees should be on Exhibit A but the rest of the section states provider can't change representatives without consent. This implies that the list of representatives can be modified later, which contradicts the beginning of the agreement.",

Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "This section contains ambiguity in legal terms. The phrase 'relating to/arising out of or resulting from' is vague and could lead to multiple interpretations regarding the scope of indemnification. It's unclear whether 'relating to' implies a direct connection or a looser association, potentially creating disputes about what falls under the indemnification obligation.",

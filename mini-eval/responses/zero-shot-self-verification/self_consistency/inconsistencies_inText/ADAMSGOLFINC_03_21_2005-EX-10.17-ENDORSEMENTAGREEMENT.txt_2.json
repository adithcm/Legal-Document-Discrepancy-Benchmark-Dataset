        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section states that the consultant must exclusively use mandatory products from Adams Golf, but then allows for the consultant to use clubs, including a putter, from other manufacturers, as long as they do not endorse them. This creates an in-text contradiction because if they are using the product, and are a famous endorser, they are still, in essence, endorsing the product.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification.",
        "explanation": "Section 8A requires the consultant to achieve a 'satisfactory record of play' in a minimum number of events, but there is no clear definition as to what 'satisfactory record of play' means, this creates ambiguity. Furthermore, Section 8B then dictates that payment must be made within one month following the end of the calendar year, but payment may be delayed for up to 90 days with written notification. This is an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.\n23. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Section 22 states that if the consultant is unable to play golf, Adams Golf may terminate the agreement and that the consultant shall be required to repay Adams Golf for the period not performed, but states that no repayment is required if the reason is due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event. Section 23 then states that if either party breaches the contract, the other party may terminate the agreement, and the consultant shall be required to repay Adams Golf for the period not performed, unless the termination is due to Adams Golf consistently failing to provide adequate product. These create an in-text contradiction.",

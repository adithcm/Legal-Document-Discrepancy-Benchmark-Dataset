FAILURE TO PLAY\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",

It states that if the inability is due to an injury during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment is required. However, it also states that upon termination, the consultant or their estate shall repay ADAMS GOLF for the period not performed. This is contradictory. The first part waives repayment in the case of injury during a promotional event, but the second part mandates repayment regardless. There is ambiguity about whether to repay.",

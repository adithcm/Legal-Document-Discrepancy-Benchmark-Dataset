The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****].

The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "Section 4 outlines exclusivity of the endorsement. However, section D has loopholes allowing the consultant to endorse and play with the [*****] product under certain condidtions. This can cause confusion since the first sentence states that consultant is entitled to endorse and play the product. This is ambigious in text.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph outlines the consultant's obligation to play in a minimum number of events. If the minimum is not met, there's a repayment schedule. Subparagraph B requires payment within one month following the end of the calendar year, but then allows for a 90-day delay with written notification under 'extenuating circumstances'. The definition of extenuating circumstances is not defined, this can cause ambigious situations.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph outlines the conditions under which ADAMS GOLF can terminate the agreement if the consultant dies or is unable to play. It also stipulates that if the inability to play is due to an injury during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment is required. However, the paragraph also states that if the agreement is terminated, the consultant or their estate must repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period of the agreement. This is a contradiction because it first states no repayment is required due to injury at the event, then says repayment is required after termination.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section allows the consultant to use clubs from other manufacturers, specifically a putter, but prohibits endorsing those clubs. However, Section 3 grants Adams Golf the exclusive right to use the consultant's endorsement in connection with the product. If the consultant uses a non-Adams Golf putter, even without explicitly endorsing it, it could be argued that his implicit association with that product constitutes a violation of Adams Golf's exclusive endorsement rights, creating an ambiguity.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination due to the consultant's inability to play and specifies repayment is required for the unperformed portion of the agreement, calculated as per paragraph 8A, except if the inability to play is due to an injury at an Adams Golf promotional event. The phrase 'Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT' contradicts the previous statment saying 'However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required.'",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'meet as reasonably requested with ADAMS GOLF'S Design/Testing Teams' lacks a specific definition of what constitutes a 'reasonable request'. This ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce the consultant's obligation to meet, as there's no clear standard to determine if a request is genuinely reasonable or excessively burdensome. This section is vague and does not make sense. ",

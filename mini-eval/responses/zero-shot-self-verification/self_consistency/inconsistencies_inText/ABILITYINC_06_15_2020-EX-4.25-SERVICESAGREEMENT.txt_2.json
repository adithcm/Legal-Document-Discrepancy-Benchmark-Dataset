        "explanation": "The text is ambiguous in legal terms because it encompasses 'any invention...solely or jointly by Provider while working for or on behalf of the Recipient, which relate to, is suggested by, or results from the Services.' This is a broad statement that means that anything that the provider comes up with that has to do with the services, the recipent owns. This is a vague statement and hard to enforce under state or national law because what if the services is marketing and the provider comes up with a marketing strategy outside of work, the recipient owns that.",

        "explanation": "There is an omission in the text. Section 3.6 outlines obligations of the provider upon termination. By stating that 'all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate' except certain sections, there is a contradiction because Section 3.6 contains obligations that should survive termination, but it's not explicitly stated as an exception. This creates an internal contradiction.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The clause stating that 2TheMart can unilaterally adjust the advertising fees without i-Escrow's consent creates a significant imbalance in the agreement. This gives 2TheMart the power to arbitrarily increase the fees, potentially making the agreement financially unviable for i-Escrow. This lacks fairness and could be deemed unconscionable.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The section regarding renewal contains contradictory statements. It states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement' but then adds 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' This creates ambiguity. Does the contract renew automatically if no notice is given, or does it require a mutual written agreement? These two statements contradict each other. One implies action is required to renew (mutual agreement), while the other implies inaction leads to renewal (automatic renewal if no notice is given).",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an internal contradiction regarding which sections survive termination. The primary statement is that *all* rights granted herein shall terminate. Then the contract states, 'all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination'. However, it then says 'Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.' This creates confusion as to what parts of the agreement are still active after termination. Section 8.5 is listed as not surviving termination, but is also needed to address the effects of termination, and may cause legal issues.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if Accuray fails to approve or disapprove a Purchase Order within two weeks, it constitutes disapproval. However, the following sentence says 'Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.' This sentence contradicts the previous one by implying that acceptance requires explicit execution by Accuray, creating ambiguity about whether a lack of response constitutes acceptance or rejection.",

Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance.",
        "explanation": "The text is not structured correctly. The paragraph starts talking about shipments then all of a sudden starts talking about insurance, which has nothing to do with shipments.",

A wire transfer made in advance of the date payment is due, made in U.S. dollars, to a bank selected by Accuray, according to the following schedule:\n5.4.1.2.2. The remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.",
        "explanation": "This creates an ambiguity regarding the payment schedule. The section specifies that the wire transfer should be made *in advance* of the due date. However, section 5.4.1.2.2 states that the remaining balance is due net 30 days *after* delivery, implying the payment is made after the service/product has been provided. This is an in-text contradiction.",

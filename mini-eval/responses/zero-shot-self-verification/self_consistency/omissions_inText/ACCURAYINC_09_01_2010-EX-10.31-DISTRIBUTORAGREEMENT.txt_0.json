        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The last two sentences of this section appear to contradict each other. The second to last sentence states that if the Purchase order was submitted 6 months prior to delivery date, then Accuray is responsible for any expenses. While the last sentence states that if the purchase order was not submitted 6 months prior to the delivery date, then the distributor is responsible for any expenses. This is considered contradictory and can lead to confusion.",

An irrevocable trade finance letter of credit issued by Distributor's bank, confirmed by a bank designated by Accuray in all respects and delivered to Accuray upon the acceptance of the Purchase Order by Accuray. The letter of credit will provide that Accuray can draw against the letter of credit according to the following schedule: 5.4.1.1.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 5.4.1.1.2. Balance upon presentation of documents by Accuray evidencing shipment of the Products to Distributor or Customer as designated in the Purchase Order.",
        "explanation": "Section 5.4.1.1.1 states that the $100,000 is non-refundable but automatically applied to the Distributor's next purchase if the Purchase Order is cancelled. This is contradictory because it's technically non-refundable since it's going towards another purchase.",

        "explanation": "This entire agreement clause states that in the event of a contradiction between this agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement, the terms of this agreement shall prevail. However, earlier in the document, specifically in section 2.1, the document states that capitalized terms used but not defined in this agreement shall have the meaning provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement. This sets up a structural flaw because the document later mentions that in the event of a contradiction, this agreement shall prevail, despite using definitions within the Strategic Alliance Agreement.",

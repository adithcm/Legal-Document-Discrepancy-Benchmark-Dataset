        "section": "The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The Term of Contract contains bracketed asterisks and blank months/days. This does not clearly state when the contract ends and thus creates an in-text contradiction because there is no end date listed. If the end date is not known, it makes it hard to ensure the contract is being followed.",

        "section": "It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "If the contract is terminated in section 7, the payment schedule refers to 8A. But 8A applies to the Minimum Number of Tournaments. The inconsistency in repayment structures between product unsuitability and failure to meet tournament minimums creates ambiguity regarding how compensation will be prorated, leading to potential disputes. A more precise description of how to determine proration should be mentioned.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "In the event of the CONSULTANT dying, the estate would have to pay ADAMS GOLF based on 8A. This section refers to how much CONSULTANT is required to play, this does not translate to the CONSULTANT's death. There is no logical way to prorate in this scenario. ",

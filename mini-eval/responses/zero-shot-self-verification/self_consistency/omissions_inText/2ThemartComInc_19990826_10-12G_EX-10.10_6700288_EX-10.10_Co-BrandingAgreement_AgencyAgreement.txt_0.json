        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the term and renewal process of the agreement. It states that the agreement is automatically renewed for another year if neither party provides a 30-day notice of non-renewal. However, it also states that the agreement may be renewed for successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties. These are contradictory statements.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "The section refers to section 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], however Section 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS] does not have any instances where this agreement can be terminated. Thus it is a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The statement specifies that the Indemnifying Party will cover costs for claims arising from their actions to the extent the Indemnified Party is deemed a 'principal' of the Indemnifying Party. However, section 12.5 states that The parties are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee- employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. This causes a contradiction as the indemnifying party can not be a principal if the agreement states that the parties are independent contractors.",

In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines that if the Launch Date doesn't occur within 4 months of the Effective Date, either party can terminate the agreement, BUT it follows this statement by saying ONLY the party that used good faith efforts can terminate the agreement, which causes confusion.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The section states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then follows that statement by saying that if a party does not give notice of non-renewal, the term will automatically be renewed, which is contradictory.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party\" is ambiguous and could create issues of interpretation. Indemnification is typically for actions of the indemnifying party, not based on a principal-agent relationship. This is a structural flaw.",

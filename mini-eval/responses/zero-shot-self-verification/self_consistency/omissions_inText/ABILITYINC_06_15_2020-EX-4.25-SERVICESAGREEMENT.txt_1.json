        "section": "This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",
        "explanation": "The sentence is a structural flaw because the sentence does not make sense. The sentence starts with 'This Agreement be deemed effective' and then includes the word 'Agreement' again, which disrupts the sentence's flow and meaning. The sentence attempts to state the agreement's effective date and termination date, but the structural flaw makes it difficult to understand clearly.",

        "section": "Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause, and without liability except, in the case of the Recipient, for required payment for services rendered and reimbursement for authorized expenses incurred, by providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "The language around the termination conditions is ambiguously worded, particularly concerning the Recipient's liability. While it states termination can occur 'without liability,' it then carves out an exception for 'required payment for services rendered and reimbursement for authorized expenses incurred.' This creates ambiguity. It's unclear if the Recipient is liable only for services fully completed before the 90-day notice period ends, or also for services partially rendered during that notice period. This could lead to disputes over payment obligations upon termination.",

        "section": "Recipient shall own all rights, title, and interest in any invention, technique, process, device, discovery, improvement, or know-how made by Provider which results from the Services.",
        "explanation": "The lack of clarity around the phrase 'results from the Services' creates ambiguity. It is not defined if the Recipient owns any invention, etc. that the Provider makes, even if the Provider uses their own time and resources outside of what the Recipient asked of them. This gives Recipient broad ownership rights that could be disputed. The ambiguity lies in the extent to which something 'results from' the Services, leading to potential disagreements about intellectual property ownership.",

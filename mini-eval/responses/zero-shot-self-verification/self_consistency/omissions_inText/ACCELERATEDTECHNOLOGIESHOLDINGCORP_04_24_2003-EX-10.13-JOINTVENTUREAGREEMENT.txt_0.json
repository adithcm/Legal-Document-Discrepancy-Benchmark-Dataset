        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it doesn't specify how the capital contributions are determined, who decides when they are needed, or what happens if a Joint Venturer fails to contribute. The term \"as needed\" lacks a concrete definition, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes over financial obligations.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "The text states that Joint Venturers are not entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture but are reimbursed for direct expenses. However, it also states that either Joint Venturer has the authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture. This could be interpreted as providing services to the Joint Venture, creating an ambiguity regarding whether the act of executing instruments is considered a service that warrants compensation beyond expense reimbursement.",

If requested by a Joint Venturer, the Joint Venture books and records shall be audited as of the close of each year by an independent accountant acceptable to both Joint Venturers.",
        "explanation": "While stating the fiscal year will be the calendar year, it then states the Joint Venture will use the cash basis of accounting. While not strictly illegal, depending on the nature and scale of the business, using the cash basis accounting method may not accurately reflect the financial performance and position of the Joint Venture, potentially leading to misinterpretations of its financial health.",

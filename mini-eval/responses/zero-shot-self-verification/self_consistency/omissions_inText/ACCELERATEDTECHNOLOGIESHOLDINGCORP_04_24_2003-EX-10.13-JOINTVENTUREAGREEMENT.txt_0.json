        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"as needed\" is ambiguous and doesn't specify how the need is determined, who decides it, or what the process is for requesting and approving capital contributions. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over whether a capital contribution is truly needed and whether a Joint Venturer is obligated to make it.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section gives each joint venturer unilateral authority to execute any instrument relating to the joint venture. This is too broad and doesn't specify limitations on the types of instruments, the amounts involved, or the requirement for consultation with the other joint venturer. This could lead to one venturer entering into agreements that are detrimental to the joint venture without the other's knowledge or consent.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers agree and declare that this association for the carrying on of a joint venture business operation does not, and is not intended to create a partnership, for either legal or United States income tax purposes, each Party recognizing that the other is willing and able to contribute capital, labor, and services for the operation of a successful joint venture business. Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",
        "explanation": "While the intention is to avoid partnership status for tax purposes via Section 761(a) election, the language is not a guarantee and the IRS might still classify the arrangement as a partnership based on its operational characteristics, regardless of this declaration. This represents a risk because the legal consequences (liability, fiduciary duties) and tax implications of a partnership can differ significantly from those of a joint venture.",

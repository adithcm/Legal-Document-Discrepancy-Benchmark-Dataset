        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The term 'satisfactory record of play' is not clearly defined, leading to potential disputes over whether CONSULTANT has met the minimum tournament requirement. This lack of definition creates ambiguity and makes it difficult to objectively determine if the repayment clause should be triggered.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Requiring repayment from the consultant's estate in the event of death is contradictory to general legal principles. The contract implies that the estate is responsible for fulfilling the contract even after death, which is legally questionable and contradicts the impossibility of performance due to death.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "The section states that if either party commits a material breach, the other party may terminate the agreement. However, it then stipulates that upon termination, the CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the period not performed. This creates an inconsistency, as it is unclear why the CONSULTANT would need to repay ADAMS GOLF if ADAMS GOLF was the one to commit a material breach. The obligation should only be on the CONSULTANT to repay if he was the one that breached the agreement.",

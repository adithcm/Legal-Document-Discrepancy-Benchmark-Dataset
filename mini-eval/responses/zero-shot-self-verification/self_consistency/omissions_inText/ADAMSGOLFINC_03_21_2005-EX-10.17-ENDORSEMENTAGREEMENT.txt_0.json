        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "Section 8 outlines a minimum number of tournaments the consultant must play per year, and a repayment schedule if this minimum is not met. The redacted portions make it impossible to determine the exact number of tournaments required and the corresponding repayment amounts. This creates a significant ambiguity, undermining the enforceability of this clause. The example provided in Section 8.B references redacted numbers, making it impossible to fully understand the application of the repayment clause.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if the agreement is terminated due to the consultant's death or inability to play, the consultant (or their estate) must repay Adams Golf for the unperformed portion of the agreement, calculated as in section 8A. This introduces a contradiction because if the consultant dies, it is illogical and potentially unenforceable to demand repayment, as the failure to perform is due to circumstances completely outside of their control and represents a significant and unavoidable hardship.",

(It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section allows the consultant to use clubs from other manufacturers, specifically mentioning a putter, but prohibits endorsing them. The redacted portion [* ****] implies a number or a type of club, but without this information, it's unclear the full extent of the consultant's freedom to use non-Adams Golf clubs. The statement is ambiguous because it is not clear what clubs, other than the putter, can be used. This can lead to confusion and potential disagreements regarding what constitutes permissible use versus endorsement of competing products.",

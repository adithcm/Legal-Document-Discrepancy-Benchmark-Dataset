        "section": "CONSULTANT hereby gives and grants to ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right and license to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT in the CONTRACT TERRITORY.",
        "explanation": "While this grants Adams Golf the exclusive right to use the Consultant's endorsement, the term 'ENDORSEMENT' is defined very broadly in Section 2A. This broad definition, coupled with the exclusivity clause, could be interpreted to restrict the consultant's activities beyond what is reasonably necessary to protect Adams Golf's interests. It could lead to disputes about what constitutes an endorsement.",

        "section": "If CONSULTANT endorses or promotes a non-competitive product and in that endorsement or promotion CONSULTANT wears, plays, uses, holds or is in any way associated with a product that would constitute PRODUCT as defined under this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall use objectively reasonable best efforts to ensure that PRODUCT is an ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT and it shall not be altered or changed in appearance in the endorsement in any manner whatsoever without the express written consent of ADAMS GOLF. When endorsing a non-competitive product, under no circumstances shall CONSULTANT wear, play, use, hold or in any way be associated with an ADAMS GOLF competitor's Product.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'objectively reasonable best efforts' is ambiguous. What constitutes 'objectively reasonable' is open to interpretation and could lead to disputes. There are no specific metrics or guidelines defined to assess whether the consultant has met this standard. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to enforce this clause.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Requiring the consultant's estate to repay Adams Golf for the period of the agreement not performed if the consultant dies, this is too broad and potentially unconscionable. There are no limitations based on the cause of death (e.g., negligence by Adams Golf) or the circumstances surrounding the inability to play. This could result in a significant financial burden on the consultant's estate even if the inability to perform is due to factors beyond the consultant's control.",

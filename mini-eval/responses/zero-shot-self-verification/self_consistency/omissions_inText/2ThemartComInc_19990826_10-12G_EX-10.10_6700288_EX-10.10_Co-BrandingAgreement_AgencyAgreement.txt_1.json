        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding termination rights. It states that if the Launch Date is not achieved within 4 months of the Effective Date, either party may terminate the agreement. However, it then adds a condition that only the party that has used good faith and reasonable development efforts can exercise this termination right. This creates an ambiguous situation where both parties could argue they acted in good faith, making it difficult to determine who can actually terminate the agreement.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It initially states that the agreement may be renewed for successive one-year terms by mutual written agreement. However, it then states that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days before the expiration date, the agreement will be automatically renewed for another year. This creates ambiguity as to whether an explicit written agreement is required for renewal or whether a lack of notice is sufficient.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of this section limits indemnification to situations where the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. The subsequent sentences broaden the scope of indemnification by specifying that 2TheMart will indemnify i-Escrow for claims arising from 2TheMart Content, and i-Escrow will indemnify 2TheMart for claims arising from i-Escrow Content and the Services. This creates ambiguity as to whether the 'principal' limitation applies to the content-related indemnification obligations, or whether those obligations are independent and not subject to that limitation.",

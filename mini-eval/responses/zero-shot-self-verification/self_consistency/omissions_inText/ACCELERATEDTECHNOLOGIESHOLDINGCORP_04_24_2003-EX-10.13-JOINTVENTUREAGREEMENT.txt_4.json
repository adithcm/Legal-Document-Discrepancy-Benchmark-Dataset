        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'as needed' is ambiguous and doesn't specify how the need is determined, who determines it, or what happens if a Joint Venturer disagrees with the assessment of need. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes regarding capital contributions.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement grants broad authority to either Joint Venturer to execute instruments. This could lead to a contradiction if one Joint Venturer makes decisions or enters into agreements that the other Joint Venturer does not agree with or that are not in the best interest of the Joint Venture. There is no mechanism for checks and balances or dispute resolution regarding such actions.",

Depreciation and all other charges and expenses, which are not expressly apportioned by this Agreement, shall be apportioned in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.",
        "explanation": "This section provides conflicting information about how costs will be shared between the joint venturers. The first part of the statement says that 50% goes to each company and the next part says the costs will be split by 'generally accepted accounting principles'. This creates an ambiguity, on how the costs will be split and is contradictory.  ",

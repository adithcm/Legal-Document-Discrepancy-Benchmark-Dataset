        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "The section states that Accuray has two weeks to either accept or reject a Purchase Order, but then states that a failure to respond constitutes a disapproval. This is an ambiguity in text.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains inconsistencies in text. It states Accuray will pay for expedited shipping if the delivery date is at least six months after submission, then gives an example where Accuray pays if the delivery date is December 1st, when the purchase order was June 1st, and the Distributor will pay if the delivery date is October 1st, when the purchase order was June 1st.",

Full payment of the purchase price for Products (other than Systems), Spare Parts and upgrades shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars by wire transfer to a bank selected by Accuray and is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice. These sections contradict each other. Section 5.4.1.2.2 states that the remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray, which contradicts section 5.4.2 which states full payment is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray.",

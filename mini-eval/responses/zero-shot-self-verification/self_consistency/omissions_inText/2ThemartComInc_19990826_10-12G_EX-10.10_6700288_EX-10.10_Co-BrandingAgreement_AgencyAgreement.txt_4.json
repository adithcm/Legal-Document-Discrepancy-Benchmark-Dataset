        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the term and renewal process of the agreement. It states that the agreement is automatically renewed if a renewal notice is not given, creating a contradiction. The main text says it can be renewed by mutual agreement, but then adds in a line saying it is automatically renewed if notice is not provided.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that indemnification is provided to the extent the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. The subsequent sentences then broaden the scope of indemnification to include claims arising from content, without any mention of the principal-agent relationship. This creates ambiguity as to the scope of the indemnity obligation.",

Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought in a court in Orange County, California.",
        "explanation": "This section states that any cause of action arising under this agreement shall be brought in a court in Orange County, California. This clause is overly restrictive, as it may conflict with federal law regarding jurisdiction and venue, especially if the parties or cause of action have connections outside of Orange County.",

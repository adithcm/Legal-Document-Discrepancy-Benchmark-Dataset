        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it does not specify how the need for capital contributions will be determined, who decides the amount, and what happens if a Joint Venturer fails to contribute when required. The lack of clarity could lead to disagreements and disputes.",

        "explanation": "While aiming to avoid partnership classification for tax purposes, the agreement's operational aspects might inadvertently create a partnership under common law principles. For example, the sharing of profits and losses (Section 6) and the joint control over the business (Section 5) are characteristics of a partnership. If the IRS or a court determines that the Joint Venture operates as a partnership despite the stated intention, the election under Section 761(a) might be disregarded, leading to unintended tax consequences.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section outlines a repayment schedule if the consultant doesn't meet a minimum number of tournament appearances. However, it lacks a clear definition of what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play.' This ambiguity makes the repayment clause difficult to enforce, as there's no objective standard to determine if the consultant's performance was truly unsatisfactory.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause introduces a contradiction. While it states that ADAMS GOLF can terminate the agreement if the consultant is 'unable to play tour golf at all', it also requires the consultant's estate to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period. This seems unreasonable, as the inability to perform is involuntary and beyond the consultant's control, especially in the case of death. Requiring repayment in such a scenario creates an unfair and potentially unenforceable burden.",

        "explanation": "The use of 'senior management becoming aware of the conduct' is ambiguous. It does not specify which individuals constitute 'senior management'. This lack of clarity can create disputes regarding when the 90-day period begins, leading to potential disagreements about the timeliness of the termination notice.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider. However, section 1.1(a) says \"Provider agrees to respond in good faith to any reasonable request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, at a price to be agreed upon after good faith negotiations between the Parties.\". It is unclear whether the Provider Representatives can provide these additional services, creating confusion.",

        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and does not make sense. It contains unnecessary repetition of the word 'Agreement' and is not grammatically correct.",

        "explanation": "This section allows for termination 'in whole or in part'. However, Section 3.3 states that a party may terminate 'in whole but not in part'. This is a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 is referenced as surviving termination. However, section 2.2 concerns Terms of Payment and Related Matters. The obligation to pay for services already rendered would normally survive termination regardless of this clause; the lack of clarity regarding *which* specific obligations under 2.2 are meant to survive creates ambiguity.",

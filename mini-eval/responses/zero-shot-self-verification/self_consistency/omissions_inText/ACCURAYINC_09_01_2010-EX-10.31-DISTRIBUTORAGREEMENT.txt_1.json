        "explanation": "This definition is incomplete and does not provide any useful information about what constitutes a 'Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase'. It simply states that it 'means a purchase', which is redundant and unhelpful. This lack of clarity creates ambiguity regarding the scope of the agreement and the types of transactions it covers.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the responsibility for expedited shipping costs based on the delivery deadline requested in the Purchase Order. It states that Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order, while the Distributor bears the cost if the deadline is shorter. This creates a contradiction with Section 2.4 which states that 'As of the Effective Time and to the best of Accuray's knowledge, Accuray's standard lead time for delivery of Products is six months.' If the standard lead time is six months, then a requested delivery date sooner than six months would always require expedited shipping, making Accuray's commitment to cover expedited costs for delivery dates at least six months out effectively meaningless.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents conflicting information regarding who bears the supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, Accuray bears the costs. However, it then provides an example where if the delivery date is October 1st and the Purchase Order was submitted on June 1st, the expedited delivery expenses will be borne by the Distributor. Since the date is only 4 months away in the second example, it goes against what was previously stated.",

        "section": "5.4.1.1. Letter of Credit. An irrevocable trade finance letter of credit issued by Distributor's bank, confirmed by a bank designated by Accuray in all respects and delivered to Accuray upon the acceptance of the Purchase Order by Accuray. The letter of credit will provide that Accuray can draw against the letter of credit according to the following schedule: 5.4.1.1.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 5.4.1.1.2. Balance upon presentation of documents by Accuray evidencing shipment of the Products to Distributor or Customer as designated in the Purchase Order.",
        "explanation": "In section 5.4.1.1, under Letter of Credit, it is stated that the $100,000 is non-refundable and if the Purchase Order is cancelled, the money will automatically be applied to the Distributor's next purchase of a System. However, it does not state within which time frame this 'next purchase' needs to take place. This creates ambiguity and is an omission in text.",

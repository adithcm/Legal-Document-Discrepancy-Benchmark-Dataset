        "section": "In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This clause contradicts the general principle that contract renewals require mutual agreement. It stipulates automatic renewal if a party fails to provide notice of non-renewal, essentially forcing an extension without explicit consent. This is an in-text contradiction because the agreement initially states renewal requires 'mutual written agreement'.",

        "explanation": "This clause contradicts the earlier statement in Section 6.5: 'All rights (under any applicable intellectual property right) granted herein are not sublicenseable, transferable or assignable.' This section makes all rights non-sublicenseable and the clause in question allows 2TheMart to sublicense. This is a direct contradiction.",

        "section": "Once every twelve (12) months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with i-Escrow's business activities and with no less than fifteen (15) days notice. i-Escrow shall within two (2) weeks make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit. Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of ten percent (10%) of the payments owed to date, i-Escrow shall immediately pay all cost of such audit.",
        "explanation": "The statement has structural flaws because it has grammatical errors that can impact how the statements are read. For example, the final sentence is not a properly formed sentence because the word all is missing before cost. The sentence states 'i-Escrow shall immediately pay cost of such audit.' instead of 'i-Escrow shall immediately pay all cost of such audit.' This makes the sentence improperly structured.",

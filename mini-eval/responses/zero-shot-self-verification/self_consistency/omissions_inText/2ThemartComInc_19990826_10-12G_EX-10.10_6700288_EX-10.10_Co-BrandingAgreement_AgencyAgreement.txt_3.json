        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a potential contradiction. It states that if the Launch Date doesn't occur within 4 months of the Effective Date, either party can terminate the agreement. However, it then states that if only ONE party has used good faith efforts, only THAT party can terminate. This creates ambiguity: if NEITHER party uses good faith efforts, can either party terminate? The wording suggests only the party using good faith efforts can terminate, implying the other party is locked in, which doesn't seem logical. It's unclear what happens if neither party fulfills their obligations.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The language regarding renewal is contradictory. It states the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement. However, it then states that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates ambiguity: does a written agreement need to be made, or is lack of notice sufficient for renewal? These two sentences contradict each other.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party\" introduces ambiguity. Indemnification usually arises from the actions of the Indemnifying Party, regardless of a principal-agent relationship. Linking the indemnity to a principal-agent relationship significantly limits the scope of indemnification and creates uncertainty. It's unclear under what circumstances the Indemnified Party would be \"deemed a principal\" of the Indemnifying Party in the context of this agreement. This could be interpreted in multiple ways, weakening the indemnity clause.",

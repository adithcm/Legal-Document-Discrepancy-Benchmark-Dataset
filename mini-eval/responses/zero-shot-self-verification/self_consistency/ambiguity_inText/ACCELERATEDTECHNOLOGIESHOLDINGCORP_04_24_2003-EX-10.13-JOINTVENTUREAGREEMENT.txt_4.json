        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, it doesn't specify what happens if the Joint Venture needs capital and the venturers don't agree. The omission of a default mechanism or alternative funding arrangement creates uncertainty.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture. The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture, even those instruments that could incur liability or indebtedness for borrowed funds, dispose of assets, or purchase any items for the Joint Venture. The need for written consent or approval is only required for strategic partnerships with other organizations.",
        "explanation": "While granting both Joint Venturers authority to execute instruments, including those incurring liability or disposing of assets, it only requires written consent for strategic partnerships. This implies unilateral action is permissible in significant financial decisions outside strategic partnerships, increasing the risk of financial mismanagement or disagreement that is not checked by the other venturer.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.",
        "explanation": "This section dictates how assets are distributed upon termination. While unexpended funds are distributed according to ownership percentages, all other assets are distributed at the discretion of a third-party mediator, irrespective of ownership percentages. This is a structural flaw as it is not appropriate to change asset allocation based on discretion.",

        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity because it is not clear what constitutes 'good faith and reasonable efforts'. It's subjective and could lead to disputes if one party claims the other didn't act in good faith. Furthermore, if neither party uses good faith and reasonable development efforts, it is unclear if either party can terminate the agreement, even after 4 months.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The calculation of advertising fees is based on 'the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter'. However, 'Customers' is defined in Section 1(c) as users who complete at least one transaction *per month*. This creates a contradiction. Should the average transaction amount be based on all transactions in a quarter, or only those transactions made by users who complete at least one transaction per month? The ambiguity in using the term 'Customers' in defining 'Transaction Inquiries' leads to contradicting calculations, and therefore, potential issues.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The section contains a structural flaw. The sentence 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.' is repeated. This is a structural flaw as it is unncessary.",

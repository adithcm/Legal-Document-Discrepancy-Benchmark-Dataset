        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This creates an ambiguity. While the Provider agrees to provide services outlined in Exhibit A, they are not obligated to provide 'additional services and resources' even if 'necessary for the operation of the Recipient' unless the Provider deems it fit and feasible. This contradicts the overall purpose of the service agreement, as it allows the provider to potentially withhold essential services. The lack of a clear definition of 'additional services and resources' leads to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, \"Losses\"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient' is ambiguous. It suggests that the Provider must indemnify the Recipient for claims made by the Recipient itself, which is unusual in indemnity clauses. Indemnification typically covers claims from third parties, not the indemnified party against the indemnifying party.",

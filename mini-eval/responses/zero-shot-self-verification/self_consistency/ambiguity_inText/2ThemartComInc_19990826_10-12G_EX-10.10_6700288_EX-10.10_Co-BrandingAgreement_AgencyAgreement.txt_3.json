        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual consent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The section outlines how advertising fees are calculated based on Transaction Inquiries. It states that the fee is 0.025% multiplied by the amount of the average Transaction. This is a very small percentage, but it is unclear if this is a monthly, quarterly or yearly payment. This lack of clarity creates a potential dispute over the actual payment amount and frequency.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that neither party expresses a desire to renew the agreement in writing, the term of this Agreement shall expire automatically.",
        "explanation": "The repetition of 'A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect' is redundant and suggests a possible error in drafting. This redundancy introduces a structural flaw, making the section awkward and potentially confusing, although the core meaning remains understandable.",

        "explanation": "The notice section provides different methods for delivering notices (personal delivery, fax, overnight courier). However, for overnight courier, it states notice is deemed given 'only three (3) days after the date of mailing'. This contradicts the nature of overnight courier services, which are designed for next-day delivery. This creates an inconsistency in the notification timeline.",

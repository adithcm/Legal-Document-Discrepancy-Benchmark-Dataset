        "explanation": "This clause creates an exception to the exclusivity clauses (4A, 4B, 4C) but is written as a negative constraint (shall not be required), rather than a permission. This is not a well written structure. It is not written properly and is hard to understand.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory. It initially states that CONSULTANT will indemnify ADAMS GOLF for all expenses, explicitly excluding attorney's fees. However, the very next sentence states that ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000. This creates an in-text contradiction, as it's unclear to what extent attorney's fees are covered under this agreement.",

        "section": "Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section refers to 'repayment amount calculated under paragraph 8A'. Paragraph 8A outlines a repayment schedule based on the number of tournaments not played. Applying this same calculation in cases of termination due to consultant's death or inability to play (Section 22), or termination for cause by either party (Section 23) could result in an inequitable penalty. Paragraph 8A addresses a specific scenario (failure to play a minimum number of tournaments) and using that formula for other types of termination does not make sense, especially in the event of death.",

        "explanation": "Section 3.6 requires the Distributor to send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. However, Section 4.1.2 states that if a Purchase Order is submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray. This contradicts Section 3.6 because the six-month lead time is not being followed.",

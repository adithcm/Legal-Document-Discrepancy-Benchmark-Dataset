        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency because it mentions that the minimum number of tournaments includes 'both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games,' but then refers to achieving a satisfactory record of play in less than the specified number of 'SPGA and/or PGA tour events.' The inclusion of the Skins Games should be clarified as to whether not participating in Skins Game counts toward the total amount of tournaments.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section requires repayment from the consultant or their estate if they die or are unable to play. This creates a contradiction. Requiring repayment in the event of death seems unreasonable and potentially unenforceable, as the inability to perform is not due to a breach of contract but an unforeseen circumstance. It is not structured properly and does not make sense.",

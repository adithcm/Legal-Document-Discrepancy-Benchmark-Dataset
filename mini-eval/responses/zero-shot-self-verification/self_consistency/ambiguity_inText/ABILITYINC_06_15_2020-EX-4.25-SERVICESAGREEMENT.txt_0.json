        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity in the provider's obligations. While the provider agrees to provide services in Exhibit A, it simultaneously reserves the right to deny requests for additional services, even if necessary for the recipient's operation, based on the provider's discretion. This undermines the initial agreement to provide services and leads to uncertainty regarding the scope of the provider's responsibilities.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the terms of payment including, 'Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee.' and 'Provider shall allow the Recipient to use [ * * * ] at no cost, until December 31, 2021.' If the contract is terminated on December 31, 2020, how can the provider allow the Recipient to use something until December 31, 2021?",

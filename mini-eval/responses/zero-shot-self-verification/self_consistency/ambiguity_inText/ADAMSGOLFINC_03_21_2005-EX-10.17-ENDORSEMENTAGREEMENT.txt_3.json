        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "This section details a repayment schedule if the consultant doesn't meet a minimum number of tournaments. However, the exact minimum number of tournaments required for a satisfactory record of play is redacted ([*****]), making the repayment clause ambiguous and difficult to enforce. It's impossible to determine the repayment amount without knowing the threshold of tournaments required.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines termination for cause and specifies that upon termination, the CONSULTANT must repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period, calculated according to paragraph 8A. However, Paragraph 8A discusses repayment by the CONSULTANT if he does not achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum number of professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour. There is no logical correlation between not performing the contract due to breach, and the consultant not being able to reach the minimum amount of games. Using paragraph 8A does not make logical sense in this context.",

        "explanation": "This section states that Adams Golf will indemnify and hold Consultant harmless from any expenses arising out of advertising material. However, Section 14 states that CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (excluding attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement. There is a misalignment of indemnity and it is unclear what is indemnifying what.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous because it requires users to complete at least one transaction *per month*. This introduces a contradiction because the agreement's term extends for one year, implying that a user must complete a transaction every month to be considered a 'Customer'. This is not practical and contradicts the general intent of defining a customer.",

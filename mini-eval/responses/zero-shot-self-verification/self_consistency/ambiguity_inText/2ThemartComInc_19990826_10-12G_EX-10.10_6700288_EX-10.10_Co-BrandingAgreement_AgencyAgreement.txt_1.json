        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' requires them to complete at least one transaction *per month*. This is an unusual and restrictive definition, as it implies someone ceases to be a customer if they don't transact every month. This is an Ambiguity in text, because it does not explain what will happen if a customer does not access the Co-Branded site for one month.",

The document date indicates 8/26/1999. If the parties were unable to agree to the SOW by August 21, 1999, then how does it make sense for the agreement to be documented 5 days later?",

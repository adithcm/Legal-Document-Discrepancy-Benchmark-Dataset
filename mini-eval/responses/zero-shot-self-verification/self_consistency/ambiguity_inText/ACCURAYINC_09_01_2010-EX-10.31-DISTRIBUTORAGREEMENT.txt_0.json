        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines responsibility for expedited shipping costs based on the delivery deadline requested in the Purchase Order. It states that Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the examples provided use 'June 1' and 'December 1' (six months) and 'October 1' (four months) as the requested delivery dates. This creates an in-text contradiction. The text initially says 'at least six months' but implies less than six months in the second example by saying 'while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor', making the delivery timeline in question ambigious.",

Any such reports shall be provided to Accuray via electronic mail to the following address: complaints@accuray.com.",
        "explanation": "This section is a contradiction in legal terms due to an omission. While it stipulates the Distributor's duty to report customer complaints to Accuray via email, it omits specifying a timeframe within which these reports must be made. This omission creates a loophole, potentially undermining the purpose of the reporting requirement, as delays in reporting could hinder Accuray's ability to address issues promptly and maintain product/service quality under applicable laws.",

        "explanation": "This section describes a scenario where the Distributor receives credit for sales even if Accuray contracts directly with a potential customer after initially not approving a Quote. However, it refers to conditions in 'Section 3.4 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement' without clearly defining what those conditions are within this current agreement, Exhibit 10.31, creating ambiguity. This reference requires the reader to consult another document to fully understand the obligations and entitlements of the Distributor, creating an in-text contradiction.",

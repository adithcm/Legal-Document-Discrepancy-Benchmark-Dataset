        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Paragraph 23 states that upon termination for cause due to CONSULTANT'S breach, CONSULTANT is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period, calculated as in paragraph 8A. However, paragraph 19(C) states, \"In the event of ADAMS GOLF'S insolvency or bankruptcy, it is expressly agreed to by the parties that CONSULTANT shall not be obligated to repay any money so long as CONSULTANT continues to fully perform his obligations under this Agreement.\" This introduces a contradiction: if Adams Golf terminates the agreement due to insolvency/bankruptcy (presumably for cause related to financial instability), and CONSULTANT has continued to perform all obligations, paragraph 19(C) seemingly prevents repayment, while paragraph 23 dictates it.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that the consultant agrees to protect and hold harmless the golf company from any suits, damages, and expenses but excludes attorney fees. Then in the second sentence it states that the golf company will cover the consultant's attorney fees up to $10,000. The first part of the paragraph states that the consultant will have to cover the fees, and then it switches and says that the golf company will cover them.",

ADAMS GOLF shall pay all charges in connection with the delivery of MANDATORY PRODUCTS to CONSULTANT. B.In addition to paragraph 17A above, ADAMS GOLF shall provide CONSULTANT with [*****] sets of clubs for CONSULTANT'S family and friends each calendar year of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph includes that Adams Golf will supply a set number of golf clubs to the consultant's family and friends. This could potentially be considered a form of bribery, depending on the amount of clubs being supplied. Bribery is illegal, so the contract is setting up a requirement that violates federal or state law.",

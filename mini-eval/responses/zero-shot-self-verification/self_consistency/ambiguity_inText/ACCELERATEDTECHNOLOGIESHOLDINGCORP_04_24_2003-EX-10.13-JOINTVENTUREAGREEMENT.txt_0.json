        "explanation": "This section provides no guidance or requirement for any capital contributions to be made. This makes it hard to enforce the contract as there are no financial obligations for the parties to fulfill.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture, even those instruments that could incur liability or indebtedness for borrowed funds, dispose of assets, or purchase any items for the Joint Venture. The need for written consent or approval is only required for strategic partnerships with other organizations.",
        "explanation": "This section grants each Joint Venturer unilateral authority to execute instruments, including those incurring significant liability, without requiring the other's consent. This contradicts the fundamental principle of a joint venture, which typically involves shared control and decision-making. The exception for 'strategic partnerships' does not adequately address the broad authority granted, potentially leading to disputes and financial risk.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.",
        "explanation": "This section has contradictory terms regarding distribution of assets upon termination. It states that unexpended funds are to be distributed based on ownership percentage, but other assets are to be distributed at the sole discretion of a third-party mediator, irrespective of ownership interest. This is a contradiction, as it is unclear how the distribution of assets is meant to be handled.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency regarding who bears the supplementary shipping costs for expedited delivery. The section states that Accuray bears the costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, but the distributor bears the costs if it is not. The section is ambigious because it also states that Accuray will ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground. If a Purchase Order requests a delivery date that is less than six months, the accelerated shipping costs would be borne by the distributor. However, if Accuray is using the shipping method contained in the Purchase Order, the language could imply that Accuray is responsible for all shipping costs, regardless of delivery date.",

For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section requires the Distributor to send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. However, section 4.1.2 states that 'if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.' Because section 4.1.2 references deliveries with less than a six month lead time, this directly contradicts section 3.6.",

        "explanation": "The obligation to provide spare parts for 10 years after the last shipment of a System 'pursuant to this agreement' is vague. It is unclear whether this obligation extends only to customers acquired during the term of this agreement, or if it applies to all customers, including those acquired after the agreement's termination through other distribution channels.",

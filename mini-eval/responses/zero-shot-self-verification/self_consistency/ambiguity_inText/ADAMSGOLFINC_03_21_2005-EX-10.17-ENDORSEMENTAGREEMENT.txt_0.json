        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "The section outlines a repayment scheme if the consultant doesn't meet the minimum number of tournaments. However, the number of minimum tournaments is redacted ([*****]) which causes an ambiguity. The amount to be repaid per event is also redacted making it impossible to calculate repayment properly. This constitutes an in-text contradiction because the agreement stipulates a penalty for not playing enough tournaments but the terms of this repayment cannot be determined.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section allows ADAMS GOLF to terminate the agreement if CONSULTANT dies or can no longer play, and demands repayment for the unperformed period of the agreement. Paragraph 8A, however, details a specific repayment schedule related to the *number of tournaments played* not to death or inability to play. Applying tournament based repayment to a situation where no tournaments are played due to death is illogical and contradictory. The text does not specify how the 'repayment amount' is to be calculated in this situation, only referencing tournament paybacks.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall use best efforts to be available for such press interviews, radio or TV appearances arranged for CONSULTANT by ADAMS GOLF which are compatible with CONSULTANT'S own practice, play and personal time requirements. CONSULTANT will be required to be available after a tournament for selected interviews, either the Sunday afternoon or Monday morning following the tournament. In all such interviews and appearances, CONSULTANT will use his best efforts to make reference to the ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT and wear [*****] and display ADAMS GOLF'S brand name.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that the consultant will use best efforts to be available for such press interviews while the second sentence states that the CONSULTANT will be required to be available after a tournament for selected interviews. Using 'best efforts' and then stating that it is 'required' are contradictory. Best effort suggests flexibility while required implies a mandatory obligation, making it difficult to determine the consultant's actual responsibility regarding post-tournament interviews.",

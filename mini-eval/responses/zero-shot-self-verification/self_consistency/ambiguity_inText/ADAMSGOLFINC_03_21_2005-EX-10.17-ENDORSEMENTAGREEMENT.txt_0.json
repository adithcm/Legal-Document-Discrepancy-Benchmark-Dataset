        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall not be required to wear ADAMS GOLF [*****] in [*****] ads.",
        "explanation": "This section contradicts the general exclusivity outlined in paragraphs 4A, 4B, and 4C. While those paragraphs restrict Watson from endorsing competing products, this section provides an exception, allowing him to not wear Adams Golf apparel in certain ads. This creates a contradiction by undermining the exclusivity clause. It's not clear in which instances Watson may not be required to wear ADAMS GOLF apparel, leading to different interpretations.",

        "section": "If CONSULTANT disapproves, the reasons therefore shall be given to ADAMS GOLF in writing within three (3) business days or shall be deemed approved.",
        "explanation": "This sentence lacks clarity regarding the approval process for advertising material. The phrase 'shall be deemed approved' is open to interpretation. It is unclear if ADAMS GOLF has to wait until the three business days has passed to begin advertising or promotional activity or whether ADAMS GOLF can consider it approved right away.",

        "section": "Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This statement presents an inconsistency. This section stipulates that if there is any termination of the agreement, that the Consultant shall repay Adams Golf. However, paragraph 19.C states that 'In the event of ADAMS GOLF'S insolvency or bankruptcy, it is expressly agreed to by the parties that CONSULTANT shall not be obligated to repay any money so long as CONSULTANT continues to fully perform his obligations under this Agreement.' This creates a contradiction because if the company goes bankrupt, the consultant will not need to pay, but in most other termination cases, the consultant will need to pay.",

        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the Provider's obligations. While the first sentence suggests a clear obligation to provide services outlined in Exhibit A, the subsequent sentence introduces a discretionary element. The Provider is not obligated to provide 'additional' services, which creates confusion and leads to multiple interpretations. It is unclear what constitutes an 'additional' service versus a service already implied or necessary to fulfill the agreement",

        "explanation": "There is ambiguity in the text because the phrase 'Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' is structurally flawed and does not make sense. This creates confusion as to when the document is supposed to go into effect.",

        "explanation": "This section includes a condition for the Recipient's ownership of intellectual property, requiring both parties to agree that the creation is related to the services. The phrase 'if both parties agree it is related to the services' creates an ambiguity that makes the Recipient's ownership conditional and dependent on the Provider's agreement, which could lead to disputes and uncertainty about IP ownership.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency regarding who bears the expedited delivery costs. It states that Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the purchase order submission. However, the subsequent example contradicts this by stating that if the delivery date is October 1 and the purchase order was submitted on June 1 (which is four months, less than 6 months), the expedited delivery expenses are borne by the Distributor. This contradicts the previous statement that stated that the delivery date must be at least 6 months out.",

        "section": "5.4.1. System Purchase Payments. Payment for the purchase of a System shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars in the form of either (1) an irrevocable trade finance letter of credit or (2) wire transfer as further described in Sections 5.4.1.1 (Letter of Credit) and 5.4.1.2 (Wire Transfer), respectively below. Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a 'business person' (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, 'BGB'), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an ambiguity in text that could lead to disputes over payment terms. While it states that Accuray bears the cost of bank charges for a letter of credit and commission charges for a wire transfer, it is unclear whether this applies to both payment methods or only the specific method mentioned in the same sentence. The language creates uncertainty as to whether the distributor is responsible for wire transfer fees if a letter of credit is used. If a dispute arises, a court could interpret the language to favor the party that did not draft the contract.",

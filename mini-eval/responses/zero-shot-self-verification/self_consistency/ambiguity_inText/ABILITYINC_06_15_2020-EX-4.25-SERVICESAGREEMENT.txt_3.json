(a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity regarding the Provider's obligations. While the Provider agrees to provide services listed in Exhibit A, it reserves the right to refuse additional services even if they are necessary for the Recipient's operation. This creates a contradiction as to what the Recipient can expect from the Provider during the agreement.",

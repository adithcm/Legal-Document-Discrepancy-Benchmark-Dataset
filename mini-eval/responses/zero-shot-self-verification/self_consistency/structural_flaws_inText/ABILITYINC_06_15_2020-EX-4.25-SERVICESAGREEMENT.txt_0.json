        "section": "For such time as any employees of Provider are providing the Services to Recipient under this Agreement, (a) such employees will remain employees of Provider unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, and may under certain circumstances, be deemed employees of Recipient for specific purposes as determined by Recipient, and (b) while Provider generally remains responsible for the payment of wages, Recipient may, at its discretion, contribute to or assume responsibility for certain wages, bonuses, commissions, or employee benefits, with terms to be negotiated separately for each individual case. The responsibility for withholding and payment of applicable taxes will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the employment status of the Provider's employees. It states they remain employees of the Provider, but also indicates they 'may... be deemed employees of Recipient for specific purposes as determined by Recipient.' This creates uncertainty about who is ultimately responsible for the employees and their actions, leading to potential legal disputes.",

However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "The language presents a contradiction. It states that either party can terminate 'at any time without cause,' but then mandates a 90-day notice period and mentions a termination fee and potential liabilities based on outstanding commitments. This contradicts the 'at any time without cause' clause, as it imposes conditions and financial implications on termination.",

(d) Notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.",
        "explanation": "The conditions outlined for when notices are 'deemed given' are structurally flawed and can lead to disputes. Especially (c) and (d). (c) requiring a recipient to confirm receipt within 72 hours is not always feasible or verifiable. (d) deeming notices sent via mail as received upon dispatch disregards the possibility of lost or delayed mail.",

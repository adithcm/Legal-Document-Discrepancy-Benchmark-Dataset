The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****].

The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section provides an exception to the exclusivity clause (Section 4 A, B, and C), allowing the CONSULTANT to endorse [*****]. However, the exact scope and limitations of this exception are unclear due to the redactions. It's uncertain what the CONSULTANT is permitted to do with [*****], and under what specific conditions. It is difficult to understand what is allowed and not allowed. Because of this, it creates ambiguity.",

If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1.

        "explanation": "Section 22 states that if CONSULTANT is unable to play tour golf at all, the contract may be terminated. It is ambigious, becuase it does not define what unable to play golf at all means. Does this mean forever, or does this mean for a period of time.

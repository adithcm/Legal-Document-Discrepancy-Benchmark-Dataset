        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon. However, the agreement lacks a clear process or mechanism for how such mutual consent would be documented or enforced. The absence of a defined procedure creates ambiguity about how future agreements on capital contributions would be handled, potentially leading to disputes.",

        "explanation": "This section mentions 'Partnership,' 'Syndicate,' and 'Owner,' but the agreement otherwise refers to the parties as 'Joint Venturers' or 'Parties.'

        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement creates ambiguity because it doesn't define what constitutes 'mutual consent.' It doesn't specify how this consent must be documented (e.g., in writing) or what happens if the parties disagree on the necessity or amount of a capital contribution. This could lead to disputes later on.",

        "explanation": "This section uses multiple terms\u2014'Goods,' 'Partnership,' and 'Syndicate'\u2014 without clearly defining them within the context of this Joint Venture Agreement. The Joint Venture is referred to as the Joint Venture throughout the contract. This misalignment of terminology creates confusion regarding the scope of expenses covered by the Joint Venture.",

        "explanation": "The clause is missing the end date of when the written agreement must be made to extend the contract. If a written agreement is made 29 days before the scheduled termination then is that contract automatically terminated?",

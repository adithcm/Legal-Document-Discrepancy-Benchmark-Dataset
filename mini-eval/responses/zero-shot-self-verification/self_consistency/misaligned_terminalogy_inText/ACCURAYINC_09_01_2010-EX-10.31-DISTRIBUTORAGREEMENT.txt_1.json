        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section says that Accuray has two weeks to respond to a purchase order or it is considered disapproved. However, it then says that a purchase order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This is contradictory because it's unclear if a purchase order is accepted upon the two week mark of no response, or when it is signed and executed by Accuray. This is an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an in-text contradiction because it states that Accuray will pay expedited shipping costs if the delivery date is at least six months after the purchase order submission. However, the following example provides two different delivery dates, one that is six months after the submission, and one that is not, implying that Accuray would not pay the expedited costs for the delivery date that is not six months out. It is not clear what happens if the delivery date is exactly six months out, because of the wording \"at least six months\".",

        "section": "5.5. Collections. Notwithstanding Section 5.4.3 above, Distributor shall be solely responsible for determining the creditworthiness of and collecting payment from its Customers. The risk of non-collection from the Customer will be borne entirely by Distributor, which shall be responsible for making timely payment to Accuray for Products whether or not Distributor is successful in collecting from its Customer. In the event that full payment is not received by Accuray, Accuray shall not be liable to Distributor for any margin or commission unless and until it has received payment of amounts sufficient to cover the costs incurred by Accuray to provide the applicable Products to Distributor and the applicable Services to Customer (\"Accuray Cost\"). Distributor acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled to receive payment of any margin or commission until Accuray has received payment of the Accuray Cost amount in relation to the applicable Products and Services.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an in-text contradiction. The first part clearly states that the Distributor is responsible for paying Accuray, regardless of whether the Distributor collects payment from its customers. However, the following sentences state that Accuray is not liable to the Distributor for any margin or commission until Accuray has received full payment. This implies that the Distributor's payment to Accuray is, in fact, dependent on the Distributor collecting payment from customers, which directly contradicts the initial statement.",

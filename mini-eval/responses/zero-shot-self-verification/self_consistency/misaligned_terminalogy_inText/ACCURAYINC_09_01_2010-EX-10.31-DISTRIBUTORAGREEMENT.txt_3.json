        "section": "If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity regarding when payment is considered past due. It states that if the Distributor is a 'business person' under German law, payment is only past due after a payment demand note is received, contradicting the earlier statement that past due balances bear interest at a fixed rate per month. This creates confusion as to which condition determines when interest applies.",

        "explanation": "There is ambiguity in legal terms because it first states Accuray is responsible for expenses to obtain permits and licenses, but then states that Accuray may require the distributor to be responsible for those expenses. This statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section contains an in-text contradiction. It initially states that the CONSULTANT shall exclusively use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, but then it explains that CONSULTANT may play other clubs other than ADAMS GOLF clubs, but may not endorse those clubs. Since it states in the first part of the sentence that the use is exclusive, there is a contradiction when it follows up with saying that he may play other clubs.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "The text lacks clarity due to the redactions. It mentions a minimum number of events CONSULTANT must play but the exact number is redacted. It then says if the CONSULTANT plays less than the redacted number of events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF. It's impossible to determine the precise obligations and potential repayment amounts, making the clause ambiguous.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the termination of the agreement if the CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all. It requires that the CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT's estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. Since this is a section for termination, it contradicts the spirit of a termination as the death or inablity to play would impose hardship to the CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT's estate. This is a contradiction as it imposes a financial burden during a very difficult time.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding renewal. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then adds that if no notice is given, the agreement automatically renews for another year. This creates uncertainty as to the actual requirements for renewal.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The initial indemnity clause states that the Protected Party must be considered a 'key agent' of the Guarantor for the indemnity to apply. However, the subsequent sentences regarding 2TheMart indemnifying i-Escrow and i-Escrow indemnifying 2TheMart do not include this 'key agent' requirement. This creates an inconsistency as to whether the 'key agent' limitation applies to all indemnification obligations or only the general one stated in the first sentence. It is ambiguous.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The statement that 'This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties' is ambiguous regarding the method for 'market analysis'. It does not define what type of market analysis is needed or who performs it. This can lead to disputes about whether an updated price based on market analysis is acceptable.",

        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement implies that capital contributions are optional unless both parties agree otherwise. This could lead to ambiguity and disputes if one party assumes the other will contribute capital, and no explicit agreement is made.",
        "location": "Section 3",
        "category": 1,

        "section": "All direct costs and expenses, which shall include any insurance costs in connection with the distribution of the Goods or operations of the Partnership, or if the business of the Syndicate requires additional office facilities than those now presently maintained by each Owner, such item shall be paid by the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This section contains several structural flaws in its writing. The terms 'Goods,' 'Partnership,' 'Syndicate,' and 'Owner' are used without prior definition within the context of the Joint Venture Agreement, leading to confusion about their specific relevance and applicability.",

        "explanation": "The term of the joint venture is explicitly defined with a start and end date, but the condition for extension lacks clarity. It states that the agreement can be extended 'unless extended by written agreement', this phrase is structurally flawed. A clearer construction would be 'unless extended by a written agreement'.",

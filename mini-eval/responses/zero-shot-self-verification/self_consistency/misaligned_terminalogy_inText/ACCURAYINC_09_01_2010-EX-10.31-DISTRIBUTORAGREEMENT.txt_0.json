        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence says that Accuray has two weeks to accept or reject the purchase order, but if they fail to do so, it means that it is automatically disapproved, so in essence, Accuray can reject the purchase order in two weeks. The next sentence states that Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This is implying that Accuray does not have two weeks to reject or accept the purchase order, but rather it can be accepted right away, creating an ambiguity.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The last two sentences contradict each other with the delivery dates. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor. This implies that the Acuuray is responsible for December 1st, but the distributor is for October 1st.",

        "explanation": "The agreement states 'This Agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto'. Then it states 'In case of any contradiction between this Agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.' This does not make sense as if there is a contradiction, the agreements do not have the exact same terms, which means it is not the entire agreement of the parties.",

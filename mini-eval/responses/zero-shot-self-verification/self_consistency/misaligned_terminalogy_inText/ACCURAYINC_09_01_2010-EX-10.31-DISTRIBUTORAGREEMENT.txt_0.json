        "section": "5.4.1.1. Letter of Credit. An irrevocable trade finance letter of credit issued by Distributor's bank, confirmed by a bank designated by Accuray in all respects and delivered to Accuray upon the acceptance of the Purchase Order by Accuray. The letter of credit will provide that Accuray can draw against the letter of credit according to the following schedule: 5.4.1.1.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 5.4.1.1.2. Balance upon presentation of documents by Accuray evidencing shipment of the Products to Distributor or Customer as designated in the Purchase Order.",
        "explanation": "Section 5.4.1.1.1 states that the initial payment must be made at least four months prior to the proposed shipment date. This contradicts the general understanding that payment terms are usually linked to delivery or performance milestones, not merely the proposal of a shipment date. This timeline is not standard.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in who bears the supplementary shipping costs. If the requested delivery date is at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order, Accuray bears the cost. However, the last sentence of this section mentions that if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor. The whole purpose of the 6 month buffer is not upheld.",

For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "Section 3.6 requires the Distributor to send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. This requirement is time-sensitive and directly impacts Accuray's ability to fulfill the order, which needs to align with Accuray's standard lead time for delivery of Products, which is six months. This creates a discrepancy when it comes to lead time.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. First, it states the consultant shall exclusively use the mandatory product. Then it allows the consultant to use other clubs as long as they do not endorse them. This is an in-text contradiction because if the consultant is using other clubs that are not Adams Golf, then they are not exclusively using Adams Golf products.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. It states that if the consultant dies, the estate shall repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the agreement not performed by the consultant. This is a contradiction because the consultant is dead and cannot perform. It is also a contradiction to charge the estate for something that is impossible to fulfill.",

        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity because of the phrase 'at every opportunity'. It is vague and ambiguous as to what constitutes 'every opportunity'. This can lead to disputes over whether the consultant is fulfilling the obligations of the agreement.",

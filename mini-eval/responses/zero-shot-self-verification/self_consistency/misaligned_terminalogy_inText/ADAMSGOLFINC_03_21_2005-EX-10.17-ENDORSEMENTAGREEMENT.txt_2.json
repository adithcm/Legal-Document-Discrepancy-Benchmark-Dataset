        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section allows the consultant to endorse and play another brand, [*****], despite the exclusivity clause in sections 4A, 4B, and 4C. While it attempts to define the boundaries of this exception (consistent with past practices, no logos on Adams Golf products), the vagueness and redactions create ambiguity. The lack of specifics regarding what constitutes acceptable 'past practice' and similarly situated professionals makes the exception difficult to enforce and open to interpretation. This conflicts with the intention of the exclusivity clause.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if the consultant is unable to play golf, even due to death, the consultant or their estate is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the period of the agreement not performed. This creates a contradiction as it seems unfair and potentially unconscionable to demand repayment in the event of death or permanent disability. This is especially problematic because death or permanent disability would clearly prevent the consultant from fulfilling the contract, making the repayment clause feel punitive rather than compensatory. Such a clause could be challenged in court as being against public policy.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.\nC.In the event that CONSULTANT is prevented from competing for reasons outside his control, the parties agree to a good faith attempt to resolve the issues. If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "While this section outlines the requirement for a minimum number of tournaments and a repayment schedule if that minimum isn't met, subsection C introduces a level of ambiguity. It states that if the consultant is prevented from competing for reasons outside their control, the parties will attempt to resolve the issues. However, it doesn't define what 'reasons outside his control' means. This creates uncertainty and could lead to disputes if, for example, the consultant is injured but ADAMS GOLF doesn't agree that the injury is a valid reason to waive the repayment. Also section C contradicts section A, since section A states that if he is in less events, he has to pay, but section C states that if he is unable to compete it will be resolved in good faith. ",

        "explanation": "This clause provides an exception to the exclusivity agreement outlined in paragraphs 4A, 4B, and 4C, but it is unclear what [*****] refers to. The document defines 'PRODUCT' broadly and the redacted term creates ambiguity as to what items CONSULTANT is exempt from wearing in [*****] ads. This omission leads to uncertainty and potential disputes regarding compliance with the exclusivity terms.",

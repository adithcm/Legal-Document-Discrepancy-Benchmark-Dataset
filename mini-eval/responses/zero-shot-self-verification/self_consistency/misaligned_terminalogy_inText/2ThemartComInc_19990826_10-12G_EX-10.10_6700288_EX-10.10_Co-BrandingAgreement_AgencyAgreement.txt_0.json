        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction regarding the renewal of the agreement. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then it adds that if a party does not give notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates ambiguity because it gives two different ways that the contract can be renewed, and it is not clear when each of those ways is supposed to happen.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow",
        "explanation": "The initial sentence of the indemnity clause includes a condition that the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. This condition significantly narrows the scope of the indemnity, but the subsequent sentences do not include this condition, creating ambiguity. It is not clear if the key agent condition applies to the entire indemnity clause or just the first sentence.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "There is an omission in the text because the Revised Pricing should be attached as an exhibit to the contract. Since it is not, then this becomes an in-text contradiction.",

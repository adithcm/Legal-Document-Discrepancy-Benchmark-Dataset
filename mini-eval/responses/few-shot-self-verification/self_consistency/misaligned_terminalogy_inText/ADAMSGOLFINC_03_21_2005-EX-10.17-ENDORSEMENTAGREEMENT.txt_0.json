        "explanation": "The contract states that the term begins September 1, 2004, but the agreement is dated January 13, 2005. This means the contract is being signed several months into the contract period. It is unclear if the consultant was working for the company prior to the contract being signed, or if the period between September 1, 2004 and January 13, 2005 will be included in the term.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction between Section 22 and Section 19 C. Section 22 requires repayment if the consultant dies. This contradicts Section 19(C), which stipulates that the consultant shall not be obligated to repay any money in the event of Adams Golf\u2019s insolvency or bankruptcy so long as the consultant continues to fully perform his obligations. Death makes it impossible for the consultant to 'continue to fully perform,' potentially triggering repayment under Section 22 despite the spirit of Section 19(C).",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'material breach' is not clearly defined, which leads to interpretation issues. This is a legal contradiction because without a clear definition or examples of what constitutes a material breach, it becomes challenging to determine when this termination clause can be validly invoked under the applicable Kansas law.",

        "section": "Accuray hereby appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of Products and Services to Customers solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, not to the exclusion of Accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The term 'solely in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases' restricts the distributor's ability to sell products or services independently, which contrasts with the non-exclusive nature of the appointment. This creates a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The text does not explain what happens if no agreement is made regarding the installation of products, therefore it is unclear who is responsible if another agreement isn't made, leading to a gap in responsibilities.",

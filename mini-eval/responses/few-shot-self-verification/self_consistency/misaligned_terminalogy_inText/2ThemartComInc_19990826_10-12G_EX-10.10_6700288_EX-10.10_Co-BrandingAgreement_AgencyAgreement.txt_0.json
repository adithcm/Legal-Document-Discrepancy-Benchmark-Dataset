        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that provisions survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete pending Customer transactions. The next sentence lists specific sections that survive expiration or termination of this Agreement, some of which may not be necessary for completing pending transactions, thus creating ambiguity and potential contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor' introduces ambiguity. It is unclear what criteria determine a 'key agent,' which could lead to disputes over the scope of indemnification. The scope is also overly broad.",

In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "There is a conflict in terms of renewal. The agreement states it may be renewed via 'mutual written agreement' but is followed by a clause of 'automatic renewal' if no notice is given. Either the contract needs to be resigned to renew or it happens automatically, the agreement contradicts itself.",

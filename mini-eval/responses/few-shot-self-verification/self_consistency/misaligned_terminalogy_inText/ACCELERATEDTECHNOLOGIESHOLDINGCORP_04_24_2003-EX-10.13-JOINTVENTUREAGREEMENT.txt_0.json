('PVSS'), (the 'Parties' or 'Joint Venturers' if referred to collectively, or the 'Entity' if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture",
        "explanation": "The contract states that the parties are 'business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture.' This is a contradiction because a joint venture is a type of partnership. This language could create confusion about the legal nature of the relationship and their respective liabilities.",

The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Participant shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Investor shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture shall be made.",
        "explanation": "The text grants each Joint Venturer authority to execute instruments but then restricts this authority by requiring both Joint Venturers' approval for key actions like incurring debt or disposing of assets. This creates an in-text contradiction in the scope of authority.",

        "explanation": "While the percentage split is clearly defined, this section lacks clarity on how losses are handled if one party cannot cover their share. This omission could lead to disputes over liability and financial obligations, especially given the statement in Section 3 that no capital contribution is required except by mutual consent.",

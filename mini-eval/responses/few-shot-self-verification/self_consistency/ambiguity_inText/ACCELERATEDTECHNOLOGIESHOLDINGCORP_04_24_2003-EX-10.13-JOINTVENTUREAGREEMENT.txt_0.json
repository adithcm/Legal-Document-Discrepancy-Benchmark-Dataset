        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture, even those instruments that could incur liability or indebtedness for borrowed funds, dispose of assets, or purchase any items for the Joint Venture. The need for written consent or approval is only required for strategic partnerships with other organizations.",
        "explanation": "This creates ambiguity, as it grants broad authority to either Joint Venturer to execute instruments, potentially including incurring debt or disposing of assets, without the consent of the other, except for strategic partnerships. This raises questions about the level of oversight and control each venturer has over the other's actions and the overall financial stability of the Joint Venture. It could lead to one venturer taking actions detrimental to the other without their prior knowledge or agreement.",

        "section": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests.",
        "explanation": "The section provides contradicting guidelines on how assets should be distributed on termination. It says unexpended funds should be distributed pro rata, yet all other assets are distributed at the sole discretion of a mediator, ignoring the prorata interests defined in Section 6. This gives undue authority to the mediator and can lead to unequal distribution of assets against the established ownership percentages.",

Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",
        "explanation": "The Joint Venture wants to opt out of being treated like a partnership. However, they still allocate profit and loss at a percentage, similar to a partnership. Also, by excluding themselves from subchapter K, they may not be able to take advantage of certain tax benefits. ",

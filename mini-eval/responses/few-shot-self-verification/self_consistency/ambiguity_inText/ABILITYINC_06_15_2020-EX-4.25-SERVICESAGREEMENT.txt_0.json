In the modified version, Provider is not obligated to any additional services, creating an uncertainty regarding the Provider's responsibility and could lead to a dispute if additional service is required.",

        "explanation": "Adding 'if both parties agree it is related to the services' makes it ambiguous and is a in-text contradiction. It introduces ambiguity and contradiction to the ownership of intellectual property. Previously, Recipient automatically owned IP created by Provider. The changed text states that the creation of IP must be agreed by both parties, meaning if the Provider does not believe so, they will retain ownership.",

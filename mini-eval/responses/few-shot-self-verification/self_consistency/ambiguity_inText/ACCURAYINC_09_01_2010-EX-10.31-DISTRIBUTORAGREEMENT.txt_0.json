        "section": "1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions specifically for CyberKnife products and services (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America), APAC (Asia Pacific, excluding Australia, India, and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and Japan.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Accuray Regions\" excludes Australia, India, and Japan from APAC, but then includes Japan as a separate region. This is an in-text contradiction as Japan cannot be both excluded from and included as a region.",

Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence indicates that a failure to respond to a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes a disapproval. However, the second sentence states that a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray, implying an active acceptance is required. This creates ambiguity because if no one responds within two weeks, it is deemed unapproved, but the second sentence says it is only accepted once an authorized representative of Accuray signs the Purchase Order.",

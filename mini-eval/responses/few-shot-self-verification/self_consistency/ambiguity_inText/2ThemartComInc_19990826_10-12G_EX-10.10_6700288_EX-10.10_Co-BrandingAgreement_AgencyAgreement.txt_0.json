        "section": "(c) \"CUSTOMERS\" means all users who access Co-Branded Site and complete at least one transaction per month.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is ambiguous because it requires completing at least one transaction per month, which is highly restrictive. This could exclude casual users who access the site but do not make monthly transactions, creating confusion about who actually qualifies as a customer under the agreement.",

After Launch Date, 2TheMart will widely promote the Services: (a) To every seller and high bidder through means including, but not limited to, end of auction emails containing links, such that, it shall be possible for the buyer or seller to initiate a Transaction Inquiry with i-Escrow, without having to re-enter all their personal or transaction related information.",
        "explanation": "This clause creates ambiguity, as it requires 2TheMart to promote the services 'widely' to every seller and high bidder, but the specific means include only end-of-auction emails. If 2TheMart chooses to only use end-of-auction emails, it can be argued that they are not 'widely' promoting, creating a contradiction in how much they promote the services.",

        "explanation": "This clause outlines the potential revision of advertising fees based on market conditions, but it does not provide any specific mechanism or criteria for determining what constitutes 'present market conditions.'

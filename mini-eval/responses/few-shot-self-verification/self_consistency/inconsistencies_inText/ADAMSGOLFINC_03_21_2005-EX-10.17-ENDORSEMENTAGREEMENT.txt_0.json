        "explanation": "The contract states a start date but uses redacted information for the number of years and months of the agreement, as well as the termination date, making the actual term length ambiguous. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to determine the contract's duration and obligations.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if the consultant is terminated for cause they shall be required to pay Adams Golf for the period not performed unless the termination is due to Adams Golf failing to provide adequate product per section 17A. This is contradictory since if the Consultant is terminated for cause, it is for a breach of contract, and should not warrant a repayment unless it is due to the consultant's actions. This creates ambiguity in termination conditions and repayment.",

        "explanation": "This section seems out of place within the 'PERFORMANCE BONUSES AND TOTAL COMPENSATION LIMITATION' section and seems like it should be with the TERMINATION clauses. It seems as if the structural flow is not correct.",

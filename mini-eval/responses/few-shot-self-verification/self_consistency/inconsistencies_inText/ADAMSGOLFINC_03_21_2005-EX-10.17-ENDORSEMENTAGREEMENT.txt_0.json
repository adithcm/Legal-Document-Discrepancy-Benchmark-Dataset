        "section": "B.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. However, in certain extenuating circumstances determined solely by the consultant, payment may be delayed up to 90 days with written notification. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "This creates an inconsistency in the payment terms. The first sentence states that payment should be made within one month of the calendar year end (e.g., by January 31st). However, the second sentence allows for a delay of up to 90 days under certain extenuating circumstances decided solely by the consultant, with only written notification required. The repayment schedule is not aligned with the ability of the consultant to delay payment.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "The text presents a contradiction on whether or not repayment is required if the consultant is unable to perform. The first sentence states no repayment shall be required due to injury from an Adams Golf promotional event; however, the next sentence states that the consultant shall be required to repay Adams Golf for that period of the Agreement.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT, unless the termination is due to ADAMS GOLF consistently failing to provide adequate product as outlined in section 17A. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This text is structurally flawed because the term used, 'Failure to play' is contradictory to the language in this text and does not make sense. There is no failure to play involved in this clause. The section focuses on the recourse for a breach of the agreement and outlines the process for terminating the contract due to a material breach.",

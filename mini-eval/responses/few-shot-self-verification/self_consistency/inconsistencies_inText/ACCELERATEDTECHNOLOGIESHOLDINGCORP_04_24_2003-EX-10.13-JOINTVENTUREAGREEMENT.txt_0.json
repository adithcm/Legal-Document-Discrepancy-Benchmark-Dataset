        "explanation": "Section 1.3 and 1.4 does not mention anything about when the payment needs to be paid. However, the following sentence states that payments must be paid within 15 days of receipt. This can be confusing because the parties may need to refer to other documents to find the payment date. The terms in section 1.3 and 1.4 does not align with the sentence that follows.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence states all payments will be paid by Adaptimmune within 45 days of receipt, but the sentence that follows states that if MD Anderson delivers the invoice in person, payments will be paid within 10 days. This is a contradiction because it does not make it clear when payments will be paid.",

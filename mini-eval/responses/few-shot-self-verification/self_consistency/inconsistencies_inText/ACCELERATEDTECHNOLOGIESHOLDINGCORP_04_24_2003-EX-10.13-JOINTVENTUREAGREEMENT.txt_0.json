        "section": "However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
        "explanation": "This contradicts the previous sentence stating the agreement is effective until February 28, 2004, 'unless extended by written agreement'. The ability to unilaterally terminate with 60 days' notice undermines the fixed term ending date, creating ambiguity about the actual duration of the joint venture.",

        "explanation": "Section 9 discusses distributions of gross income to the joint venturers based on their prorata interest, but this overrides it by guaranteeing PVSS a payment of $10,000 per month. This creates inconsistency in the distribution of income, especially if there's insufficient gross income to cover both prorata distributions and this payment.",

        "section": "4.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This clause allows 2TheMart to unilaterally revise the advertising fee formula without i-Escrow's consent. This creates an imbalance of power and could lead to disputes if the Adjusted Rate becomes unreasonable, making the financial obligations of i-Escrow unpredictable and potentially detrimental. It is an in-text contradiction since i-Escrow cannot adjust payments only 2TheMart can.",

        "section": "5.3 AUDIT RIGHTS. i-Escrow shall keep for one (1) year proper records and books of account relating to the computation of advertising payments owed to 2TheMart (including, as appropriate, the computation of the size of average Transaction). Once every six (6) months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with i-Escrow's business activities and with no less than fifteen (15) days notice. i-Escrow shall within two (2) months make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit. Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of five percent (5%) of the payments owed to date, i-Escrow shall immediately pay all cost of such audit.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states i-Escrow is to keep records for one year, but the following sentences provide a conflicting payment timeframe of two months, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over financial responsibilities and timelines, which is an in-text contradiction. It is not structured properly and does not make sense since it goes from one year to two months.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section includes two contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement,' but then adds that the agreement will be 'automatically renewed' if notice is not given, creating ambiguity about the actual renewal process, which is an in-text contradiction.",

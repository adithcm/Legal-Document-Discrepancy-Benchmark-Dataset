        "section": "The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions ('the Adjusted Rate'), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This clause allows 2TheMart to unilaterally change the payment terms (the Adjusted Rate) without i-Escrow's consent, creating a significant imbalance of power and potentially leading to financial unpredictability for i-Escrow. This ambiguity regarding the future cost creates a discrepancy within the contract.",

        "section": "This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This clause contains contradictory statements regarding renewal. It initially states that renewal requires mutual written agreement, but then asserts that the agreement automatically renews if neither party provides notice of non-renewal. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual process for renewal.",

        "explanation": "This section states that indemnification is required to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a 'principal' of the Indemnifying Party. This is structurally flawed, as the indemnitee would be unlikely to seek indemnification from a party for whom they are a principal. This also fails to properly identify what constitutes as the agent, therefore creating a discrepancy within the text.",

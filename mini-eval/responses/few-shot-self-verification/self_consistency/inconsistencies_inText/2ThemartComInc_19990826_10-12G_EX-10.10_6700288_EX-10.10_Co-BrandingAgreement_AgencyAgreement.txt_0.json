        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "The provision allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally revise the advertising fee formula creates an imbalance. While the initial rate is defined, the ability to change it 'unilaterally...effective immediately' without i-Escrow's consent introduces significant financial uncertainty for i-Escrow and could be deemed unconscionable.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. It states that 'all rights granted herein shall terminate' upon expiration or termination. However, it then provides an exception allowing provisions to survive termination for i-Escrow to complete pending transactions. It then states that Section 8.5 does not survive. This means the original provision will come back into play again.",

        "explanation": "The exclusion of Section 9 (Indemnity) from the surviving provisions after termination could create a significant legal loophole. If a claim arises after termination but is based on actions that occurred *during* the agreement's term, it's unclear whether the indemnification obligations still apply. This omission leaves the parties vulnerable to post-termination liabilities without a clear mechanism for recourse, which is a significant issue.",

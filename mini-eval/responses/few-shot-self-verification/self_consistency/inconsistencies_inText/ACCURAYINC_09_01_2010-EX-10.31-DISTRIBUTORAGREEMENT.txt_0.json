        "section": " Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 1.0% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "The interest rate clause creates ambiguity. It mentions 'the maximum amount permitted by applicable law' without specifying which law governs. Since the governing law is German law, the reference to an unspecified 'applicable law' is ambigious and contradiction because it conflicts the previously mentioned German Law.",

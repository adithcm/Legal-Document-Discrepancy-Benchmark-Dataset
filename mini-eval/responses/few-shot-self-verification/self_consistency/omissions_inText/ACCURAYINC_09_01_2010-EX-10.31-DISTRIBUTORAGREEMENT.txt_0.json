        "explanation": "This section specifies payment terms as net 30 days after delivery and receipt of invoice. However, 5.4.1 states that past due balances incur interest at 0.5% per month, without specifying when the 'past due' period begins. This is unclear whether the interest begins immediately after 30 days or if there's a grace period.",

        "explanation": "This sentence is a structural flaw. The sentence has too many nested clauses ('unless otherwise agreed,' 'including, without limitation,' 'pursuant to the terms'). This makes the sentence hard to understand.",

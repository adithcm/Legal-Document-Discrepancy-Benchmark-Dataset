        "explanation": "The definition of \"PRODUCT\" as simply \"golf clubs\" is too broad and misaligned. Later sections, particularly sections 5 and 6, discuss \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" that the consultant must exclusively use and endorsements of \"non-competitive product\". Since PRODUCT is defined so broadly, it creates ambiguity as to whether the exclusivity and endorsement clauses apply to all golf clubs or only specific types. This is misaligned with the intent of the contract.",

        "explanation": "The definition of \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" creates an in-text contradiction because Section 5 states that 'CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT', but the section includes the clause '(It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)'. This contradictory statement creates an ambiguity in the agreement.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "Section 7 introduces an in-text contradiction and structural flaw. The condition where Consultant finds the Mandatory Product unsuitable gives Adams Golf the option to supply acceptable product or terminate the agreement. However, if Adams Golf supplies a suitable product, the contract doesn't define next steps or obligations. This lack of clarity creates uncertainty about the Consultant's ongoing obligations or the agreement's continuation.",

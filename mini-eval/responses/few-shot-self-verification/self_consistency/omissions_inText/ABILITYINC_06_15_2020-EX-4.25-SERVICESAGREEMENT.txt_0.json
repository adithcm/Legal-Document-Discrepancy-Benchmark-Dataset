        "explanation": "The text defines 'Recipient' as both TELCOSTAR PTE, LTD. and Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd.

        "explanation": "The governing law is the State of Israel, but the agreement allows the Recipient to seek injunctive relief in any country where the Provider breaches the agreement. This is a legal contradiction because it is unclear which country's laws would apply to the injunction, given the contract specifies Israeli law.",

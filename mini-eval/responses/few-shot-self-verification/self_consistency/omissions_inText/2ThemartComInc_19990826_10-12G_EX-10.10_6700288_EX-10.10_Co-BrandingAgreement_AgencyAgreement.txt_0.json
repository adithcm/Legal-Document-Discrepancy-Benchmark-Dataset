        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity because it allows termination if the launch date doesn't occur within 4 months, but also states that only the party using 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' can terminate. It is unclear how it will be determined whether the party can terminate if one party did not contribute properly.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section is confusing and contradictory. It states the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then also says if either party doesn't give notice, the term is automatically renewed. This means that it can be renewed automatically and does not have to be a written agreement. This creates ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "Section 12.4 contains a contradiction. It states that force majeure does not limit obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification). This means a party is still responsible for indemnification even if the cause is due to events beyond their control. It contradicts the general idea of force majeure, which is to excuse a party from performance when events beyond their control occur.",

        "explanation": "The sentence structure in this section is flawed and unclear. The phrase 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement' does not logically connect, making it difficult to understand when the agreement is considered effective.",

        "section": "Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause. However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "The text includes conflicting termination conditions. It indicates termination can occur 'at any time without cause' but also requires '90 days' prior written notice.' This creates an in-text contradiction, as 'at any time' implies immediate termination, which is not possible with a 90-day notice period. It also says, 'termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments.' This means that even though you can terminate at any time, there are still conditions for termination, but it does not specify what those commitments are.",

(d) Notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction regarding when notices sent via mail are deemed received. Subsection (d) states they are 'deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery,' which conflicts with general legal standards requiring proof of receipt. This is a legal contradiction since standard legal practice requires proof of delivery.",

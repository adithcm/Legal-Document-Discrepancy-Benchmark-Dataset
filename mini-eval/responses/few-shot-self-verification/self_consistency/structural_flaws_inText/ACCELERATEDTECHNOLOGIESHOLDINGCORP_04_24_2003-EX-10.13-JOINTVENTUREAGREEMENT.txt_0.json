        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as determined necessary by either Joint Venturer, regardless of mutual consent.",
        "explanation": "This clause allows either joint venturer to unilaterally require capital contributions, which contradicts the general principle of a joint venture needing mutual agreement, potentially leading to financial strain or disputes if one party cannot meet the demands.",

        "explanation": "The statement allows for unilateral withdrawal of funds but limits it to 10% per quarter of the capital contribution, contradicting the normal operational flow of a joint venture where such withdrawals should require mutual agreement to ensure the venture's stability.",

        "explanation": "This section restricts the transfer of interest without consent. However, combined with Section 9 allowing unilateral withdrawal of funds, it is unclear how the withdrawal impacts the overall ownership stake if one party withdraws a substantial portion of their contribution but cannot transfer the remaining interest, creating a potential structural flaw in the agreement.",

However, the added text restricts 'Accuray Regions' to only North America. This creates a contradiction, making it unclear which definition applies.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Accuray retains the right to appoint additional exclusive distributors within specific geographic territories, even if those territories overlap with the Distributor's existing customer base.",
        "explanation": "The appointment of the Distributor as a 'non-exclusive, worldwide distributor' directly contradicts the statement that Accuray retains the right to appoint additional 'exclusive distributors' within specific geographic territories. This raises questions about the actual exclusivity afforded to Siemens and the geographical limits of their distribution rights.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor ('Warranty Period')....However, Accuray warrants that the system will be free from any defects for the expected lifetime of the product.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction with the Warranty. The first part of the text limits the warranty to one year, but the following text says the system will be free of defects for the expected lifetime of the product. This creates confusion about the actual length and coverage of the warranty.",

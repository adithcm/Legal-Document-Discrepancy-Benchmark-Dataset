        "section": "This agreement shall begin upon the date of its execution by MA and acceptance in writing by Company and shall remain in effect until the end of the current calendar year and shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods unless otherwise terminated according to the cancellation or termination provisions contained in paragraph 18 of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The agreement's term is initially defined until the end of the current calendar year, with automatic renewal unless terminated as per paragraph 18. This creates ambiguity regarding the initial term's length, as it could be significantly less than a year depending on the execution date.",

        "section": "A LATE PAYMENT CHARGE of one and one-half percent (1 %) or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, of the outstanding balance due to Company per month will be imposed on all overdue accounts.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the late payment charge. It states one and one-half percent (1 %) which represents 1%. This contradicts the statement of one and one-half percent which would represent 1.5%.",

MA acknowledges that the Company License Agreement/ Client Registration Card specifies the terms under which a Client receives, holds and uses the Package or Service.",
        "explanation": "The phrasing 'Package or Service' is ambiguous. Throughout the document, the primary subject being licensed and marketed is referred to as 'Technology.' The introduction of 'Package or Service' without clear definition creates confusion about whether these terms are interchangeable with 'Technology' or refer to something else entirely.",

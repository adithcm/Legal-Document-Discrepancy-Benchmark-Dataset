        "section": "Bizzingo agrees that any use of the Property for advertising, promotional or sale purposes will be approved in advance by Theismann. Theismann agrees that such material, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Bizzingo to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by the Theismann in writing within fourteen (14) days after Theismanns receipt thereof. Theismann agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Theismann shall advise Bizzingo in writing of the specific grounds therefor at the time of disapproval and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials. Bizzingo thereafter shall have the right and privileged to use such Property as provided in this Agreement subject to such changes or alterations.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the text regarding the approval process. Initially, it states that Theismann's approval is required for any use of his property. However, it then states that if Theismann doesn't disapprove in writing within 14 days, the material is 'deemed' approved by Bizzingo. This contradicts the initial requirement of explicit approval and creates ambiguity. It also is an inconsistency because it says Theismann will advise Bizzingo in writing if disapproved and provide Bizzingo with specific changes or alterations to such materials but then says that Bizzingo can make changes as they see fit.",

        "explanation": "This section includes ambiguity in the legal terms. The term 'pre-existing license' is vague. It does not specify what constitutes a 'pre-existing license,' leading to potential disputes over what licenses are exempt from the restriction. For example, does it include licenses that are in negotiation but not finalized? Does it need to be a formal written agreement, or can it be a verbal agreement? The language is too open to interpretation.",

Parties all consent to the jurisdiction of such courts, agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any jurisdictional or venue defenses otherwise available to it",
        "explanation": "This section contains inconsistent legal terms. It states that all disputes will be settled by arbitration, but then the sentence immediately following that gives consent to the jurisdiction of such courts, meaning litigation and not arbitration. This is a contradiction because arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution method that takes place outside of the courts.",

        "explanation": "The definition of Beverage Agreement refers to a specific agreement with Pepsi dated January 1, 2011. However, Section 3.4 states that the service will not contain any material that depicts or advertises products competitive to the Beverage Agreement. This creates a conflict because while Pepsi is protected, there's no reciprocal agreement preventing Pepsi from advertising competitors of Network Affiliate, potentially harming their business.",

Upon payment of such amount to NCM by Network Affiliate at the time of such expiration or termination, NCMs ownership interest in the NCM Equipment will transfer to Network Affiliate.",
        "explanation": "This section has structural flaws because it implies that if the equipment is fully depreciated then there is no value, but it should specifically state that no payment will be made if the NCM Equipment is fully depreciated.",

        "explanation": "This sentence is unclear and creates ambiguity.  'Make goods' are a remedy for undelivered advertising, and 'remnant advertising' typically refers to unsold inventory offered at a discount. The phrase 'other revenue-generating advertising' is too broad. This creates ambiguity as to how unsold inventory will be handled and whether Network Affiliate benefits or is harmed by it.",

        "section": "CONTRACT PERIOD means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties and terminating on May 31, 2016 unless sooner terminated under this Agreement. b) SERVICES PERIOD means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties and terminating on May 31, 2014 unless sooner terminated under this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The contract period is defined until May 31, 2016, but the services period is defined until May 31, 2014. This means that Auriemma is granting Berkshire the right to use his identification until 2016 but is only contracted to provide services until 2014. This seems inconsistent. What happens between 2014 and 2016? Can Berkshire still use Auriemma's likeness without him providing services? This is an inconsistency in the agreement's terms.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction. It states that a material breach includes failure to make payment (i), but then states that failure to observe obligations excludes payments of money (ii). The second part is contradictory as it includes the same issue that the first part of the sentence covers. This creates ambiguity.",

The parties irrevocably submit and consent to the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over each of the parties by the federal and/or state courts in such jurisdiction (the Selected Jurisdiction).",
        "explanation": "This section regarding arbitration proceedings contains a structural flaw. It is excessively long and convoluted, making it difficult to understand the intended process for resolving disputes. The parenthetical explanation of injunctive relief interrupts the flow of the sentence and adds to the confusion. Additionally, the phrase 'party not initiating such action or proceeding defendant or responding party' is grammatically incorrect and further obscures the meaning.",

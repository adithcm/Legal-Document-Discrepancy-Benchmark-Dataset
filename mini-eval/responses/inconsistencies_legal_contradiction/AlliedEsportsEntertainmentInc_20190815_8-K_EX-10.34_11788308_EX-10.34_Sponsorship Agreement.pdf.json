        "section": "This Agreement shall be valid for five (5) years from February 1, 2019 through January 31, 2024 unless this Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to Section 14 (the Term). For the purpose of clarity, the second year of this Agreement starts February 1, 2020, and the third year of this Agreement starts February 1, 2021 the fourth year of this Agreement starts February 1, 2022, and the fifth and final year of this Agreement starts February 1, 2023.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states the term is valid until January 31, 2024. However, the breakdown of each year indicates the fifth year starts February 1, 2023. This implies the agreement ends January 31, 2023 and not January 31, 2024, creating a one-year discrepancy.",

        "explanation": "Section 14.2 allows for termination after Contract Year 2 with 60 days notice. However, Section 14.4 states conditions for breach within the first two contract years, implying restrictions on termination during that period. This creates ambiguity because it doesn't explicitly state whether termination for convenience is also restricted during the first two years.",

        "section": "Before any Party (the Complaining Party) may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the Non Complaining Party), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Partys complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrators award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",
        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting clauses. It first mandates a good faith attempt to resolve disputes privately for 30 days before any legal proceeding. However, it then states that disputes shall be determined by arbitration. Finally, it adds that this section does not preclude or place any condition on any party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. It is contradictory because it first states that the dispute needs to be determined by arbitration, but then it states that a party can seek injunctive relief from a court, which would mean the court is deciding the dispute and not arbitration.",

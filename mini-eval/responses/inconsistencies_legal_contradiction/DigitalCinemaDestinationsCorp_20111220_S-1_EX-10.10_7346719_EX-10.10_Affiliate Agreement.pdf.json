Advertising Services means the advertising and promotional services (including the Digital Content Service, the Digital Carousel, the Traditional Content Program, Lobby Promotions and Event Sponsorships) as described in Part A of Exhibit A.",
        "explanation": "Advertising Services is defined as including Lobby Promotions and Event Sponsorships, but Exhibit A, which is supposed to describe these services, only lists Lobby Promotions. This is an omission because Event Sponsorships are included in the definition, but not in the exhibit that details the advertising services.",

Unless earlier terminated as provided below, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Date (the Initial Term) after which this Agreement may be extended on mutual agreement of the parties (a Renewal Term, and together with the Initial Term, the Term). If either party wishes to extend the Initial Term it shall provide notice to the other not later than 30 days, nor sooner than 45 days, before the end of the Initial Term. The parties shall then engage in discussions regarding renewal for a period of 5 days. If no agreement is reached during that 5-day period, then neither party shall have any obligation to extend this Agreement beyond the Initial Term.",
        "explanation": "The language regarding the renewal term is structurally flawed. It dictates a very short negotiation period (5 days) which is inconsistent with typical business practices for contract renewals, potentially disadvantaging one party. This creates a structural flaw because the short negotiation timeframe may not allow for sufficient due diligence or bargaining.",

        "section": "5.1 LICENSOR is the owner of all intellectual property rights, including without limitation, any and all patents, utility models, trade marks, rights in designs, trade, business or domain names, know-how, rights in databases and copyrights, rights in inventions, ideas, concepts, trade secrets and confidential information which have to be given to fulfill this contract.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the Licensor owns all intellectual property rights that 'have to be given to fulfill this contract.' This phrase is ambiguous. Intellectual property rights are generally owned, licensed, or otherwise controlled; they are not typically 'given' to fulfill a contract. The intended meaning is unclear. Does it mean the Licensor owns all IP necessary to perform the contract, or that the Licensor is transferring ownership of all listed IP to plan_b? The latter is highly unlikely given the rest of the agreement, but the phrasing creates uncertainty.",

The Initial Term shall automatically be extended for an additional period of half a year unless either party provides the other party with written notification of termination of the letter Agreement at least 60 days prior to end of such period.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the term and renewal of the agreement. It states that the initial term is 24 months and automatically extends for an *additional period of half a year* unless a party gives 60 days written notice of termination. This is ambiguious because it is unclear if after the automatic six month renewal is up, will it keep renewing every six months? This needs to be specified.",

The courts of competent jurisdiction at New York City, New York, shall have the exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "While it's common to specify a governing law and jurisdiction, stating that the agreement is governed by 'the laws of the United States of America' is too broad. US contract law is primarily state-specific. Specifying a state (e.g., 'the laws of the State of New York') provides much more clarity and certainty. Federal law would only apply to the extent federal questions (e.g., intellectual property issues under federal law) are involved. This broad statement creates ambiguity and potential conflict.",

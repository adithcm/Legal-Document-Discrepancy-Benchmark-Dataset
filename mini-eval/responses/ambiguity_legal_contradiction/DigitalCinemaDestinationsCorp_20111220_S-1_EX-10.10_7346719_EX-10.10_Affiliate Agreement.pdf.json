Upon payment of such amount to NCM by Network Affiliate at the time of such expiration or termination, NCMs ownership interest in the NCM Equipment will transfer to Network Affiliate.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that upon termination, the Network Affiliate must purchase the remaining depreciated value of the small d equipment from NCM. However, it doesn't specify the method of determining this value clearly. The term 'value...that remains on NCM's financial statements' is ambiguous. It's unclear what accounting method will be used to determine this value, potentially leading to disputes.",

However, Exhibit B can be modified from time to time (as stated in the definition of 'Theatres'). This creates a contradiction: NCM can terminate if service to Exhibit B theaters is discontinued, but Exhibit B can change, making it unclear which theaters are relevant for this termination clause at any given time. What happens if theatres are added to Exhibit B after the effective date, and service is discontinued to those theatres?",

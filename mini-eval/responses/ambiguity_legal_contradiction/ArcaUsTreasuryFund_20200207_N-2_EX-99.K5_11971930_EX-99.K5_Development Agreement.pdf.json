        "section": "WHEREAS, the Blockchain Administrator will also serve as the Fund's investment adviser (the \"Adviser\") pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement entered into by and between the Fund and the Adviser (as amended from time to time, the \"Advisory Agreement\") and WHEREAS, the Fund bears all costs and expenses incurred in its operation, administration and transactions which are not specifically assumed by the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement or this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces ambiguity regarding the relationship between the Blockchain Administrator and the Adviser. It states that the Blockchain Administrator will *also* serve as the Fund's investment adviser, implying a dual role. However, it doesn't explicitly clarify if the Blockchain Administrator and the Adviser are the same entity or separate entities operating under different agreements. This lack of clarity can lead to confusion about responsibilities and liabilities.",

        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency. It first states that the Blockchain Administrator will furnish advice and recommendations regarding the business and affairs of the fund. However, it then explicitly states that the Blockchain Administrator will *not* provide any advice relating to the securities the Fund should purchase. This contradictory statement creates confusion about the scope of the Blockchain Administrator's advisory role.",

The provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and the Blockchain Administrator shall remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. Further, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this Agreement as aforesaid, the Blockchain Administrator shall be entitled to any amounts owed under Section 4 through the date of termination or expiration, and Section 5 shall continue in force and effect and apply to the Blockchain Administrator and its representatives as and to the extent applicable.",
        "explanation": "This section has a structural flaw in the text. The sentences 'The provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and the Blockchain Administrator shall remain entitled to the benefits thereof, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement.' and 'Further, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this Agreement as aforesaid, the Blockchain Administrator shall be entitled to any amounts owed under Section 4 through the date of termination or expiration, and Section 5 shall continue in force and effect and apply to the Blockchain Administrator and its representatives as and to the extent applicable.' are repetitive. The second sentance is not needed as it is saying the same thing as the first sentance.",

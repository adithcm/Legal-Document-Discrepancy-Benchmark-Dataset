        "section": "This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a structural flaw in the text. The phrase \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement\" is grammatically incorrect and doesn't clearly state when the agreement becomes effective. It appears to be a repetition or a combination of clauses, which makes the intended meaning unclear. It should state a clear effective date.",

        "explanation": "This clause stipulates which sections survive the termination of the agreement. Section 2.2 is regarding the terms of payment and related matters, Section 4 is confidentiality, Section 5 is indemnification and Section 6 is miscellaneous. This creates an issue because Section 3.6 dictates what happens upon expiration or termination of this agreement. This creates an issue with obligations between both parties. This is an inconsistency because it does not state which section takes precidence and what must happen. It is ambigious in how to enforce upon termination.",

This may be interpreted as a misalighment, since there is no clear definition of intellectual property.",

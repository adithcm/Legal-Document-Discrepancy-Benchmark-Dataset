        "explanation": "The sentence is structurally flawed and does not read as proper English. The phrase \"Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement\" is nonsensical and adds nothing to the actual meaning of the agreement, and it is not a proper way to begin a sentence. It should be reworded to establish a clear and proper meaning for this section.",

(a) As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the compensation terms, stating that the recipient will pay the provider's actual cost plus a 10% service fee, in addition to reimbursing for out-of-pocket costs. The term \"actual cost\" is ambiguous. Without a clear definition of \"actual cost,\" disputes may arise regarding what expenses are included and how they are calculated. For example, does it include overhead, administrative costs, or a portion of employee salaries? This lack of clarity can lead to disagreements and potentially litigation.",

Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses of the Provider Representatives will be set out in Exhibit A. However, Exhibit A only lists \"Services\" and does not mention any names, positions, experience or licenses. This is an omission in text because Section 1.2(c) references Exhibit A, but the information is not included, which creates a contradiction.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow without requiring i-Escrow's consent. This creates a significant imbalance of power, as 2TheMart can effectively dictate the financial terms of the agreement after the Launch Date. While the clause mentions adjusting the rate to 'reflect present market conditions,' this is vague and doesn't prevent 2TheMart from arbitrarily increasing the fees, potentially making the agreement financially unsustainable for i-Escrow. Also, the last sentence in this section says that the rate will be effective immediately, which puts I-Escrow at a disadvantage, as the rate may not be fair.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The automatic renewal clause contradicts the requirement for 'mutual written agreement' for renewal. The statement that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year, making renewal automatic without the need for mutual agreement. This creates ambiguity as to whether renewal requires active agreement or simply a lack of objection.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction regarding which provisions survive termination. The initial statement indicates that 'all rights granted herein shall terminate,' which is consistent with a clean break upon termination. However, the subsequent sentence states that 'all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination.' The last sentence then states that Sections 1, 7, 8.5, 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement. This is a contradiction.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall not be required to wear ADAMS GOLF [*****] in [*****] ads.",
        "explanation": "This clause contradicts the general exclusivity provisions outlined in 4A, 4B, and 4C, but its vagueness creates ambiguity. The lack of specificity regarding the type of ads ([*****] ads) and the apparel ([*****]) allows for multiple interpretations, undermining the intended exclusivity. It's unclear what constitutes a '[*****] ad,' potentially leading to disputes.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'at every opportunity' lacks clear boundaries and conflicts with Section 11.A, which states appearances need to be 'compatible with CONSULTANT'S own practice, play and personal time requirements.' This creates an internal contradiction. One section mandates promotion 'at every opportunity,' while the other acknowledges CONSULTANT'S time constraints. This contradiction makes it difficult to determine the exact promotional obligations of CONSULTANT.",

CONSULTANT will be required to be available after a tournament for selected interviews, either the Sunday afternoon or Monday morning following the tournament.",
        "explanation": "The statement that 'CONSULTANT will be required to be available after a tournament for selected interviews, either the Sunday afternoon or Monday morning following the tournament' creates an inconsistency, where the first sentence states the interviews are 'compatible with CONSULTANT'S own practice, play and personal time requirements'. This vague language can lead to conflict between both parties as there is no clearly defined obligations.",

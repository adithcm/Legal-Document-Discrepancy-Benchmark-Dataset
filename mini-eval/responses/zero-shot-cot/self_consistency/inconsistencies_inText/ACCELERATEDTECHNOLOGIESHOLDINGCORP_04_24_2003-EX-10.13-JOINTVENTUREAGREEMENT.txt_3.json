        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture shall be made.",
        "explanation": "This section grants broad authority to each Joint Venturer to execute instruments, but then immediately restricts that authority with three provisos requiring both Joint Venturers' consent. This creates a contradiction because it's unclear when a single Joint Venturer can act independently versus when both are required to consent. The phrase 'except as provided for below' is vague and doesn't clearly delineate the boundaries of each Joint Venturer's authority, leading to potential disputes.",

        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the conditions for distributions, stating they can only be made if assets exceed liabilities and must be distributed ratably according to Section 6. However, it then introduces an exception: PVSS receives a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of profitability. This contradicts the initial condition that distributions depend on the Joint Venture's assets exceeding its liabilities. The 'notwithstanding the foregoing' clause creates a direct conflict in the distribution terms, making it unclear when the general rule or the exception applies.",

Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the procedure for asset distribution upon termination, stating that if the Parties cannot agree on the value of an asset, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. has the final say. This implies that the decision-making power in this scenario is not equally distributed between the Joint Venturers. This could be viewed as contradiction because it favors one party in the final stages of the joint venture.",

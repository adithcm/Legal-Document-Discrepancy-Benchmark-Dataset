        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity due to the numerous redactions ([*****]). The redacted content makes it impossible to fully understand the scope and limitations of the consultant's endorsement rights for [*****]. For instance, it's unclear what specific actions the consultant must take to 'remedy the situation' if their use varies from past practice. It is unknown the limitations and/or the specifics of what is expected in this situation. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to enforce specific obligations or determine breaches of contract.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the use of non-Adams Golf clubs. While it states that the consultant may play other clubs, including a putter, it also states that the consultant 'may not endorse those clubs'. The term 'endorse' is not specifically defined within this section, making it unclear what actions would constitute an endorsement. Would simply using the club in a visible manner be considered an endorsement, even if the consultant does not explicitly promote it? This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine if the consultant is in breach of contract if they use a non-Adams Golf club.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a few discrepancies. The term 'satisfactory record of play' is not defined. What is considered satisfactory? Also, the minimum number of events is redacted, making it impossible to understand the consultant's minimum obligation. Without knowing what a 'satisfactory record' means or the minimum number of events, it's impossible to enforce this section of the agreement.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray. ",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the purchase order process, stating Accuray must accept or reject a Purchase Order within two weeks, failure to do so implies disapproval. However, it also states that the purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray, implying acceptance only occurs with explicit execution. This creates an inconsistency, as it is not clear if Accuray's silence for two weeks means disapproval or if the Purchase Order still requires an authorized signature for acceptance.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses the responsibility for expedited shipping costs based on the delivery deadline requested in the Purchase Order. It states that Accuray bears the costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. The example provided illustrates this, but the wording \"at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor\" is vague. Does the day of submission count towards the six months, or does the six month period start the day after submission? This ambiguity can lead to disputes about who pays for expedited shipping.",

        "section": "4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider).",
        "explanation": "This section defines the warranty period as one year following installation, but not exceeding 18 months after shipment. It also requires the Distributor to notify Accuray within 10 days following installation if Accuray does not perform the installation. However, it does not specify the consequences if the Distributor fails to notify Accuray within this 10-day period. Does it void the warranty or simply complicate the warranty claim process? This lack of clarity creates a potential ambiguity.",

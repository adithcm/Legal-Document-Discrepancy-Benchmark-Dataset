        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Accuray has two weeks to either accept or reject the Purchase Order, and failure to do so constitutes disapproval. However, the subsequent sentence states that each purchase shall be accomplished, and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. This second sentence creates an ambiguity. Does Accuray's failure to execute the Purchase order within two weeks mean disapproval, or does it just mean the purchase is not 'accomplished'? This creates an inconsistency in how acceptance of a purchase order is defined.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the responsibility for expedited shipping costs based on the requested delivery date in relation to the purchase order submission date. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order, Accuray bears the expedited costs. However, the phrasing \"at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor\" is ambiguous. Does the day of submission count towards the six months, or does the six-month period begin the day after submission? This ambiguity in the definition of 'at least six months' creates potential disputes regarding who is responsible for expedited shipping costs.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "This section allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fees paid by i-Escrow without requiring i-Escrow's consent. While the section states that the adjusted rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately, it does not provide any constraints on how much the rate can be adjusted or how frequently. This gives 2TheMart complete control over the advertising fees, which can be seen as an omission of fair market value, which would be illegal.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding the renewal of the agreement. It initially states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement' but then states, 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' This suggests that the agreement is automatically renewed unless either party provides notice of non-renewal, which contradicts the initial requirement of mutual written agreement. This makes the renewal ambiguous.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section details the effects of termination but then creates an omission and lists sections that shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement. Section 8.5 is listed as not surviving the termination of the agreement, but the same section states what happens upon termination of the agreement. If this section does not survive termination, how can any of these effects be implemented?",

The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section allows the consultant to endorse and play a product that is not ADAMS GOLF's. It also states that the consultant will wear his ADAMS GOLF apparel during photo shoots. However, it is not clear what happens when the endorsement is over and there is no more product from the prior endorsement and what apparel the consultant will wear. Since it is implied he has to wear ADAMS GOLF apparel, there is a conflict of interest here. Since there is no clarity on what will happen, the text is ambiguous.",

ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
        "explanation": "The language within section 12, particularly 'public morals and conventions,' 'public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule,' and 'insults or offends the community,' is highly subjective and open to interpretation. What constitutes a violation of 'public morals' can vary greatly depending on cultural norms, geographic location, and individual perspectives, making it difficult to establish a clear and objective standard for compliance. Similarly, the threshold for bringing someone into 'public disrepute' or causing 'scandal' can be ambiguous and dependent on public sentiment, which can fluctuate over time. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether certain conduct warrants termination, potentially resulting in legal challenges.",

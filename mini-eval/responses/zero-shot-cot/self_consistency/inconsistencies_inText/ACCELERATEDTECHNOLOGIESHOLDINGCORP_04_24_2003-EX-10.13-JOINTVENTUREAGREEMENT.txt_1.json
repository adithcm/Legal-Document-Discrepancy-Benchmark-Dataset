        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "While this statement itself isn't contradictory, it creates a potential omission when read in conjunction with Section 9 regarding distributions. Section 9 states that 'During the term of the Joint Venture, no interest shall be allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution.' If no capital contributions are required (Section 3), there is no 'contribution' upon which interest is disallowed, rendering part of Section 9 nonsensical. This implies either a capital contribution *should* exist or the clause regarding interest is irrelevant and potentially misleading.",

        "explanation": "The initial statement grants either Joint Venturer authority to execute instruments, implying independent action. However, the subsequent provisos severely restrict this authority by requiring mutual consent for incurring liability, disposing of assets, or making purchase commitments. This creates an in-text contradiction as the initial grant of authority is almost entirely negated by the limitations.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This clause in Section 9 contradicts the general principle outlined in the initial part of Section 9, which states that 'there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6.' The guaranteed payment to PVSS regardless of profitability violates the condition that distributions are based on available gross income and only if assets exceed liabilities. It also goes against the prorata distribution rule as PVSS receives a fixed amount irrespective of their ownership percentage or the financial state of the joint venture.",

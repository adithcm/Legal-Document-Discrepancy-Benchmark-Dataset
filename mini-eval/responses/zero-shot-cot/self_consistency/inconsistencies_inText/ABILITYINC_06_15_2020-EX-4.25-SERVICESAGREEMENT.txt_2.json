        "section": "This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",
        "explanation": "The sentence structure is flawed and contains repetition (\"Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement\"). It should clearly state the agreement's duration and termination conditions without the grammatical error. The duplication of 'Agreement' and the awkward phrasing make it difficult to understand the intended meaning clearly.",

        "explanation": "This section appears to be overly broad in its assignment of intellectual property rights. It states that Recipient owns all rights to anything conceived by Provider while working for Recipient, even if 'suggested by' or 'results from' the services. This is ambiguous. The interpretation could lead to a dispute, particularly if the Provider develops something only tangentially related to the services, especially considering that the agreement does not define 'suggested by' or 'results from'.",

        "explanation": "Section 3.1 states that this agreement shall terminate on December 31, 2020. However, Section 2.2(c) states that the Provider shall allow the Recipient to use a product at no cost until December 31, 2021. This is an in-text contradiction. After the termination of the contract, the Provider is still obligated to provide something for free.",

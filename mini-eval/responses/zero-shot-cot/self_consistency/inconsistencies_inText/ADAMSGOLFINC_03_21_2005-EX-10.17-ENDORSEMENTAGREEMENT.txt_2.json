        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section provides an exception to the exclusivity clause outlined in paragraphs 4A, 4B, and 4C, allowing the Consultant to endorse and play [*****]. However, the conditions surrounding this exception are vague and undefined due to redactions. The phrase \"executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers\" lacks concrete details regarding what constitutes \"consistent\" practice or how \"similarly situated\" golfers are defined. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine the scope and limitations of the exception, potentially leading to disputes over whether specific endorsements fall within the permissible boundaries.",

(It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section states that the CONSULTANT must exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, but then immediately provides an exception allowing the CONSULTANT to use clubs from other manufacturers, including a putter, as long as they don't endorse those clubs. This creates an in-text contradiction. The term \"exclusively\" implies a complete restriction, but the parenthetical statement allows for the use of competitor's products under certain conditions, thus creating conflicting obligations.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. However, should the failure to play be due to an injury sustained during an Adams Golf promotional event, no repayment shall be required. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section deals with termination due to the consultant's inability to play golf. It initially states that if the consultant dies or is unable to play, ADAMS GOLF can terminate the agreement. It further clarifies that if the inability to play is due to an injury during an ADAMS GOLF promotional event, no repayment is required. However, the following sentence, \"Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT,\" creates an inconsistency. The previous sentence provides an exception to the repayment in the event of injury, but the subsequent sentence contradicts this by mandating repayment upon termination regardless.",

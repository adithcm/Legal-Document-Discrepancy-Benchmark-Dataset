        "section": "The Joint Venturers shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture. The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses. It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture shall be made.",
        "explanation": "This section grants each Joint Venturer authority to execute instruments but immediately restricts that authority by requiring mutual consent for key financial and asset-related decisions. The initial grant of 'full and complete charge of all affairs' is significantly curtailed by the subsequent restrictions. This creates a misalignment between the stated broad authority and the limitations imposed, potentially leading to disputes about the scope of each venturer's individual power.",

        "section": "Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
        "explanation": "This section details distribution guidelines but creates a contradiction with PVSS's guaranteed payment. The initial statement restricts distributions to situations where assets exceed liabilities and requires prorata distribution. However, the subsequent clause guarantees PVSS a $10,000 monthly payment, irrespective of profitability or the asset-liability balance. This contradicts the initial distribution rules, potentially allowing PVSS to receive payments even when the Joint Venture is insolvent or other liabilities are not met, disadvantaging CCGI.",

        "section": "Procedure on Termination and Liquidation. On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets. However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
        "explanation": "The clause provides a procedure for liquidation, including the distribution of assets. It states that if the parties cannot agree on the value of an asset, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. has the final say. This creates an imbalance of power during the liquidation process, as CCGI can unilaterally determine the value of assets, potentially to the detriment of PVSS. This arrangement could lead to unfair distribution of assets, especially if CCGI undervalues certain assets to gain a larger share of the liquidation proceeds.",

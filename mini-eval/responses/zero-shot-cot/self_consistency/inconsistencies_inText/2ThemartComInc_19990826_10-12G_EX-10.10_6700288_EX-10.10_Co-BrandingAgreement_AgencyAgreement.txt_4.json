        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The language regarding automatic renewal contradicts the requirement for mutual written agreement. The paragraph states that the agreement may be renewed by mutual written agreement but then says that if notice isn't given, it will automatically renew, which circumvents the written agreement clause. This creates ambiguity about the renewal process.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the number of Transaction Inquiries. This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), unilaterally by 2TheMart without requiring i-Escrow's consent. The Adjusted Rate will be communicated to i-Escrow and will be effective immediately.",
        "explanation": "Allowing 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the advertising fee rate without i-Escrow's consent creates a significant power imbalance. While the language mentions adjusting the rate to reflect \"present market conditions,\" this is vague and could be interpreted in various ways, potentially leading to disputes. More importantly, the fact that the adjusted rate goes into effect immediately after communication to i-Escrow does not provide i-Escrow an opportunity to negotiate or terminate the agreement should the adjusted rate be unfavorable. This could be considered unconscionable.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights granted herein shall terminate, (b) i-Escrow shall pay all amounts owed to 2TheMart within thirty (30) days of termination, and (c) each party shall remove the other party's content and Marks from their servers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if this Agreement was terminated for a material breach, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary for i-Escrow to complete any Customer transactions which are pending at the time of expiration or termination. Sections 1, 7, 8.5 [EFFECTS OF TERMINATION], 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall not survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an internal contradiction regarding which sections survive termination. It states that 'all rights granted herein shall terminate' upon expiration or termination. However, it then includes a 'Notwithstanding the foregoing' clause indicating that provisions will survive termination to complete pending customer transactions, which requires some rights to continue. More specifically, it states that Section 8.5 does not survive termination, but then refers back to section 8.5. This creates confusion as to what exactly happens upon termination.",

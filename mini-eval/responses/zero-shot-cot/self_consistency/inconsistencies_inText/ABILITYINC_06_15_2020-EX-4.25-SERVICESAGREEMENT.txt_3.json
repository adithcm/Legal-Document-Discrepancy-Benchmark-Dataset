        "section": "This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2.",
        "explanation": "The sentence has a structural flaw, because it uses the term 'Agreement' twice, without any clear indication of what the first 'Agreement' is used for in the sentence. Because of this, the text sounds awkward to read.",

        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Provider Representatives will solely provide services to the Recipient. However, section 1.1 (a) states that Provider agrees to respond to requests by Recipient for additional services not currently contemplated in Exhibit A. It could be argued that additional services or resources not in the Exhibit A are not solely for the Recipient, because the Provider Representative would have to provide the services to another customer of the Provider.",

        "explanation": "This section states that Section 2.2 survives termination of the agreement. Section 2.2 outlines the Terms of Payment and Related Matters. However, Section 3.6 (e) requires the Provider to repay fees and expenses paid in advance for services not provided on a pro rata basis. This contradicts the survival of Section 2.2, because it would imply that the payment terms, including reimbursement upon termination, still apply.",

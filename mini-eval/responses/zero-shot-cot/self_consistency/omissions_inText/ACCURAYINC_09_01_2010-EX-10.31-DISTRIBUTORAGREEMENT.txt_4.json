        "explanation": "This definition is circular and unhelpful. It defines the term as simply \"a purchase,\" which provides no specific meaning or context. This lack of clarity undermines the purpose of having a defined term and creates ambiguity as to what qualifies as a Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase under the agreement. It provides no context as to a specific condition that needs to be met to be considered a purchase.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in who bears the supplementary shipping costs. The section states that Accuray will bear the costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the example provided illustrates a scenario where the Purchase Order is submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months). According to the general rule, Accuray should bear the costs. However, the example clarifies that for the expenses to be borne by Accuray, it has to be at least six months and the example is exactly six months. This contradicts the first statement as the example should have the opposite conclusion.",

        "explanation": "This section specifies that the remaining balance is due 30 days after delivery and receipt of a reasonably undisputed invoice. However, Section 5.5 states that Distributor is responsible for the creditworthiness of customers and must pay Accuray regardless of whether the Distributor collects from its customers. If the Customer is paying Accuray directly in Section 5.4.3, then the Distributor should not be held liable if Accuray is not being paid on time. This creates a conflict and ambiguity about payment responsibility.",

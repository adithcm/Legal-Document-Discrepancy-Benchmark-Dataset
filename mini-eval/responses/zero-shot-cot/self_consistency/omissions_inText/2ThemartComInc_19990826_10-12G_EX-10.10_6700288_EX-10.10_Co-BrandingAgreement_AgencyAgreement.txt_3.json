        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. First, it states the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement. Then, it states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. These two provisions contradict each other; one requires active agreement, while the other implies automatic renewal without explicit agreement. This creates ambiguity as to how the contract is actually renewed.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "Section 8.2(a) states that a party may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach. However, the opening sentence of Section 8.2 states that a party may *immediately* terminate the Agreement, suggesting no cure period is necessary. This creates a contradiction as it's unclear whether a material breach allows for immediate termination or requires a 60-day cure period.",

In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "This section of the agreement is an example of structural flaws in text. The way that this is written is confusing and ambiguous. After the first sentence, the agreement makes two additional statements where the first company '2TheMart' must idemnify 'i-Escrow'. Then it goes on to say 'i-Escrow' will indemnify '2TheMart'. The structure of this makes it hard to understand.",

        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that the consultant must play a *minimum* number of events to avoid repayment. However, it doesn't define what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play.' This ambiguity could lead to disputes, as ADAMS GOLF could argue that even if the consultant plays the required number of events, their performance wasn't 'satisfactory,' thus triggering the repayment clause. This lacks objective criteria and gives ADAMS GOLF too much discretionary power.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause dictates repayment to Adams Golf if Watson dies or becomes unable to play, calculated as if he simply failed to meet the minimum tournament requirement outlined in 8A. However, the situations are fundamentally different. Death or permanent disability is a force majeure event, significantly distinct from a voluntary decision not to play enough tournaments. It is questionable why the estate should have to pay, when there is nothing in the contract that states he has to pay in the event of his death.",

ADAMS GOLF'S RIGHTS UPON TERMINATION A.In the event of termination of this Agreement, ADAMS GOLF shall cease using the name and/or likeness of CONSULTANT in advertising within [*****] days. B.In the event of termination of this Agreement, ADAMS GOLF shall cease using the name and/or likeness of CONSULTANT on Product within [*****] months after termination of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The clause stipulates different timeframes for ceasing the use of the consultant's name/likeness in advertising ( [*****] days) and on products ( [*****] months). However, it does not specify what type of advertising is covered. This can create issues, because the terminology used here is vague and undefined. Without clearly defining the scope of advertising, it is not clear what the intentions are.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section states that if the consultant dies or is unable to play tour golf, ADAMS GOLF can terminate the agreement, and the consultant's estate must repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period. However, it is illogical to demand repayment from the consultant's estate if the reason for termination is death or inability to play. This creates a contradiction because it imposes a financial penalty on the consultant's estate due to circumstances that are beyond the consultant's control and arguably represent a significant loss for the consultant, not a breach of contract.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination for a material breach by either party. It then stipulates that upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall repay ADAMS GOLF for the period not performed. This is contradictory because if ADAMS GOLF materially breaches the agreement, it would be unfair and illogical for CONSULTANT to be forced to repay ADAMS GOLF. Repayment should only be required if the consultant breaches the agreement. This creates an inconsistency in the application of consequences based on which party is in breach.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows: The agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year: 1. Year 1. $[*****] 2. Year 2 $[*****] 3. Year 3 $[*****] 4. Year 4 $[*****] 5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "This clause contains ambiguity regarding the definition of \"satisfactory record of play\". The contract specifies a minimum number of events the consultant must participate in, but it doesn't define what constitutes a \"satisfactory record of play\" within those events. This vagueness can lead to disputes about whether the consultant has met their obligations, even if they participate in the required number of tournaments. Without clear criteria for performance within those tournaments, ADAMS GOLF could potentially argue that the consultant's performance was unsatisfactory even if they met the minimum participation requirement, leading to a repayment demand.",

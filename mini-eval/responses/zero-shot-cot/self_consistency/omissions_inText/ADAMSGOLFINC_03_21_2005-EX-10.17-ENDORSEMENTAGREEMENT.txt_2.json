        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that the consultant must achieve a 'satisfactory record of play' in a minimum number of events. However, it fails to define what constitutes a 'satisfactory record of play'. This lack of clarity creates ambiguity, as ADAMS GOLF could argue that any performance below a certain standard is unsatisfactory, while the CONSULTANT could have a different interpretation. This can lead to disputes.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the consequences of termination due to the CONSULTANT's death or inability to play golf, requiring repayment for the unperformed period. However, this contradicts the typical legal understanding and practice regarding contract termination due to death or force majeure. Usually, contracts are discharged without penalty in such cases. Requiring the estate to repay amounts already paid is unusual and potentially unenforceable depending on jurisdiction and specific circumstances. This potentially contradicts established legal principles regarding impossibility of performance.",

        "explanation": "While this section specifies Kansas law as governing, it does not include a choice of venue or forum for dispute resolution, despite Section 33 specifying venue for arbitration as Kansas. This is an omission that could lead to confusion or legal challenges. While the arbitration venue is Kansas, if a matter is not subject to arbitration, the location of a lawsuit is not specified. It would make sense to include a clause stating that in the event arbitration is not the avenue for dispute resolution, venue is Kansas. The omission to do so, is a structural flaw in legal terms.",

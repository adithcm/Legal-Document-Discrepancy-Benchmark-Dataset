        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account.",
        "explanation": "While the Joint Venture agreement establishes a business relationship between CCGI and PVSS, the agreement explicitly states that both parties can continue to engage in their own separate businesses. This could potentially lead to conflicts of interest if the individual businesses of CCGI or PVSS directly compete with the Joint Venture. The agreement does not have any language discussing conflict resolution or mitigation.",

        "explanation": "The statement lacks specific guidelines regarding the amount, timing, and method of determining the capital contributions required from each Joint Venturer. The absence of these details creates ambiguity and potential disputes over capital contributions. There is no further clarification as to what happens if one Joint Venturer does not contribute.",

        "explanation": "Subsections (a), (b), and (c) are clear and define the scope of the business of the Joint Venture. Subsection (d) is too vague, using language such as 'necessary, advisable, or incidental', which can be interpreted in many different ways, thus leading to misinterpretation and potential legal issues. The Joint Venture can engage in an activity that one party does not agree on.",

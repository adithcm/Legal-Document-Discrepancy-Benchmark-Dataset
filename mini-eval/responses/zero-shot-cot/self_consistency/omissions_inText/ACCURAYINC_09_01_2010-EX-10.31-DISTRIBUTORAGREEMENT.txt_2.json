        "explanation": "This definition is incomplete and does not provide any clarity on what constitutes a Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchase. It simply states that it means 'a purchase' which is vague and uninformative. This lack of a clear definition can lead to confusion and disputes regarding the scope of the agreement.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.",
        "explanation": "There is conflicting information within this section. The beginning of the section states that failure to approve or disapprove within two weeks constitutes disapproval. The end of the section states, 'Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.' This creates a contradiction because the failure to respond in two weeks disapproves the purchase, but the purchase is not accomplished until the Purchase order is executed by an authorized representative of Accuray.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency regarding responsibility for expedited shipping costs. It states that if the delivery deadline requested by the Distributor is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, Accuray will bear any expedited delivery expenses. However, the wording suggests that 'any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.' This wording fails to address who is responsible for the delay in shipping that requires it to be expedited. It implies that the responsibility falls on the requesting entity of the delivery date.",

        "section": "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.",
        "explanation": "This section allows termination if the launch date isn't met within 4 months, but then restricts that right only to the party who used 'good faith and reasonable development efforts'. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes. It's unclear how 'good faith and reasonable development efforts' are defined or measured, and it places a subjective burden of proof on the party seeking to terminate. This could lead to disputes about whether the terminating party genuinely made sufficient efforts, even if the launch date was missed. There is no clear definition of what constitutes good faith, and reasonable efforts.",

This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. First, it states that the agreement may be renewed for successive one-year terms by mutual written agreement. However, it then states that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the expiration date, the agreement will be automatically renewed for another year. This creates a contradiction, as it is unclear whether a written agreement is required for renewal or whether the agreement will automatically renew without one if no notice is given.",

In addition to other remedies that may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2 [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT], 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.",
        "explanation": "This section allows for immediate termination for breaches as provided in Sections 2.2, 2.4, and 12.4. However, subsection (a) states that termination for a material breach requires a 60-day cure period. This creates an inconsistency because it is unclear whether the 60-day cure period applies to all material breaches, including those mentioned in the specified sections, or if the breaches in those sections allow for immediate termination regardless of a cure period.",

        "section": "The Joint Venturers may be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as needed.",
        "explanation": "This statement is ambiguous because it doesn't define how the need for capital contributions is determined, who decides the amount, and what happens if a Joint Venturer is unable or unwilling to contribute. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes.",

    {
        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement is too broad and doesn't specify any limitations on the authority of each Joint Venturer. It could be interpreted to mean that either Joint Venturer can unilaterally make decisions that significantly impact the Joint Venture without the other's consent, potentially leading to conflicts.",

        "section": "The fiscal year of the Joint Venture shall be the calendar year, and shall use the cash basis of accounting. If requested by a Joint Venturer, the Joint Venture books and records shall be audited as of the close of each year by an independent accountant acceptable to both Joint Venturers.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates an audit only if requested by a Joint Venturer, but doesn't specify the process or criteria for selecting an accountant if the Joint Venturers can't agree on one. This omission creates a potential for deadlock and ambiguity in the accounting process, potentially hindering transparency and financial accountability.",

        "section": "1.2 Standard of Service. (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an in-text contradiction regarding the Provider's ability to staff the Services. While 1.2(c) requires Provider to use its 'best efforts' to provide employees listed in Exhibit A and restricts changes without Recipient's consent, 1.2(e) allows Provider to use subcontractors. This creates ambiguity: Can Provider bypass the Representative restrictions in 1.2(c) by using subcontractors not listed in Exhibit A? If so, the restriction on changing Representatives is weakened. If not, the ability to use subcontractors is limited in an unclear way.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the agreement terminates on December 31, 2020, but Section 3.2 allows either party to terminate the agreement at any time with 90 days' written notice. This creates an in-text contradiction. If either party exercises their right to terminate under Section 3.2, the termination date could occur before or after December 31, 2020. The phrase 'unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.2' doesn't resolve the ambiguity, as it's unclear if Section 3.2 can extend the termination date or is solely meant to allow for earlier termination.",

        "section": "5.1 Indemnification. Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, \"Losses\"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient' broadens the scope of indemnification beyond typical third-party claims. Indemnifying Recipient against its own claims against Provider for Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of the agreement blurs the lines of responsibility and could lead to disputes over the nature and extent of indemnification. It's unusual to indemnify a party against their own direct claims, especially when those claims are based on the other party's wrongful conduct. This provision potentially allows the Recipient to be indemnified for losses resulting from the Provider's actions, even if those losses are due to direct claims by the Recipient against the Provider, creating an ambiguous situation regarding responsibility for damages.",

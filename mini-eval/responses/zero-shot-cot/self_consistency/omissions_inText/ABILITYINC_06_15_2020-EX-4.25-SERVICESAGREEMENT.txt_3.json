        "section": "1.2 (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a potential ambiguity. While it mandates that the initial Provider Representatives are listed in Exhibit A and that changes require Recipient's consent, it doesn't explicitly state what happens if a listed representative leaves the Provider's employment entirely.  Does Provider need consent to *not* replace that person? Is Provider obligated to replace the person? The clause focuses solely on 'changes', which is open to interpretation and can lead to disputes if a representative leaves the company.  There isn't clarity as to if the provider needs to find someone new with the same level of skill or experience.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a structural flaw.  The sentence is grammatically incorrect and doesn't read logically. It starts by saying \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement\" which does not make sense. It needs to be re-worded to clarify the intended meaning of the sentence.",

Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 3.1, all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.2 outlines the 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters.' It states how Provider will be paid, and includes 'Provider shall allow the Recipient to use [ * * * ] at no cost, until December 31, 2021.' Keeping this after termination may not make sense, as there may be nothing to do with the business relationship anymore and it is not clear what happens if the agreement terminates before the specified date in the provision.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the term and renewal process. It initially states the agreement is for one year from the Launch Date. However, it later states that if neither party gives notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed for another year. This creates a contradiction. The first statement implies active agreement is needed for renewal, while the second implies automatic renewal unless actively prevented.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the scope of indemnification. The phrase \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party\" is vague. It's unclear what legal standard or circumstances would cause one party to be deemed a principal of the other, especially given the explicitly stated independent contractor relationship in Section 12.5. This lack of clarity makes the indemnification obligation difficult to interpret and enforce.",

        "explanation": "The clause states that a party may immediately terminate the agreement for breach, however in subsection (a) it mentions that the other party has sixty (60) days to cure that breach. This creates contradiction as to how long a party has to terminate the agreement.",

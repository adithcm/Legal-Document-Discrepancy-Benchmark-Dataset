        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It initially states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term.' However, it then states that 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' This creates ambiguity as to whether the agreement requires a mutual written agreement or if it automatically renews if no notice is given.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content. In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Content and or the Services provided to Customers.",
        "explanation": "The initial sentence states indemnification arises from the Indemnifying Party's acts if the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. This limits the scope of the initial indemnity. However, the subsequent sentences broaden the indemnification obligations without reference to this principal-agent relationship. The second and third sentences create an inconsistency because they do not include the condition in the first sentence.",

        "section": "12.4 FORCE MAJEURE. Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that a party is excused from performance (other than payment) due to a force majeure event. The third sentence states that a force majeure event does not limit obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification). This creates an inconsistency because it is not clear whether a force majeure event would excuse a party from their indemnification obligations. If a force majeure event directly caused the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions, or misrepresentations, the conflict arises if the party is still obligated to indemnify the other party, even though their performance was excused due to the force majeure event.",

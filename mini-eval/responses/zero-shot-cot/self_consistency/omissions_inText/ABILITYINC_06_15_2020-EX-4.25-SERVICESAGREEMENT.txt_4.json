        "section": "1.2 Standard of Service. (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency. It states that the Provider shall use its best efforts to provide employees or contractors, and details of these representatives should be in Exhibit A. However, it also restricts the Provider from changing these representatives without the Recipient's consent and mandates their dedication solely to the Recipient. The contradiction arises because 'best efforts' implies some flexibility, while the restrictions on changes and dedication suggest a rigid requirement. If a listed representative becomes unavailable, the 'best efforts' clause is undermined by the inability to easily replace them.",

        "explanation": "The first line of Section 3.1 is grammatically incorrect and structurally flawed. It reads, 'This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020...' The repetition of 'Agreement' and the improper use of 'be deemed' make the sentence nonsensical. It lacks proper structure, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.",

Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 3.1, all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 3.5 states that upon termination of the agreement, Section 2.2 survives. However, Section 2.2 primarily deals with 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters,' including how invoices should be submitted and paid. It seems contradictory that payment terms would survive termination, potentially obligating the Recipient to pay for services after the agreement has ended, or conversely, obligating the provider to provide services that they will not be paid for.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section creates an in-text contradiction because it initially states that the CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, but then immediately provides an exception allowing the CONSULTANT to use other clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF. This contradicts the initial exclusivity clause. The 'but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter' doesn't negate the fact that he is still using a non ADAMS GOLF product.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section has an omission in text that results in an in-text contradiction. The contract states that CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events. However, the exact number is redacted. This means the reader does not know the exact requirements to fulfill the contract.",

        "section": "22. FAILURE TO PLAY Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.\n23. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the text because the repayment terms are different when CONSULTANT dies, is unable to play tour golf, or if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement. For failure to play or death, Adams Golf can terminate after 30 days written notice. For termination of cause, Adams Golf can terminate after 15 days written notice. Both scenarios require CONSULTANT to repay Adams Golf, but the written notice time period is different.",

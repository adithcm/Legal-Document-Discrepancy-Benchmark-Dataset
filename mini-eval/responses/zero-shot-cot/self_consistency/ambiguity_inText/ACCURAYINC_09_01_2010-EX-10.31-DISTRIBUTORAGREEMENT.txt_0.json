        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray. The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address: Accuray Incorporated ATTN: Contracts Administration 1310 Chesapeake Terrace Sunnyvale, CA 94089 Main: (408) 716-4600 Fax: (408) 789-4205 Email: Orders@accuray.com 2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 2.3.3 states that Accuray's failure to approve or disapprove a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, Section 2.3.4 allows the Distributor to cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not *executed* it within two weeks. Execution implies a higher level of commitment than mere approval. This creates a contradiction: Accuray could approve the Purchase Order, preventing it from being automatically disapproved under 2.3.3, but the Distributor could still cancel it if it's not fully executed within the same two-week period under 2.3.4. This ambiguity creates uncertainty about the validity and enforceability of the Purchase Order.",

        "section": "3.6. Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.\n\n4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "Section 3.6 mandates that the Distributor sends a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six months prior to the expected shipment date. Section 4.1.2 then discusses supplementary shipping costs. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order, Accuray bears the expedited delivery expenses. However, it is silent on the scenario where the purchase order is submitted *more* than six months prior to the shipment date. This omission creates ambiguity: if the purchase order is submitted, for example, nine months prior to the shipment date, but due to internal reasons, Accuray requires expedited delivery, it is not clear who should bear the supplementary shipping costs.",

        "section": "4.6. Warranty. 4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor 8 shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. 4.6.2. Hardware and Software. If a Customer notifies Accuray in writing during the Warranty Period of a defect in a Product that causes the Product to fail to conform to the foregoing warranty, Accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non- conforming Product or, if in Accuray's opinion such repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable, Accuray shall refund a pro-rated portion of the price paid by the Customer for such Product calculated based on a straight-line depreciation over a 5-year period beginning on the date of delivery. This will be Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and such Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective Products and parts.",
        "explanation": "In Section 4.6.1, the warranty period is defined as one year following installation, but not to exceed 18 months following shipment. Section 4.6.2 then states the remedy if a defect occurs during the \"Warranty Period\". The contradiction arises because if installation is delayed significantly (e.g., 17 months after shipment), the practical warranty period after installation could be as short as one month, or even zero if installation occurs after 18 months. This severely limits the customer's remedy and contradicts the implied intent of providing a one-year warranty. The customer effectively loses warranty coverage due to delays outside of their control.",

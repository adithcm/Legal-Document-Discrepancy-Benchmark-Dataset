        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the scope of services the Provider is obligated to provide. While it states the Provider agrees to provide services outlined in Exhibit A, it also introduces a condition that Provider is not obligated to respond to requests for 'additional' services not contemplated in the Exhibit unless it deems it 'fit and feasible'. The terms 'additional services', 'fit' and 'feasible' are vague. This gives the Provider significant discretion to refuse services the Recipient might reasonably expect, creating an internal contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section stipulates that the Provider Representatives must be dedicated solely to providing services to the Recipient. However, section 1.1(a) states that provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible. This is a contradiction because the representatives can also be working for the provider if the provider deems it fit and feasible to not complete the obligations in exhibit A. This can also mean that the provider representative is working for another company if the Provider deems it fit and feasible.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the agreement terminates on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier according to Section 3.2. Section 3.2 then says, \"Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause, and without liability except, in the case of the Recipient, for required payment for services rendered and reimbursement for authorized expenses incurred, by providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the 'Services Termination Date').\" This section is confusing, because it is not clear what the point of 3.1 is if 3.2 allows either party to terminate the agreement at anytime. 3.1 says the agreement shall terminate on December 31, 2020, but 3.2 says the agreement can terminate at anytime. The point of 3.1 is redundant and is not needed.",

        "explanation": "This section allocates responsibility for employees of the Provider. However, it does not explicitly address the situation if the Recipient directly manages or controls the Provider's employees in a way that could be construed as creating a de facto employer-employee relationship. This omission is a discrepancy because, under labor laws, 'economic realities' can dictate employment status regardless of contractual language. If the Recipient exercises significant control, it could be deemed a co-employer and become liable for employment-related obligations, contradicting the stated intention that Provider remains solely responsible.",

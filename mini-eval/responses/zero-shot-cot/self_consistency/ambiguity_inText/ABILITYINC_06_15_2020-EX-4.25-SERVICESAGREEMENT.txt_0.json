(a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the Provider's obligation to provide services. While it states that the Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth in Exhibit A, it also includes a clause that the Provider is not obligated to respond to requests for additional services not currently contemplated in the Exhibit unless they deem it fit and feasible. This contradicts the initial agreement to provide services as it provides an easy opt-out for the provider.",

        "explanation": "This section allows for termination without cause with 90 days' notice, but then creates ambiguity about payment. The phrase \"except, in the case of the Recipient, for required payment for services rendered and reimbursement for authorized expenses incurred\" is vague. If the agreement is terminated, will Recipient still be liable for 90 days of services, or only services rendered up to the termination date? This section is unclear.",

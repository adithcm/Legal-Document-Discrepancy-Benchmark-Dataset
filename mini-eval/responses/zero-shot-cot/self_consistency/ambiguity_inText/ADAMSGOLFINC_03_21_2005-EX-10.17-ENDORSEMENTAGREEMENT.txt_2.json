        "section": "MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION\n A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within one month following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than January 31, 2006.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the minimum number of tournaments the Consultant must participate in and the repayment schedule if the minimum is not met. The discrepancy lies in the use of redacted information (denoted by '[*****]') for critical details such as the minimum number of events and the repayment amounts. This omission makes it impossible to determine the consultant's exact obligations and the financial consequences of not meeting those obligations. It creates a situation where the parties could have different interpretations of the agreement, leading to disputes.",

        "section": "FAILURE TO PLAY\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination due to the Consultant's inability to play and mandates repayment to ADAMS GOLF. The contradiction arises because the repayment amount is calculated based on paragraph 8A. Paragraph 8A discusses the terms of repayment if the consultant does not play the minimum amount of games required. This section is discussing the consultatnt not being able to play at all. While related, the paragraph discusses playing less than a certain number, not 0 games. Applying the formula could be seen as unfair because the circumstances of not palying at all and playing less than an ammount have different circumstances.",

        "section": "TERMINATION FOR CAUSE\nNotwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, if either party commits any material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause upon giving fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such fifteen (15) day period. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section is similar to section 22, where there is a mention of repayment using the formula in section 8A. Section 8A does not apply to this scenario because it discusses the circumstances of not playing the minimum number of games, not the circumstance where the contract is terminated for any other cause. This is not logical and could lead to a dispute about the amount that has to be paid.",

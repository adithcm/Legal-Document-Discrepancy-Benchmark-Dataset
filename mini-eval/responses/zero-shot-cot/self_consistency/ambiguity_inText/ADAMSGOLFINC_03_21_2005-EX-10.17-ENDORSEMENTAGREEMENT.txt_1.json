The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to carve out an exception to the exclusivity clause (Section 4A, 4B, 4C) allowing the consultant to endorse another product ([*****]). However, the extensive redactions ([*****]) throughout this paragraph render the scope and limitations of this exception extremely ambiguous. The redacted material obscures the specific product that can be endorsed, the permitted uses of the consultant's name/likeness in connection with that product, and the parameters of \"past practice.\" This makes it nearly impossible to determine the extent to which the consultant can endorse the other product without violating the exclusivity provisions regarding ADAMS GOLF's PRODUCT. This lack of clarity creates a significant potential for disputes regarding the consultant's endorsement activities.",

        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows: The agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year: 1. Year 1. $[*****] 2. Year 2 $[*****] 3. Year 3 $[*****] 4. Year 4 $[*****] 5. Year 5 $[*****]",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"satisfactory record of play\" is vague and undefined. There are no objective criteria provided to determine what constitutes a \"satisfactory record of play\". This ambiguity makes the requirement to play a minimum number of events and the corresponding repayment clause difficult to enforce. The extensive redactions of the number of events and the repayment amounts exacerbate the issue, obscuring the economic implications of this clause and increasing the likelihood of disputes over performance and repayment obligations.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section details the consequences of the consultant's death or inability to play golf. It specifies that Adams Golf can terminate the agreement and that the consultant's estate must repay Adams Golf for the unperformed portion of the agreement. The repayment amount is to be calculated according to paragraph 8A. However, Section 8A outlines a repayment schedule that is tied to the number of tournaments the consultant *doesn't* play, not a general pro-rata repayment for the entire unfulfilled contract period. Applying the 8A repayment structure in the event of death or permanent disability doesn't make logical sense. 8A focuses on a tournament reduction within a year, and isn't designed to account for a total contract failure.",

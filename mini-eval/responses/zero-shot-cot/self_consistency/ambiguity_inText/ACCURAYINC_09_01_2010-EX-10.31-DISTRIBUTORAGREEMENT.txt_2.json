        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "Accuray's failure to respond to the purchase order within two weeks automatically constitutes disapproval. This could lead to confusion or disputes if Accuray intended to approve but simply missed the deadline. A lack of explicit communication, even if implied, is not the best business practice and could lead to loss of business for both parties.",

        "explanation": "Section 3.6 mandates that the Distributor submit a Purchase Order at least six months before the anticipated shipment date. However, Section 4.1.2 states that if a Purchase Order is submitted six months before the requested delivery date and Accuray has issues with delivering within that time frame, Accuray will expedite the delivery at their expense. This suggests Accuray's standard lead time is less than six months, creating an internal contradiction. If the standard lead time is indeed six months as stated in section 2.4, it would not make sense that Accuray would cover expedited delivery costs.",

        "explanation": "The warranty period is defined as one year after installation but no more than 18 months after shipment. This creates a situation where if installation is delayed beyond six months after shipment, the customer receives less than a year of warranty coverage. This could be seen as a misrepresentation of the warranty's duration and potential conflict.",

        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "This definition is ambiguous because it is not clear how a 'Third Party' is granted distribution rights by Siemens. If Siemens grants these rights, does that third party become an affiliate? The relationship and conditions under which Siemens can grant these rights need to be clarified. Furthermore, the scope of the distribution rights granted to the third party needs to be defined.",

        "section": "2.3.2. Quote. Following receipt of Distributor's Quote request, Accuray will determine whether to approve the issuance of a Quote related to such request. Such determination shall be made in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Schedule 2.3.2 attached hereto. If Accuray approves the issuance of a Quote, Accuray shall issue a Quote to Distributor based on the Product configuration and Services requested by the Customer, including pricing for such Products and Services as provided in Section 2.2 above. The Quote issued by Accuray in relation to a Customer opportunity shall serve as the basis of any offer made by Distributor to that Customer and shall remain valid for at least six months (unless earlier declined by Distributor), and Distributor shall submit an amended Quote request to Accuray in the event adjustments to a Quote are requested by the Customer. Any such amended Quote request from Distributor shall again be subject to the Accuray approval process set forth in this Section 2.3.2.",
        "explanation": "There is an ambiguity of text because a quote is valid for at least 6 months, which means the quote can be valid for longer than 6 months. This also introduces some confusion since the terminology is not aligned in the text as to the definition of 'at least'.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency in text regarding who bears the expedited delivery costs. It states Accuray bears the cost if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the example then states that if the Purchase Order was submitted on June 1 with a delivery date of December 1, Accuray pays, but if the delivery date is October 1, the Distributor pays. This creates conflicting deadlines and obligations.",

        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. However, Provider is not obligated to respond to any request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, unless Provider deems it fit and feasible.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity. While the Provider agrees to provide services outlined in Exhibit A, it also states that the Provider is not obligated to provide additional services, even if necessary for the Recipient's operation, unless the Provider deems it 'fit and feasible'. This undermines the initial agreement to provide services and introduces uncertainty about the scope of the Provider's responsibility.",

        "explanation": "This section describes that the Recipient owns all rights to any intellectual property made by the Provider, but only 'if both parties agree it is related to the services'. The phrase 'if both parties agree' introduces an element of subjectivity and potential dispute. It is unclear how this agreement would be documented or what happens if the parties disagree. The wording could allow the Provider to retain rights to intellectual property created while performing the Services, which contradicts the general intent of assigning ownership to the Recipient.",

        "section": "D.Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and potential contradiction regarding the extent of CONSULTANT's endorsement rights for products other than ADAMS GOLF's. While it allows endorsement of [*****], the conditions are vaguely defined, referencing past advertising practices of 'similarly situated professionals'. This introduces subjectivity. The statement 'CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]' if the endorsement deviates from past practice is also vague. What constitutes 'action' and what is considered a sufficient remedy are not specified, which could lead to disputes. Furthermore, the limitations on placing a [*****] logo on ADAMS GOLF products creates a contradictory restriction within the permission to endorse a competing product.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the termination of agreement and the repayment that CONSULTANT's estate will need to provide to ADAMS GOLF. Logically, in the event of death or inability to play, the CONSULTANT is no longer able to continue the agreement and therefore, CONSULTANT or CONSULTANT's estate will need to pay ADAMS GOLF for the remaining time left on the contract. But the contradiction is that paragraph 8A is about 'MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION', which is very specific and about minimum tournaments played in a year, which will not apply in this instance. This is an example of not aligning the correct repayment method.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination for cause due to a material breach of the agreement by either party. Upon termination, CONSULTANT is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period, calculated according to paragraph 8A. The potential contradiction arises because paragraph 8A deals specifically with repayment related to a minimum number of tournaments played by the CONSULTANT. If the agreement is terminated for a different 'material breach' (e.g., ADAMS GOLF fails to make timely payments), it's illogical and potentially unfair to calculate CONSULTANT's repayment based on a formula tied to tournament participation. There is no clear link to how paragraph 8A works with this Section.",

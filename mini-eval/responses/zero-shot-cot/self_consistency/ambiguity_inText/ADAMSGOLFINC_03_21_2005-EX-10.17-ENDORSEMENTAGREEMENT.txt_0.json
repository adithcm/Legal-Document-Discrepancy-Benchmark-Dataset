The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding the scope of the Consultant's endorsement of [*****]. While paragraphs 4A, 4B, and 4C restrict the Consultant from endorsing competing products, this section allows endorsement of [*****] under certain conditions. However, these conditions are vague and rely on undefined terms like \"past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals,\" making it unclear what constitutes permissible endorsement activities. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether the Consultant's endorsement activities for [*****] violate the exclusivity provisions outlined in paragraphs 4A, 4B, and 4C. The section further states that if the consultant's relationship with [*****] terminates then the consultant is permitted to replace the endorsement with another endorsement under the 'same terms and conditions expressed herein'. But it does not clearly outline what 'terms and conditions' this means.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines the minimum number of tournaments the Consultant must participate in and the repayment schedule if the minimum is not met. However, the definition of \"satisfactory record of play\" is missing. Without a clear definition, it's open to interpretation and could lead to disputes.

The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the consequences of the Consultant's inability to play tour golf or death, including termination of the agreement and repayment of compensation. However, it states that the repayment amount is calculated in the 'same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A'. There is a contradiction because paragraph 8A is the 'MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION'. Therefore, the circumstances are different. The calculation under section 8A will not make sense under section 22.",

        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "This definition is ambiguous because it doesn't clarify the relationship and responsibilities between Siemens, its Affiliates, and any Third Party distributors. Specifically, it's unclear whether Siemens retains ultimate responsibility for the actions of its Affiliates and Third-Party distributors under this agreement. The term 'whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens' is vague and open to interpretation, potentially leading to disputes about liability and fulfillment of contractual obligations.",

        "section": "2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an in-text contradiction. The first sentence allows the Distributor to cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray doesn't execute it within two weeks. However, the third sentence states that in case of inconsistency between the Quote/Purchase order and the Agreement, the Agreement prevails UNLESS the Quote/Purchase Order is signed by specific high-level executives AND explicitly states its intent to supersede the Agreement. This implies that a Purchase Order CAN supersede the Agreement under specific circumstances, even though the distributor can cancel if it isn't executed in 2 weeks. The contradiction arises because the cancellation clause and the superseding clause are not mutually exclusive. A Purchase Order could potentially be in a state of limbo - not executed by Accuray in the time frame to avoid cancellation, yet arguably still valid due to the high-level executive signatures.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency in text regarding who bears the cost of expedited shipping. It states that Accuray will bear supplementary shipping costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order. However, it also uses an example where it mentions that if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray. The problem is that 'at least six months' is not properly defined or interpreted in both scenarios. In one interpretation, the requested delivery date has to be exactly six months after the submission, and in the other, the delivery date can be more than six months after the submission.",

        "section": "18. BASE COMPENSATION For the entire term of this Agreement, from September 1, 2004 through [*****] ADAMS GOLF *intends* to pay CONSULTANT a base compensation of [*****] dollars. Payment of the base compensation will be subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value.",
        "explanation": "The use of the word \"intends\" weakens the obligation of ADAMS GOLF to pay the base compensation. Furthermore, making the payment of the base compensation \"subject to ADAMS GOLF's financial performance and continued evaluation of CONSULTANT's brand value\" introduces significant ambiguity. These conditions could allow ADAMS GOLF to avoid paying the base compensation even if CONSULTANT fulfills all his obligations under the agreement, creating a considerable risk for the consultant. The lack of clear, objective criteria for evaluating financial performance and brand value opens the door for subjective interpretation and potential disputes.",

(It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "Section 5 establishes that CONSULTANT must exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, however, a caveat is immediately introduced allowing CONSULTANT to play other clubs besides ADAMS GOLF clubs. This creates an ambiguity in how strictly exclusive is defined. The terminology is misaligned between stating exclusive use and then immediately permitting non-Adams Golf products in the bag.",

FAILURE TO PLAY Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "It is contradictory to expect the CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT if they die or are unable to play tour golf at all. It is not appropriate to have someone who dies to repay the company, since that is out of their control. This is an example of inconsistencies in text.",

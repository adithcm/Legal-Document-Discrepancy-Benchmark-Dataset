        "section": "3.2 Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause. However, termination by either party is subject to a termination fee of [ * * * ], and liability may arise based on a review of outstanding commitments. To do so, providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\").",
        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency. The first sentence states that either party can terminate the agreement 'at any time without cause,' suggesting immediate termination is possible, but it later requires providing 90 days' prior written notice. This contradicts the 'at any time' clause, as a 90-day notice period inherently delays the termination. Furthermore, the need of a 'termination fee' alongside a review of outstanding commitments goes against the claim that it can be terminated 'without cause.'",

(d) Notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt.",
        "explanation": "This section regarding notices presents an internal inconsistency. Subsection (c) states that email or fax communications are only considered valid if the recipient confirms receipt within 72 hours, implying that without confirmation, they are deemed not received. However, subsection (d) states that notices sent via mail are deemed received upon dispatch, regardless of actual delivery or return receipt. This creates an inconsistent standard for different methods of communication, as mail is considered delivered even without confirmation, while email and fax require confirmation. This inconsistency can lead to disputes over whether a notice was effectively given, especially if an email or fax is sent but receipt is not confirmed within the specified timeframe.",

        "section": "3.6. Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "Section 3.6 mentions 'as determined pursuant to Section 4.8' regarding the Service Agreement. However, Section 4.8 outlines the conditions under which Accuray will execute a Service Agreement, primarily focusing on receipt of a customer-executed agreement and payments. It doesn't actually determine whether the service agreement is between Accuray and the customer or Accuray and the distributor, leading to ambiguity.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency related to who bears the expedited shipping costs. It states that Accuray bears the costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission. However, the section also includes an example where a Purchase Order submitted on June 1 with a requested delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months later) has the expedited delivery costs borne by Accuray. The ambiguity arises because the phrase \"at least six months\" is open to interpretation - does six months exactly qualify?",

        "section": "5.4.1. System Purchase Payments. Payment for the purchase of a System shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars in the form of either (1) an irrevocable trade finance letter of credit or (2) wire transfer as further described in Sections 5.4.1.1 (Letter of Credit) and 5.4.1.2 (Wire Transfer), respectively below. Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence adds a condition for when a payment is considered past due, specifically referencing  14 of the German Civil Code (BGB) and the concept of a 'business person.' This introduces a structural flaw because a definition from German law is applied within a contract that, according to Section 12.1, is governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany but excluding the provisions of German private international law, which would typically govern the application of foreign law concepts. This inconsistent application of German law makes the provision structurally unsound.",

        "explanation": "Section 3.1 states that the agreement will terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier according to Section 3.2. However, Section 3.2 allows either party to terminate the agreement at any time without cause, provided they give 90 days' prior written notice. This creates an inconsistency. The agreement has a defined end date (December 31, 2020) but also allows for termination at any point with 90 days' notice, which could extend the agreement beyond the stated termination date if notice is given before but the 90 days extends past the original termination date.",

Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 3.1, all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "Section 3.5 states that upon termination pursuant to Section 3.1, Section 2.2, 4, 5, and 6 survive the termination. Section 2.2 outlines 'Terms of Payment and Related Matters'. However, Section 3.6 outlines responsibilities 'upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason'. The inclusion of 'upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason' suggests that Section 3.6 should apply no matter what the reason for termination, and that the parties have a responsibility to follow through with that section. Since there are two termination sections, this makes the contract confusing and hard to understand.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section allows the consultant to endorse another product, which seems to contradict the exclusivity clause established in sections 4A, 4B, and 4C. The conditions under which this endorsement is allowed are vague and undefined due to redactions, making it difficult to determine the scope and limitations of this exception. The text is unclear regarding what constitutes a variation from past advertising practice and what actions CONSULTANT is expected to take to remedy the situation. The paragraph lacks clear standards for determining the consistency of the endorsement with past practices.",

        "section": "It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the MANDATORY PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated. Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an in-text contradiction related to the remedy if the Mandatory Product is unsuitable. The agreement allows ADAMS GOLF to either supply suitable product or terminate the agreement. However, if ADAMS GOLF chooses to terminate the agreement, the compensation is prorated. It is unclear if the proration is in favor of the CONSULTANT, or in favor of ADAMS GOLF. It needs to be clear whether Adams Golf owes consultant money, or whether the consultant owes Adams Golf money.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section dictates the repayment obligations of the CONSULTANT or their estate if the agreement is terminated due to death or inability to play golf. The contradiction lies in the implication that the CONSULTANT or their estate would be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for services not performed in a situation where performance is impossible due to death or disability. It would make logical sense that the estate would not owe Adams Golf any money in the event of the consultants death.",

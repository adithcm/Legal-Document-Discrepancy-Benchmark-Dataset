        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity because it allows Watson to endorse a competing product ([*****]). The agreement states that Watson will wear Adams Golf apparel during sponsored events and cannot put the competing brands logo on Adams Golf equipment. However, the terms regarding Watson's obligations to Adams Golf when endorsing the competing brand are vague. Without explicit parameters, it is open to interpretation what constitutes acceptable behavior and if he is breaching the contract agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section presents an omission in legal terms regarding the scope of indemnification. A typical indemnity clause would include protection against third-party claims. The clause does not explicitly state whether the indemnity extends to claims made by third parties against Adams Golf due to Watson's actions or omissions. This omission potentially exposes Adams Golf to uncovered liabilities. It's unclear if the Consultant is only responsible for direct breaches of the agreement, or also for liabilities arising from third-party claims related to his endorsement.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an inconsistency because it requires the consultant's estate to repay Adams Golf in the event of death. This is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of contract law which do not allow for the enforcement of obligations against a deceased party's estate in such a manner, especially considering the nature of the agreement which relies on the consultant's personal services. It is ambiguous and potentially unconscionable to demand repayment for services that cannot be performed due to death.",

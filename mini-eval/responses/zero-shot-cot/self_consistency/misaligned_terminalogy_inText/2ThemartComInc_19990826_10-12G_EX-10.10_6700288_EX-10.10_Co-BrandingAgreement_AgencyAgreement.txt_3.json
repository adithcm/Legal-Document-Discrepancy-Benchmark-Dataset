        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the term and renewal process of the agreement. The language is contradictory because it first states the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement of both parties, which makes sense, but then goes on to say that in the event either party does not give such notice (of non-renewal) then the agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year. This suggests that if neither party takes action, the agreement is automatically renewed which contradicts the initial requirement for mutual written agreement.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence of this section states that the Guarantor will protect the Protected Party, but only if the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. The subsequent sentences extend indemnity from 2TheMart to i-Escrow and from i-Escrow to 2TheMart without mentioning the key agent contingency. This is an in-text contradiction because the initial condition set for the general indemnity is not applied consistently to the specific indemnity obligations outlined later in the same section.",

        "section": "12.4 FORCE MAJEURE. Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This section describes force majeure and its effects. There is a contradiction in the last sentence. The section provides that if a force majeure event occurs then it shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9. Section 9 is the Indemnity section. This means that even if a force majeure event occurs, the parties are still responsible for their indemnity obligations. This contradicts the general principle of force majeure, which is to excuse performance when events beyond a party's control occur. Indemnity obligations are often tied to the performance or non-performance of the agreement; thus it would be logical that force majeure could affect such obligations.",

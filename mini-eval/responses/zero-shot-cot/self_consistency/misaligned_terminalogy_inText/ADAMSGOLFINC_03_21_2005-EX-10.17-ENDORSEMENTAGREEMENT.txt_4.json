        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall not be required to wear ADAMS GOLF [*****] in [*****] ads.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction with the earlier exclusivity clauses (4A, 4B, 4C). While those paragraphs generally prevent Watson from endorsing competitors, this allows him to not wear Adams Golf apparel in [*****] ads, implying he *could* wear a competitor's apparel. This weakens the exclusivity granted to Adams Golf and could be interpreted as an endorsement of a competing product, depending on what Watson chooses to wear (or not wear) in those ads. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the extent of the exclusivity granted to Adams Golf.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This creates a potential ambiguity in legal terms. While the clause allows termination if the consultant dies or is unable to play, it also states that the consultant or their estate would need to repay ADAMS GOLF. This could create legal and ethical issues, as the consultant would be unable to perform due to death or inability to play tour golf. This creates an ambiguity and may not be enforceable under certain state and national laws.",

        "section": "CONSULTANT warrants and represents that during the term of this Agreement he is a member in good standing of SAG, AFTRA or any other organization having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT'S services hereunder. This Agreement is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreements with SAG, AFTRA, or any other union agreements or codes having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT'S services hereunder. Any and all payments required to be made to SAG or AFTRA or any other organization having jurisdiction over CONSULTANT'S services hereunder, shall be the sole responsibility of CONSULTANT.",
        "explanation": "This introduces a structural flaw in the legal terms. SAG and AFTRA primarily represent actors, performers, and media professionals. It is unusual and potentially nonsensical for a professional golfer's endorsement agreement to be explicitly subject to SAG/AFTRA agreements unless the endorsement involves acting or performance-related services covered by those unions. This makes the section structurally flawed as it attempts to apply unrelated union regulations to a sports endorsement contract, without clear justification.",

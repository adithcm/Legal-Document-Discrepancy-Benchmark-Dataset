        "section": "The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Participant shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Investor shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "The terms \"Joint Venturers\" and \"Participant\"/\"Investor\" are used interchangeably, but it is not clearly defined if they all refer to the same entity. This could lead to confusion, especially if a dispute arises over which obligations apply to which entity. Although in the first sentence they use the term \"Joint Venturers\", they never use this term for the second sentence. The terms \"Participant\" and \"Investor\" were never used prior to this section.",

If requested by a Stockholder, the Joint Venture books and records shall be audited as of the close of each year by an independent accountant acceptable to both Joint Venturers.",
        "explanation": "The term \"Stockholder\" is used without being defined. The Joint Venture is formed by Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. and Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc., which are referred to as Joint Venturers. It is unclear if \"Stockholder\" refers to the Joint Venturers themselves, or some other entity. This creates potential ambiguity regarding who can request an audit of the Joint Venture's books and records, leading to a contradiction in enforcing financial oversight.",

        "explanation": "The termination date is February 28, 2004, and the extension requires a written agreement not less than 30 days prior to termination. This means the latest date for extension is January 29, 2004 (29 days before February 28). However, February has 28 days, so 30 days prior to February 28 would be January 29. There is no exact 30 day mark.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "Accuray's failure to respond to the purchase order within two weeks results in a disapproval, there is no approval mentioned to when it comes to the distributor. This is a misalignment because the distributor needs to know when the purchase order is approved.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency in responsibility for expedited shipping costs. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the Purchase Order submission, Accuray bears the expedited costs. However, it then provides an example where a Purchase Order submitted on June 1 with a delivery date of December 1 (exactly six months later) has the expedited costs borne by Accuray, while a delivery date of October 1 (less than six months) has the costs borne by the Distributor. The inconsistency lies in whether 'at least six months' includes exactly six months or more than six months.",

        "section": "5.4.1. System Purchase Payments. Payment for the purchase of a System shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars in the form of either (1) an irrevocable trade finance letter of credit or (2) wire transfer as further described in Sections 5.4.1.1 (Letter of Credit) and 5.4.1.2 (Wire Transfer), respectively below. Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in  14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a condition for when payment is considered past due specifically for distributors defined as 'business persons' under German law. It states that payment is only past due if the Distributor fails to pay after receiving a payment demand note. This implies that even if the payment deadline is missed, interest will not accrue until after a demand note is issued and remains unpaid. This is an ambiguity in text because it provides different parameters for a distributor to pay their balance and does not specify when the interests are applied.",

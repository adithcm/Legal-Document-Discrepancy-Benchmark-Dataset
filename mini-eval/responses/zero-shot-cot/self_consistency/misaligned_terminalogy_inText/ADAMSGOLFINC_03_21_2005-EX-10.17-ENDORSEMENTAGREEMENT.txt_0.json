        "section": "A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "This section establishes a minimum number of tournaments the Consultant must participate in annually and a repayment schedule if that minimum isn't met. The redacted number of events makes it impossible to determine the Consultant's exact obligation or calculate the repayment amount accurately. This creates ambiguity in the enforceability of this clause.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the consequences of termination due to the consultant's death or inability to play, stating that the consultant or their estate must repay Adams Golf for the unperformed period. The reference to calculating the repayment amount as per paragraph 8A is problematic because paragraph 8A relies on a redacted number, meaning the repayment calculation is not clearly defined and therefore unenforceable. Because of this, the calculation of repayment becomes ambigious.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses termination for cause and includes a clause requiring the Consultant to repay Adams Golf for the unperformed period, calculated according to paragraph 8A. Since 8A is dependent on redacted information, as explained above, this creates a contradiction because the repayment calculation is not clearly defined. This also leads to an in-text contradiction.",

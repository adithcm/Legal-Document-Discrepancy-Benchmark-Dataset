        "explanation": "The Recitals section A defines Deliverables as certain services and resources to be provided by the Vendor, while the rest of the document consistently refers to the Provider as the entity providing services. This creates a misalignment because it introduces the term 'Vendor' without clearly establishing its relationship to 'Provider', potentially leading to confusion about which entity is responsible for the Deliverables and services. This can cause an in-text contradiction as the agreement becomes unclear on who is providing the services.",

        "explanation": "Section 3.1 states that the agreement will terminate on December 31, 2020, unless terminated earlier according to Section 3.2. Section 3.2 allows either the Recipient or the Provider to terminate the agreement at any time without cause, with 90 days' prior written notice. This creates a contradiction because the agreement could be terminated before December 31, 2020, but Section 3.1 makes it seem as though the agreement will last until this date no matter what. ",

        "section": "5.  Indemnification. 5.1 Indemnification. Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, \"Losses\"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "The wording in Section 5.1 is ambiguous. It states that the Provider shall indemnify the Recipient against losses arising out of claims of a third party or the Recipient. It is unusual and potentially problematic for an indemnification clause to include claims made by the Indemnified Party (Recipient) against the Indemnifying Party (Provider). Indemnification is typically meant to cover claims from third parties, not direct claims between the parties to the agreement. This creates an ambiguity in the text and can be categorized as structural flaw.",

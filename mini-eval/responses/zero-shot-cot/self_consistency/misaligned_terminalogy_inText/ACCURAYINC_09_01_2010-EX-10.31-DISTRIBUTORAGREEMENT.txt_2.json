        "section": "5.4.1.1. Letter of Credit. An irrevocable trade finance letter of credit issued by Distributor's bank, confirmed by a bank designated by Accuray in all respects and delivered to Accuray upon the acceptance of the Purchase Order by Accuray. The letter of credit will provide that Accuray can draw against the letter of credit according to the following schedule: 5.4.1.1.1. US $100,000 (non-refundable but, in case of cancellation of the Purchase Order, automatically applied to Distributor's next purchase of a System) upon Accuray's acceptance of the Purchase Order, which must be at least four (4) months prior to the Distributor's proposed shipment date; and 5.4.1.1.2. Balance upon presentation of documents by Accuray evidencing shipment of the Products to Distributor or Customer as designated in the Purchase Order.",
        "explanation": "The condition that the initial payment of US $100,000 is non-refundable but automatically applied to the distributor's next purchase creates a structural flaw in the payment terms. If the distributor chooses not to make another purchase, the funds are effectively forfeited, creating an unclear scenario for the handling of these funds, which may violate accounting principles.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency in text regarding who bears the cost of expedited shipping. It states that if the delivery deadline is at least six months after the submission of the Purchase Order, Accuray bears the cost. However, if the requested delivery date is less than six months, the distributor bears the cost. The phrase 'at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor' is too vague, leading to multiple interpretations and confusion regarding the payment of shipping.",

        "section": "5.5. Collections. Notwithstanding Section 5.4.3 above, Distributor shall be solely responsible for determining the creditworthiness of and collecting payment from its Customers. The risk of non-collection from the Customer will be borne entirely by Distributor, which shall be responsible for making timely payment to Accuray for Products whether or not Distributor is successful in collecting from its Customer. In the event that full payment is not received by Accuray, Accuray shall not be liable to Distributor for any margin or commission unless and until it has received payment of amounts sufficient to cover the costs incurred by Accuray to provide the applicable Products to Distributor and the applicable Services to Customer (\"Accuray Cost\"). Distributor acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled to receive payment of any margin or commission until Accuray has received payment of the Accuray Cost amount in relation to the applicable Products and Services.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an ambiguity in text regarding payment responsibilities. It starts by stating the distributor is responsible for payment regardless of customer collection, but later implies that the distributor's margin or commission is contingent on Accuray receiving full payment from the customer. This is contradictory and creates confusion about the distributor's financial risk.",

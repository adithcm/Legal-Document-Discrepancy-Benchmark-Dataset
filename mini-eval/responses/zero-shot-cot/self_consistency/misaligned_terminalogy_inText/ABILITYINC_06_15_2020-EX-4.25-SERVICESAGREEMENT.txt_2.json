        "explanation": "The Recitals section introduces both 'Deliverables' and 'Services' but uses 'Vendor' instead of 'Provider' which is how the Provider is defined at the begining of the agreement. This creates confusion because the services agreement is between the Recipient and Provider but it indicates that the Recipient wishes to engage the Vendor, which has not been defined. This could lead to confusion or disputes over which entity is actually responsible for providing the services.",

        "explanation": "There appears to be a typo or grammatical error in Section 3.1. It states \"This Agreement be deemed effective as of the Effective Date, Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2020...\" The sentence is awkwardly worded and contains a redundant use of the word \"Agreement.\" This error affects the structural integrity of the sentence and makes it harder to read. The way the sentence is constructed does not make sense.",

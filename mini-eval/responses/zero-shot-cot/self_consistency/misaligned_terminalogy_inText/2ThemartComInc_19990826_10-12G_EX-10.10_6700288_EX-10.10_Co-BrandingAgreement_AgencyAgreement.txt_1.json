        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It initially states that renewal requires mutual written agreement, but then it states that the agreement is automatically renewed if notice is not given. This creates confusion as to the actual renewal process.",

        "section": "9. INDEMNITY. Each party (the \"Guarantor\") shall protect the other party (the \"Protected Party\") from any and all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, specifically including legal counsel payments, that the Protected Party accrues due to external grievances resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, provided the Protected Party is considered a key agent of the Guarantor. Furthermore, 2TheMart will protect i-Escrow from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, inclusive of justifiable legal costs, that i-Escrow bears due to external grievances derived from 2TheMart Material. Additionally, i-Escrow will protect 2TheMart from all liabilities, damages, charges, and expenditures, including justified attorney costs, that 2TheMart bears due to external grievances arising from i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence includes a condition that the Protected Party is considered a 'key agent of the Guarantor.' However, the following sentences regarding specific indemnification obligations for 2TheMart and i-Escrow do not include this condition. This creates ambiguity and potential contradiction as to whether the 'key agent' condition applies to all indemnification obligations within this section or only the general statement in the first sentence.",

        "section": "5.1 ADVERTISING FEES. After the Launch Date, i-Escrow shall pay 2TheMart advertising fees based on the volume of Customer Engagements. This advertising remuneration will equal a rate per Customer Engagement that is determined by multiplying 0.025% by the median revenue per Customer from the prior fiscal period. This rate may be updated periodically during the duration of the contract following market analysis and with written consent from both parties (\"the Revised Pricing\"). The Revised Pricing will be attached as an exhibit to this contract.",
        "explanation": "The method for determining the advertising fee is unclear. It states that the rate is 0.025% multiplied by the median revenue per customer from the prior fiscal period, but it does not define what a 'customer engagement' is. This lack of definition makes it difficult to calculate the advertising fees accurately.",

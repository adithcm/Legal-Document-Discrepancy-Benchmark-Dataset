        "section": "Distributor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to introduce, promote the sale of, and obtain orders for the Products and Services in connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, including, without limitation, including the Products and Services in each of Distributor's 4 Oncology Care Systems price book and sales operation system, such that all of Distributor's sales representatives can access quotations for Products and Services at least as easily as all other systems then available for purchase from Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The sentence is awkwardly constructed and includes a non-essential clause, creating structural flaws. The clause 'including, without limitation, including the Products and Services in each of Distributor's 4 Oncology Care Systems price book and sales operation system' is repeated within itself. The phrase 'including, without limitation,' is used to introduce examples, but the example provided is simply a re-statement of what's already being included, which creates redundancy and adds to structural issues.",

        "section": "For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This section presents two different agreements regarding the parties involved in the contract. First, it is between Distributor and the Customer. Then, it could be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor. It is not clearly defined what makes the service agreement be between Accuray and the Customer, or Accuray and the distributor. The lack of clarity regarding under what circumstances the Service Agreement is between Accuray and the Customer versus Accuray and the Distributor creates potential for dispute and misinterpretation. This ambiguity can lead to disagreements about which entity is responsible for fulfilling the service obligations. This ambiguity in text is an in-text contradiction.",

Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the conditions under which Accuray will defend, indemnify, and hold Distributor harmless from third-party claims related to product safety, it also contradicts itself by stating that Accuray will have sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent. This contradicts itself as Accuray has sole control of the defense but also states Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent, which means the distributor has some say.",

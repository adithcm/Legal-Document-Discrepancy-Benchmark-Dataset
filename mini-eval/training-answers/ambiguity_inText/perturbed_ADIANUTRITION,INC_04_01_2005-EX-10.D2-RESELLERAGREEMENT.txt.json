                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for six (6) months.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for six (6) months, unless otherwise terminated as per Section 5.2. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this agreement is automatically renewed for subsequent one-year periods, unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed six-month term. The modified text introduces an automatic renewal clause, conflicting with the initial fixed term. This creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration and renewal conditions.",

In the event that PivX changes the Third Party prices, Per Copy Fees based on such changed prices shall apply to any order for Qwik-Fix Pro received by PivX after the effective date of the increase. PivX shall provide Detto with at least forty-five (45) days written notice of any increase in the Per Copy Fees.",
                "changed_text": "Detto shall pay to PivX for each unit of Qwik-Fix Pro distributed hereunder per copy fees (the \"Per Copy Fees\") as governed by the terms set forth in Exhibit A. PivX may change the Per Copy Fees at any time, effective immediately upon notification to Detto. In certain circumstances, as defined solely by PivX, a retroactive discount may be applied, but PivX is under no obligation to offer such discounts.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates a 45-day notice period for Per Copy Fee increases. The modified text allows immediate price changes, creating a direct contradiction. This introduces uncertainty for Detto regarding pricing stability and predictability, potentially leading to disputes.",

However, PivX reserves the right to terminate Detto's access to ChannelNet at any time, with or without cause, and without prior notice. PivX is not liable for any damages resulting from the termination of ChannelNet access.",
                "explanation": "Originally, access to PivX ChannelNet is presented as governed by Exhibit A, implying some defined terms and conditions. The change introduces an arbitrary right for PivX to terminate access at any time, contradicting the idea of governance by Exhibit A and creating uncertainty regarding the reliability and scope of Detto's access.",

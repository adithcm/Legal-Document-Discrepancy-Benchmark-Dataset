                "explanation": "Introduces a conflict regarding payment terms. Section 4.1 defers to Sections 1.3 and 1.4, which outline a payment schedule based on milestones. Adding 'all invoices must be paid within 15 days' creates a contradiction, as payment is now due within 15 days of invoice receipt, regardless of whether the milestones have been achieved.",

Such invoice shall be addressed to Adaptimmune and sent by electronic mail to accounts@adaptimmune.com with copies to lini.pandite@adaptimmune.com and susan cousounis@adaptimmune.com for Clinical Study payments and with copies to Samik.basu@adaptimmune.com in relation to Pre-clinical Study payments.",
                "changed_text": "All payments will be paid by Adaptimmune within 45 days of receipt of an invoice from MD Anderson. However, if MD Anderson delivers the invoice in person, payments will be paid by Adaptimmune within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from MD Anderson. Such invoice shall be addressed to Adaptimmune and sent by electronic mail to accounts@adaptimmune.com with copies to lini.pandite@adaptimmune.com and susan cousounis@adaptimmune.com for Clinical Study payments and with copies to Samik.basu@adaptimmune.com in relation to Pre-clinical Study payments.",
                "explanation": "Introduces a payment method contingency that contradicts the established 45-day payment term. Regular invoicing is 45 days, but personal invoicing reduces it to 10 days, creating uncertainty and potentially leading to disputes. It's now unclear which term applies based on invoice delivery method.",

However, any information disclosed orally is considered Non-Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the definition of Confidential Information in Section 5.1. Initially, the definition includes information disclosed in writing, orally, graphically, or in machine-readable form. The added sentence explicitly excludes orally disclosed information from being considered confidential, thus conflicting with the initial inclusive definition. It creates uncertainty on whether oral information is protected.",

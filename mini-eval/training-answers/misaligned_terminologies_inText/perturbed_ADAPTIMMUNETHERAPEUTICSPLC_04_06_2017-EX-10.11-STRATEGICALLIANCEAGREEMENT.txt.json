                "original_text": "Adaptimmune agrees to commit funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the term (\"Alliance Funding\"). The JSC may allocate and/or re-allocate funds to Studies as necessary and agreed by JSC.",
                "changed_text": "Adaptimmune agrees to commit funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the term (\"Alliance Funding\"). The JSC may, at its sole discretion, adjust funds to Studies as necessary.",
                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity and contradiction by changing 'allocate and/or re-allocate funds to Studies as necessary and agreed by JSC' to 'adjust funds to Studies as necessary', granting the JSC unilateral control without requiring agreement from both parties. This creates uncertainty about whether Adaptimmune has a say in how the funds are spent.",

All reasonable fees associated with the wind-down activities and final monitoring visit shall be paid by Adaptimmune, to the extent not covered by Alliance Funding.",

All fees associated with the wind-down activities and final monitoring visit shall be split equally by Adaptimmune and MD Anderson, regardless of Alliance Funding.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding who is responsible for the fees associated with winding down a study. The original text states that Adaptimmune pays 'all reasonable fees...to the extent not covered by Alliance Funding', whereas the modified text states that all fees are split equally by Adaptimmune and MD Anderson 'regardless of Alliance Funding.' This uncertainty could lead to disputes.",

Adaptimmune shall not be responsible for expenses to the extent that they are due to pre-existing medical conditions, underlying disease, or the negligence or intentional misconduct or due to breach of this Agreement by MD Anderson or Principal Investigator.",

                "explanation": "This modifies 'shall assume responsibility' to 'may, at its sole discretion, cover', which introduces ambiguity regarding Adaptimmune's obligation to cover medical expenses. In original text, it's a requirement but in the changed one, it is up to Adaptimmune's decision. This contradiction creates uncertainty about patient care costs.",

By removing the asterisks, it suggests that Adaptimmune does have a unilateral right to terminate, but the grounds are unknown because the text is still omitted as the text references Section 1.2 above. Thus Section 1.2 is an essential condition for Adaptimmune to terminate, but the details are omitted.",

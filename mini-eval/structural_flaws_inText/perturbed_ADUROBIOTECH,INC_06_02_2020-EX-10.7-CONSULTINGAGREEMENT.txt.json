                "original_text": "Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\"). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent, if any, that Consultant has rights in or to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (\"Aduro IP\"), Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to Aduro, and to the extent that an executory assignment is not enforceable, Consultant hereby agrees to assign and transfer to Aduro, in writing, from time to time, upon request, any and all right, title, or interest that Consultant has or may obtain in any Work Product and/or Aduro IP without the necessity of further consideration. Aduro shall be entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto. At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product. Such assistance may include, but will not be limited to, signing applications and other documents, cooperating in legal proceedings, and taking any other steps considered necessary or desirable by Aduro.",
                "changed_text": "Aduro shall have the option to become the owner of any writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\"). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent, if any, that Consultant has rights in or to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (\"Aduro IP\"), ownership of Aduro IP will be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the Consultant's contribution, and subject to a separate written agreement between Aduro and the Consultant. Aduro may obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto at its sole discretion. Consultant will only assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product if the consultant is compensated fairly.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that Aduro is the 'sole and exclusive owner' of all Work Product. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating that Aduro only has an 'option' to become the owner, contradicting the original statement of exclusive ownership. Additionally, it introduces the concept of determining Aduro IP ownership on a case-by-case basis with the Consultant, which directly conflicts with the earlier statement of Aduro being the sole and exclusive owner. The condition that the Consultant must be compensated to assist Aduro in maintaining ownership also diminishes Aduro's exclusive rights.",

In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief. Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.",
                "changed_text": "From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly solicit any employee of Aduro to terminate employment with Aduro. However, this restriction does not apply to general advertisements or job postings that may inadvertently reach Aduro employees. In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro may be entitled to seek damages, but injunctive relief is not an available remedy.",
                "explanation": "The original clause prohibits both direct and indirect solicitation. The modified version only prohibits direct solicitation, creating an exception for 'general advertisements,' which can be a form of indirect solicitation, thus contradicting the broad prohibition. Furthermore, the original version provides Aduro with 'injunctive relief' as a remedy for breach of contract, but this has been removed from the modified version. This creates a contradiction, as the clause no longer reflects the remedy granted previously.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that any changes or modifications to the agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. The modified clause directly contradicts this by allowing for changes or modifications to be made verbally, as long as they are documented by one party in an email. This creates a clear conflict about the required process for altering the contract terms.",

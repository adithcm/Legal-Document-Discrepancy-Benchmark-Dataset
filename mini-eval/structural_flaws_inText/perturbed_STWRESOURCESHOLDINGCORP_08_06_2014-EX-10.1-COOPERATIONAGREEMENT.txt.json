Subject to the other provisions contained herein, this AGREEMENT shall be for a term of thirty (30) years from the Effective Date, which shall automatically renew from year-to-year thereafter unless terminated by a Party upon sixty (60) days' written notice after the end of the term. Notwithstanding the 30-year term of this agreement, should STW procure sales agreements with customers for a duration of longer than 30 years, STW shall be authorized to maintain and service such contract(s) to the extent of the water volume(s) purchased, and this AGREEMENT shall not terminate during the initial term of any such water supply agreement with a term extending beyond this AGREEMENT.",
                "changed_text": "3.  Term.  Subject to the other provisions contained herein, this AGREEMENT shall be for a term of thirty (30) years from the Effective Date. Renewal of the agreement is subject to negotiation and written agreement between both parties 60 days before the end of the term. Notwithstanding the 30-year term of this agreement, should STW procure sales agreements with customers for a duration of longer than 30 years, COFS has the right to terminate the agreement at the end of the 30 year term, regardless of STW customer contracts. If COFS allows the agreement to continue, the amount of water STW can sell will be subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stated the contract auto-renews for additional 1-year terms, unless terminated with 60 days notice. The modified version says the contract does not automatically renew, instead requiring explicit renegotiation and agreement by both parties before the end of the initial term. In addition, COFS now has the right to terminate the contract even if STW has customer contracts in place.",

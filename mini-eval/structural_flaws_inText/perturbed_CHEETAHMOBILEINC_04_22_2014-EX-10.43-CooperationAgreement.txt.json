                "original_text": "1.1.7 Actual revenues: means the revenues payable by Party B to Party A based on the amount of search traffic generated by Party A's website for Party B, less Party B's related costs and legal taxes and charges. The search traffic generated by Party A for Party B, which forms the basis for calculating the actual revenues, shall be determined by Party B based on its statistical data.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.7 Actual revenues: means the revenues payable by Party B to Party A based on the amount of search traffic generated by Party A's website for Party B, less Party B's related costs and legal taxes and charges. The search traffic generated by Party A for Party B, which forms the basis for calculating the actual revenues, shall be determined by Party A based on its statistical data.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Party B' to 'Party A' in the sentence determining how actual revenues are calculated, it creates a conflict of interest and uncertainty. The original clause stated that Party B determines the search traffic, but the modified clause gives that power to Party A. This contradiction undermines the fairness and enforceability of revenue sharing, as each party now has conflicting claims over the underlying data.",

One month prior to the expiry of the Cooperation Term, the parties may further negotiate the cooperation forms, if fails, this Agreement will be terminated upon expiry.",

The Agreement will auto-renew for subsequent one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 90 days prior to the end of the current term. One month prior to the expiry of the Cooperation Term, the parties may further negotiate the cooperation forms, if fails, this Agreement will be terminated upon expiry.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'The Agreement will auto-renew for subsequent one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 90 days prior to the end of the current term' creates an in-text contradiction to the previous stated end-date for the agreement. The original clause stated that the agreement terminates upon expiry, whereas the modified clause indicates it auto-renews unless terminated.",

In the event that Party A breaches this covenant, Party B shall have the right to demand penalty and terminate this Agreement at any time and shall not pay any share of profits to Party A.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'demand penalty' in addition to 'terminate this Agreement at any time and shall not pay any share of profits to Party A' creates a contradiction to what rights Party B has for remedy. There isn't any amount or rule that states a penalty for that breach. Therefore, it is not guaranteed for Party B to have a penalty. This introduces uncertianty in remedy.",

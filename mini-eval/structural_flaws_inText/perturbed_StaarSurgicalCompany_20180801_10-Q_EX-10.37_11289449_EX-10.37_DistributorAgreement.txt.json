Distributor shall not sell any Products to a customer if Distributor knows or has reason to believe that such customer intends to remove those Products from the Territory. Distributor acknowledges and agrees that STAAR retains the right to sell the Products in the Territory directly or indirectly, including but not limited to via electronic commerce (without compensation to the Distributor).

The modified version removes the certainty by introducing 'STAAR may choose to give the Distributor some compensation, at their discretion,' making it unclear when the Distributor would be compensated.",

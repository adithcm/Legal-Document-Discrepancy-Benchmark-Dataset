Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without such permission will be voidable.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be assigned by either party with written permission from the other party, which permission may be granted or denied at the sole discretion of the granting party. Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without such permission will be void.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that assignment requires permission that cannot be unreasonably withheld. The modified version states that permission can be granted or denied at the sole discretion of the granting party, which contradicts the original restriction and creates uncertainty about assignment rights.",

The governing law for disputes arising from this agreement will be decided by the courts in the jurisdiction where the dispute occurs.",

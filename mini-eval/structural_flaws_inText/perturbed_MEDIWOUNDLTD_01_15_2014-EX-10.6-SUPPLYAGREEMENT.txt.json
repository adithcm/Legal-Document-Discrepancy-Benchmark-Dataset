                "changed_text": "1.3 \"Bromelain SP\" means material derived from pineapple stems, [having the specification as presented in exhibit 1.13] presently manufactured by CBC at the Facility by a special process and used as a raw material in the production of the Product. However, CBC reserves the right to modify the source material and manufacturing process of Bromelain SP, without notifying MediWound. Any modified version will still be defined as 'Bromelain SP' under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that CBC can modify the source material and manufacturing process of Bromelain SP without notifying MediWound, while still considering it as 'Bromelain SP' under the agreement. This conflicts with Section 5.2, which outlines a process for changes to the specifications, production, or packaging of Bromelain SP, requiring advance notice and approval from MediWound. This creates uncertainty about the actual specifications of the Bromelain SP to be supplied.",

However, CBC reserves the right to nullify this termination by providing an amount of [***] to MediWound. The termination is therefore not guaranteed even after the stipulated notice period.",
                "explanation": "Section 10.1 states that MediWound can terminate the agreement with 6 months notice. This change allows CBC to nullify the termination by providing compensation, introducing uncertainty regarding MediWound's right to terminate. It creates a contradiction regarding the termination rights of MediWound, making the enforcement of the original termination clause ambiguous.",

                "changed_text": "5.8.3 If a recall of the Product is due to CBC or the Bromelain SP, then the recall shall be conducted by MediWound; however, CBC's financial responsibility for the recall, including replacement of Bromelain SP or providing a credit or refund, is subject to CBC's sole discretion and internal financial assessment. CBC will determine the appropriate level of compensation, if any, on a case-by-case basis. CBC's decision in this regard will be final and binding.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by making CBC's financial responsibility for a recall discretionary, despite the original clause stating CBC *shall* replace the Bromelain SP or provide a credit/refund at MediWound's election. By making the financial responsibility subject to CBC's discretion, it creates significant uncertainty about MediWound's remedies in the event of a recall caused by CBC, directly contradicting the original intent of the clause. This will create difficulty in enforcing the responsibility of recall on CBC's side.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement states the Territory is throughout the world, while the modified version restricts it to North America, creating a contradiction. This would affect where Corio is authorized to use and sublicense the Software.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this          Agreement, Changepoint hereby grants to Corio a fee-bearing,          irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable (except in accordance with          Section 14.1 of this Agreement) license in the Territory to (i)          reproduce the Software in machine executable object code format only          for installation on the Corio Servers",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this          Agreement, Changepoint hereby grants to Corio a fee-bearing,          revocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable (except in accordance with          Section 14.1 of this Agreement) license in the Territory to (i)          reproduce the Software in machine executable object code format only          for installation on the Corio Servers",
                "explanation": "The change from 'irrevocable' to 'revocable' completely alters the nature of the license. The original text grants Corio a right that cannot be unilaterally taken back by Changepoint, while the modified version allows Changepoint to revoke the license, creating significant uncertainty for Corio's business operations.",

Changepoint shall provide Corio with          support described in EXHIBIT C hereto, and maintenance in the form of          Updates and Upgrades, subject to Corio's payment of the fees set forth          in EXHIBIT B hereto. Corio shall be responsible for providing its          Customers with routine technical support of the Software (Levels 1 and          2) as described in the schedule set forth in EXHIBIT C hereto.",

Changepoint shall be responsible for providing its Customers with routine technical support of the Software (Levels 1 and          2) as described in the schedule set forth in EXHIBIT C hereto.",
                "explanation": "Changing “shall” to “may, at its sole discretion” makes Changepoint's obligation to provide software support and maintenance optional rather than mandatory. Previously, Changepoint was only obligated to provide Corio Level 3 Support, with Corio responsible for levels 1 and 2. The modified text now indicates that it is the responsibility of Changepoint to provide levels 1 and 2, creating an enforcement ambiguity.",

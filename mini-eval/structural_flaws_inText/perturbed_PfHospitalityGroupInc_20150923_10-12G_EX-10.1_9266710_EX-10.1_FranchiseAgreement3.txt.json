All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",
                "changed_text": "Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member's relationship with Franchisee. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential. However, after the termination of the Franchise Agreement, the definition of confidential information is subject to change and may be determined by a separate agreement or legal precedent.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that confidentiality extends 'thereafter,' meaning even after the Franchise Agreement ends. The changed text introduces uncertainty by saying the definition is 'subject to change' after termination, potentially contradicting the initial indefinite confidentiality. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the scope of confidentiality post-termination.",

                "explanation": "The original clause prohibited competition during the franchise term 'except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor'. The modified version removes the exception of Franchisor approval and introduce a geographical exception. This creates a conflict because the original clause indicates that no competition is permitted, and the modified version permits it if it is more than 100 miles from the Franchise location, creating an uncertainty for the franchisor.",

However, the Franchisor's right to enforce this agreement as a third-party beneficiary is contingent upon the Franchisee's express consent at the time of enforcement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Franchisor has the right to enforce the agreement independently or jointly. The changed text introduces a condition that the Franchisee must provide express consent. This creates a contradiction and makes the Franchisor's rights to enforce the agreement uncertain and dependent on the Franchisee's discretion, potentially undermining the Franchisor's protection.",

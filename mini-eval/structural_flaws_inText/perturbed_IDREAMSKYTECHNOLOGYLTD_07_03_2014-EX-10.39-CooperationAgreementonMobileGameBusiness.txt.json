                "original_text": "10.3 If Party B unilaterally terminates this Agreement, or is penalized with termination of cooperation according to Management Measures for Game Partner Credit Points, or if Party A terminates this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, Party B agrees:\n\n  (1) to offer one-month exit grace period during which Party B shall continue to provide services for customers and publish announcementin respect of the cease of its services at its website;\n\n  (2) to pay off penalty fines and performance bond to Party A in full amount; and\n\n  (3) that Party A shall have the right not to settle the outstanding and unsettled payments.",
                "changed_text": "10.3 If Party B unilaterally terminates this Agreement, or is penalized with termination of cooperation according to Management Measures for Game Partner Credit Points, or if Party A terminates this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, Party B agrees:\n\n  (1) to offer one-month exit grace period during which Party B may discontinue services if they wish and publish announcement in respect of the cease of its services at its website if they deem necessary;\n\n  (2) to potentially pay off penalty fines and performance bond to Party A, depending on the circumstances; and\n\n  (3) that Party A will consider settling the outstanding and unsettled payments based on a case-by-case review.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original text. Originally, the clause clearly stated Party B *must* offer a one-month exit period, *must* pay penalties, and that Party A *would not* settle outstanding payments. The revised clause makes these obligations conditional and discretionary. Party B 'may' discontinue services and 'if they deem necessary' publish an announcement. The obligation to pay penalties is 'potential' and 'depending on circumstances', and Party A will only 'consider settling' based on a 'case-by-case review.' This contradicts the original mandatory language, creating uncertainty about the actual requirements and financial obligations upon termination.",

As of the effective date hereof, the original cooperation of mobile game business executed between the Parties shall terminate automatically. Upon the expiry of this Agreement, this Agreement may be renewed automatically for one year (but can only be renewed once) if neither Party raises objection. Except otherwise agreed between the parties, the contents of this Agreement shall remain binding throughout the renewed period.",
                "changed_text": "13.1 This Agreement shall come into force as of January 1, 2013 and remain valid for 1 year. As of the effective date hereof, the original cooperation of mobile game business executed between the Parties shall terminate automatically. Upon the expiry of this Agreement, renewal shall be subject to further negotiation and the parties shall agree to execute an amendment in order to continue the cooperation or this agreement terminates automatically. Except otherwise agreed between the parties, the contents of this Agreement shall remain binding throughout the renewed period.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that the agreement would automatically renew, while the modified clause dictates that renewal will be a result of further negotiation between the parties. Therefore, if the parties do not agree to an amendment and sign it, the agreement terminates regardless of the initial wording. This introduces contradiction and uncertainty, especially with the last phrase that states the agreement shall remain binding throughout the renewed period. This statement is therefore contradicted by the earlier rewording of this clause.",

                "explanation": "The original text states Party B *will* pay a performance bond. The modified version states Party B *may* pay, and that the payment is optional. This directly contradicts the original mandatory language, creating uncertainty as to whether Party B is actually required to provide the performance bond.",

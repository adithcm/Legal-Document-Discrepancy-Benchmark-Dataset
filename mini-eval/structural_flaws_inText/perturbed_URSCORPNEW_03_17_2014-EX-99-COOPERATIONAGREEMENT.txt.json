                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding JANA's ability to make disparaging statements about the Company. Initially, JANA is restricted from making statements that disparage the Company or its representatives, but the added text encourages JANA to aggressively challenge and criticize the Company's announcements. This creates an unclear and conflicting standard, which could result in disagreement over the bounds of acceptable statements made by JANA.",

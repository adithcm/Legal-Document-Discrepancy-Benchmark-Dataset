                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice. Renewal of this agreement is subject to negotiation and written agreement by both parties at least thirty (30) days before the anniversary of the original agreement. If no agreement is reached, the agreement will automatically be extended for another 12 months unless the other party notifies by email that they don't agree.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic renewal unless one party provides written notice 90 days prior. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating that renewal is subject to negotiation and written agreement, yet also states that unless the other party notifies by email that they don't agree, then the agreement automatically extends for another 12 months, creating ambiguity as to whether explicit agreement is required or not.",

                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and delivered through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee at Fazync's sole discretion. The fee will be paid NET 90 days after receipt of payment from the client to Fazync.",
                "explanation": "The original clause guarantees a lead-finder fee between 10% and 20%, with the specific percentage determined by project factors, payable NET 30. The modified version contradicts this by stating the fee is at Fazync's 'sole discretion', removing the guaranteed range, and changes the payment terms to NET 90 days, creating financial uncertainty for Bravatek.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates strict confidentiality with specific exceptions. The modified version introduces an exception allowing disclosure to potential investors or acquirers, contradicting the initial strict confidentiality requirement and creating uncertainty about the scope of 'Confidential Information'.",

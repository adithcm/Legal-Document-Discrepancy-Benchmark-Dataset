                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A  Confidential  Information@  shall  mean  any  and  all information  that a Party may reasonably  expect to remain  confidential and not shared with the general public at any time or that information that is protected by law.",
                "changed_text": "A Confidential Information shall mean any and all information clearly marked as confidential and approved by both parties as such, prior to any disclosure. Information not explicitly labelled and mutually approved as confidential will not be treated as such under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' is broad, encompassing any information a party 'may reasonably expect' to be confidential. The modified version restricts this definition to only information 'clearly marked as confidential and approved by both parties.' This creates a contradiction, as the original definition suggests a reasonable expectation is sufficient, while the modified definition requires explicit labeling and mutual agreement, potentially excluding information that would otherwise be considered confidential.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that either party can terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice. The modified version introduces a contradiction by stating that UDC can terminate with or without prior notice, while the Business Affiliate requires 90 days' notice. This creates an imbalance of power and uncertainty regarding the termination rights of each party.",

                "changed_text": "UDC will not indemnify the Business Affiliate for any actions. The Business Affiliate will indemnify and hold harmless UDC, its agents, and representatives from any and all losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, claims, demands, judgments, and settlements of every nature incurred by UDC due to the Business Affiliate's actions, whether permitted or not.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes mutual indemnification. The modified version eliminates UDC's obligation to indemnify the Business Affiliate and expands the Business Affiliate's indemnification obligation to cover all actions, even those permitted by the agreement. This creates a direct contradiction and a significant shift in liability, potentially discouraging the Business Affiliate from acting under the contract.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of clarity, Commercial Reasonably Efforts will not, in any way, shape or form, apply for AbbVie and their Affiliates or sublicensees, under the Harpoon and AbbVie agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' is intentionally left incomplete, represented by '[***]', making its exact meaning ambiguous. The added text explicitly states that this definition does not apply to AbbVie, its affiliates, or sublicensees under the Harpoon and AbbVie agreement. This is contradictory because it removes any obligation for AbbVie to act with 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' in any part of the contract that is in connection with the Harpoon and AbbVie Agreement. This could cause issues in Article 4 Section 4.2 where it states 'AbbVie shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Commercialize' ",

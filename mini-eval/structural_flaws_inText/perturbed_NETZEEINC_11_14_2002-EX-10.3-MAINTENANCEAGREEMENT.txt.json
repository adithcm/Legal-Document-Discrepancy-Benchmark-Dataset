                "original_text": "The maintenance is for a period of one (1) year commencing upon expiration of the initial one (1) year term of the License/Services Schedule. Following the completion of such maintenance term, Bankers Bank may, at its option, renew maintenance for subsequent periods of one (1) year each, subject to adjustments proposed by Netzee not to exceed 5% at least sixty (60) days in advance of the applicable renewal date.",
                "changed_text": "The maintenance is for a period of one (1) year commencing upon expiration of the initial one (1) year term of the License/Services Schedule. Following the completion of such maintenance term, renewal for subsequent periods is subject to Netzee's sole discretion and any price adjustments they deem necessary, with no advance notice required.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Bankers Bank has the option to renew, subject to a maximum 5% price increase with 60 days' notice. The modified text gives Netzee the sole discretion for renewal and removes the limitations on price increases and the notice period, contradicting the initial agreement and creating uncertainty about renewal terms.",

                "changed_text": "Maintenance provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement may include standard maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally, subject to resource availability and prioritization. Netzee will make commercially reasonable efforts to comply with industry and regulatory requirements, but compliance is not guaranteed. Call-in support availability is subject to change without notice. Uptime availability is targeted at 99%, but Netzee is not liable for downtime resulting from any cause.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies mandatory inclusion of maintenance upgrades, reasonable efforts to meet industry standards, fixed call-in support hours, and a guaranteed 99% uptime. The modified version introduces 'may include' and 'subject to', making upgrades discretionary. The guarantee of meeting industry standards is reduced to a non-binding effort, the call-in times can change without notice, and the 99% uptime changes to a non-binding target, with no liability for downtime, directly contradicting the original guarantees and reducing the certainty of the maintenance services.",

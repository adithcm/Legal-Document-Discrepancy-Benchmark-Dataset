                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement is valid for an indefinite term, creating certainty. The modified text contradicts this by stating that the agreement can be terminated with 30 days notice, introducing uncertainty and a conflicting term length.",

The modified text contradicts this by mandating mutual agreement, and resorting to the section on dispute resolution should there be no agreement, creating uncertainty in who has final interpretive authority. It introduces an element of negotiation that did not exist before.",

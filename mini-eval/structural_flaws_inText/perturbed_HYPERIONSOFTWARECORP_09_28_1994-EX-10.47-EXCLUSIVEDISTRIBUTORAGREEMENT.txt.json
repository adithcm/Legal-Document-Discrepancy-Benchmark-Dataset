Distributor shall distribute the Products to existing and new customers of Distributor located in the Territory (the \"End-Users\") who enter into an End-User License Agreement (as hereinafter defined).

The Products distributed to End-Users shall be in executable object code form only. Distributor shall not itself, nor allow others to modify, translate, decompile, nor create or attempt to create, by reverse engineering or otherwise, the source code from the object code of the Products supplied hereunder, or adapt the Products in any way or for use to create a derivative work. Should Distributor wish to create such a derivative work, Distributor must first seek and obtain express written permission to do so from the Developer and Developer may withold such permission at its sole discretion.

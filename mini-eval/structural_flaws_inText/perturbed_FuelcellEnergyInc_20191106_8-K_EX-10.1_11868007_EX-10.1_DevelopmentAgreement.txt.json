FCE will promptly disclose to ExxonMobil, in written or other tangible form, any and all Program Information including any Program Inventions. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, FCE agrees to hold Program Information in confidence, and not to disclose or make it available to any third party without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending twenty (20) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, FCE agrees to use and practice Program Information only for the Program or as authorized in Article 7 (License to Program Results).",

FCE will promptly disclose to ExxonMobil, in written or other tangible form, any and all Program Information including any Program Inventions. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, FCE agrees to hold Program Information in confidence, and not to disclose or make it available to any third party without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending five (5) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, FCE agrees to use and practice Program Information only for the Program or as authorized in Article 7 (License to Program Results).",
                "explanation": "Section 4.01 originally stated that FCE must hold Program Information in confidence for twenty years after the Effective Date. By changing this to five years, it introduces a contradiction with Section 12.06, which states that Article 4 survives the termination of the agreement. This means that even after the agreement terminates, FCE is still bound by the five-year confidentiality restriction mentioned in Article 4. However, depending on how soon the contract terminates, this might reduce the protection offered to ExxonMobil because the confidentiality of the Program Information lasts for a shorter time.",

The Agreement is not assignable, including any assignment by operation of law (including but not limited to as a result of a merger or other corporate action), by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any and all assignments of this Agreement or of any part thereof not made in accordance with this Article will be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ExxonMobil may assign this Agreement to its Affiliates and FCE may assign this Agreement to any of its wholly-owned and wholly-controlled Affiliates, with prior written notice to the other Party, provided that (i) such assignment by FCE shall be void if at any point such Affiliate ceases to be both wholly-owned and wholly- controlled by FCE, (ii) Article 12, including but not limited to Paragraphs 12.03, 12.04 and 12.05, shall be applicable to both FCE and any Affiliate assignee of FCE, and (iii) no assignment pursuant to this sentence will relieve the Parties of their obligations under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text of Section 14.01 strictly limits assignment of the agreement, requiring written consent from the other party unless it's an assignment to affiliates with prior notice. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating that the agreement is freely assignable to any third party without consent, while simultaneously prohibiting assignment to affiliates without prior notice. This creates a contradiction as it allows assignment to non-affiliated third parties without consent but strangely restricts assignment to affiliates, causing confusion and uncertainty about the valid means of assignment.",

But the modified text contradicts this payment obligation by stating that, \"In the event of termination by ExxonMobil, ExxonMobil will not be responsible for any payments or expenses of FCE\" It creates a direct contradiction within the same clause, leading to uncertainty and enforceability issues regarding ExxonMobil's financial responsibilities in the event of early termination.",

In such case, both parties are required to mutually agree to make specific actions regarding the situation, and a formal investigation shall be held to decide whether the party at fault can solve the issue at hand. A full detailed report will be drafted in order to have all details on paper to present to the executive commitee of both parts and they shall decide if the contract will be terminated or amended accordingly.",

The modified version removes this certainty by stating that parties can, in fact, terminate the agreement without notice in the event of a breach, and adding a convoluted process for solving such issues. This creates uncertainty regarding the termination procedure.",

                "original_text": "1.1 TRANSPORTATION QUANTITY - shall mean the maximum daily quantity of gas which Transporter agrees to receive and transport on a firm basis, subject to Article II herein, for the account of Shipper hereunder on each day during each year during the term hereof, which shall be 51,000 dekatherms. Any limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery shall be as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 TRANSPORTATION QUANTITY - shall mean the estimated daily quantity of gas which Transporter may receive and transport on a non-firm basis, not subject to Article II herein, for the account of Shipper hereunder on certain days during each year during the term hereof, which may be up to 51,000 dekatherms. Specific limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery may or may not be specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original definition of \"TRANSPORTATION QUANTITY\" by changing \"maximum daily quantity\" to \"estimated daily quantity,\" \"agrees to receive and transport on a firm basis\" to \"may receive and transport on a non-firm basis,\" making the transportation quantity less certain and creating an internal contradiction with other sections that rely on a firm, fixed quantity. Also, it changes the 'shall be' to 'may be' which creates an internal contradiction about the amount",

                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty regarding the contract's duration. The original text clearly states the contract remains in effect until a specific date. The modified version uses \"may remain\" and adds caveats like \"subject to regulatory approval and market conditions,\" creating a contradiction. This weakens the enforceability of the term and creates confusion about the contract's end date.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that \"any notice... shall be in writing and mailed to the post office address.\" The modified clause contradicts this by stating that notice \"may be in writing, email, or verbally communicated,\" and that the listed addresses are \"for informational purposes only.\" This creates uncertainty about the required method of providing notice under the agreement, potentially leading to disputes about whether proper notice was given.",

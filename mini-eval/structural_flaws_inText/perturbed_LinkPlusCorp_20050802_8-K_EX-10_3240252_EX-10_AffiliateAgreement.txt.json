TERM\n\n        This Agreement will remain in force for an initial term of one (1) year, automatically renewing for subsequent one (1) year terms, unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this agreement can be terminated at any time by either party with or without cause, effective immediately upon written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement is perpetual unless mutually amended or agreed to be terminated. The modified text introduces a fixed term with automatic renewal but then contradicts itself by allowing termination at any time by either party, effectively negating the fixed term and renewal clause. This creates uncertainty about the intended duration of the agreement.",

Axiometric will have                   access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections,                   conference room, and printers.\n\n         2.3      If LKPL requires space used by Axiometric for LKPL's own                   purposes, then LKPL will attempt in good faith but without                   having any obligation to continue to provide Axiometric with                   comparable space. If LKPL deems itself unable to continue to                   provide Axiometric work space without expanding LKPL's                   facilities, and if LKPL determines it will be in its own best                   interests to expand its facilities, then LKPL will afford                   Axiometric the opportunity to lease space in the new                   facilities under a mutually acceptable separate commercial                   rental agreement. If Axiometric does not then wish to rent                   office space from LKPL, then LKPL may terminate Axiometric's                   license to use work space in LKPL's facility upon 60 days                   notice.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the office space is provided free of charge. The modified text contradicts this by stating that Axiometric must pay $5000 per month for the space and market rates for related services. Furthermore, where LKPL originally had the obligation to attempt in good faith to provide comparable space, the modified text states it has no obligation and can terminate the license with 30 days notice and no recourse. This creates a clear conflict regarding the financial terms of the office space arrangement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states payments are due 45 days after the close of the calendar quarter, with interest accruing after 30 days past due and material breach occurring after 60 days past due. The modified text changes the payment due date to 90 days and accelerates the interest accrual to 15 days past due. Most importantly, it then introduces a condition that payments are contingent on LKPL obtaining external funding or achieving positive cash flow, effectively negating the payment timeline outlined previously. This creates uncertainty regarding when payments are actually due, if ever, and under what circumstances LKPL might be in breach.",

                "changed_text": "D.  Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within thirty (30) days of the Invoice date may, at PCQ's sole discretion, be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of up to 1.5% per month. The corresponding ANNUAL\n\nPERCENTAGE RATE will be determined by PCQ on a case-by-case basis for all outstanding balances.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a fixed finance charge of 1.0% per month for late payments. The modified text introduces ambiguity by saying the finance charge is discretionary and can be 'up to 1.5%', and annual percentage rate will be determined by PCQ. This contradicts the initial fixed rate and creates uncertainty.",

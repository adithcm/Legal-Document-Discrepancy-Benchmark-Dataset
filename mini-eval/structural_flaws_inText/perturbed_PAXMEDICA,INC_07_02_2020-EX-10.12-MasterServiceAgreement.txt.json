                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.6 CRO may not subcontract any parts of the Services to a third party without the prior written approval of Client, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld. CRO will remain fully liable for the acts and omissions of its employees and approved subcontractors as if performed by CRO.",
                "changed_text": "1.6 CRO may freely subcontract parts of the Services to any third party it deems suitable, without requiring prior approval from Client. The Client acknowledges that CRO's subcontractors operate independently, and CRO will not be liable for their acts or omissions.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. The original clause stated that subcontractors require client approval. The modified version states no approval is needed and removes CRO's liability for subcontractor actions, contradicting the original full liability clause.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice if the other materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however that the party in breach shall have the right to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the other party's intention to terminate.",
                "changed_text": "4.1. Either party may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice if the other materially breaches this Agreement. The breaching party is not entitled to a cure period, and the termination will be effective immediately upon the expiration of the thirty-day notice period.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the breaching party a 30-day cure period. The modified text removes this cure period, stating the termination becomes effective after the notice period regardless of whether the breach is remedied. This creates a direct contradiction regarding termination rights.",

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each party's total liability in respect of damages under this Agreement, any regulation or common law shall be limited to the sum of all amounts received from Client in terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply with respect to any claims arising out of or relating to clause 6 (Inventions and Proprietary Information), indemnification obligations or damages arising from a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "changed_text": "5.4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each party's total liability in respect of damages under this Agreement, any regulation or common law shall be limited to $500. This limitation applies to all claims, without exception, including those arising out of clause 6 (Inventions and Proprietary Information), indemnification obligations or damages arising from a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits liability to the amount received from the client, but creates exceptions for specific claims. The modified text imposes a fixed liability limit ($500) and removes all exceptions, thereby contradicting the provision for unlimited liability under certain circumstances in the original text.",

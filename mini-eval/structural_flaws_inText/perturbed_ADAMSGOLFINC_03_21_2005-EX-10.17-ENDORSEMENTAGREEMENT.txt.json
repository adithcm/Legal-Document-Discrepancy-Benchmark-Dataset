                "explanation": "The original clause states that the CONSULTANT *shall* achieve a minimum number of tournaments and *shall* repay ADAMS GOLF if the minimum is not met. The modified version weakens this by saying CONSULTANT *shall endeavor* to achieve minimum and *may* be required to repay *at ADAMS GOLF's sole discretion.* Also it changes the payment period to a notification basis, implying the repayment isn't guaranteed. This weakens the enforceability of the repayment obligation.",

The modified version changes this to ADAMS GOLF *intends* to pay, and adds conditions for payment (financial performance, continued evaluation of brand value). This introduces uncertainty as to whether the base compensation will actually be paid, despite the initial agreement, which makes it difficult to predict future payments.",

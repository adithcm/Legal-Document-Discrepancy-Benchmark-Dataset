DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION\n1.1 In this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires the following words shall have the following meaning: \"AFFILIATES\" means any company, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with XFN; \"CONTENT\" means real-time economic news including articles, reports, data, information and such materials that have or have been and/or will be published from time to time and that is or will be in the possession or control of CEIS from time to time, in respect of the subject matters as more particularly described in Schedule 1; EFFECTIVE DATE means 18 May 2000; \"INTELLECTUAL means patents, trade marks, service marks, trade names, PROPERTY RIGHTS\" design rights (whether registrable or not), any applications for the foregoing, copyright and other assignable intellectual property -1- rights (whether registrable or not) in any country, including but not limited to the format, layout, and the look and feel of any of the Content; \"TERM\" means the term as set out in Clause 7; and \"TERRITORY\" means the world excluding the People's Republic of China.",

DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION\n1.1 In this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires the following words shall have the following meaning: \"AFFILIATES\" means any company, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with XFN; \"CONTENT\" means any information or data provided by CEIS, the specific nature of which shall be determined at CEIS's sole discretion; EFFECTIVE DATE means 18 May 2000; \"INTELLECTUAL means patents, trade marks, service marks, trade names, PROPERTY RIGHTS\" design rights (whether registrable or not), any applications for the foregoing, copyright and other assignable intellectual property -1- rights (whether registrable or not) in any country, including but not limited to the format, layout, and the look and feel of any of the Content; \"TERM\" means the term as set out in Clause 7; and \"TERRITORY\" means the world excluding the People's Republic of China.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'CONTENT' specifies 'real-time economic news including articles, reports, data, information and such materials'. The changed definition broadens this to 'any information or data provided by CEIS, the specific nature of which shall be determined at CEIS's sole discretion.' This creates a conflict because the original definition provides a specific scope, while the modified definition allows CEIS to unilaterally change the type of content provided, potentially undermining XFN's expectations and business model. This introduces uncertainty regarding what XFN is actually licensing and what CEIS is obligated to provide.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement allows XFN to terminate with 30 days notice, and both parties can terminate for material breach or insolvency. Also, the original clause 8.3(b) states XFN shall recover any sums paid to CEIS in advance for the unexpired term. However, the modified clause 8.2 now states that CEIS may terminate at any time, for any reason, without notice or liability to XFN. Additionally, the modified clause 8.3(b) states that XFN shall forfeit any sums paid to CEIS in advance. This is contradictory because it introduces imbalance and conflict on termination rights and liabilities.",

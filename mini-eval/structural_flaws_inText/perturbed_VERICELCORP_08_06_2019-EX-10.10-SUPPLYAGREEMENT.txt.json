During the first five (5) years of the Term, with respect to the Bulk Vehicle Gel, Intermediate Drug Product and Finished Product, Vericel shall order and purchase such Products exclusively from MediWound in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, Vericel may Manufacture or have Manufactured the Products (a) upon the occurrence of a Supply Failure with respect to any Product hereunder, or (b) as otherwise permitted under the terms of the License Agreement or this Agreement. The Parties agree that nothing in this Section 2.2 is intended to limit the identification, evaluation, technology transfer or validation by Vericel of (x) a Second Source for the Manufacture and supply of Product or (y) a provider of filling and packaging services for Product, and that such activities are expressly permitted hereunder.",

During the first five (5) years of the Term, with respect to the Bulk Vehicle Gel, Intermediate Drug Product and Finished Product, Vericel shall endeavor to order and purchase such Products exclusively from MediWound in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, Vericel may Manufacture or have Manufactured the Products (a) upon the occurrence of a Supply Failure with respect to any Product hereunder, or (b) as otherwise permitted under the terms of the License Agreement or this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Changing \"Vericel shall order and purchase such Products exclusively\" to \"Vericel shall endeavor to order and purchase such Products exclusively\" weakens the exclusivity obligation. The original text imposes a strict requirement, while the modified text introduces ambiguity, making enforcement of the exclusive supply agreement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "Adding \"however, MediWound reserves the right to terminate at any time with six months' notice\" creates a conflict. The original text outlines a specific term and renewal process controlled by Vericel. The added clause allows MediWound to terminate at any time, contradicting the term length agreed upon.",

Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1. This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties and the name of a Party appearing herein shall be deemed to include the names of such Party's successors and permitted assigns to the extent necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Changing \"Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer\" to \"Each Party may choose to promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer\" removes the mandatory nature of notification. While the opening sentence prevents assignment without consent, this change introduces ambiguity because notification is not guaranteed. The result is the affected party may not know of the assignment and can be left in dark, which affects obligations.",

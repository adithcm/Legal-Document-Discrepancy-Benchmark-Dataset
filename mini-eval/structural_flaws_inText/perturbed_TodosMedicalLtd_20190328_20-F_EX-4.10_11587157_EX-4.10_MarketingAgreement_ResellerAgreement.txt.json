                "original_text": "1. Grant of Rights 1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Todos hereby grants the Reseller a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, exclusive right to distribute and sell the Products to Customers in the Territory; provided, however, that Reseller may sub-license or transfer its distribution rights to a subsidiary or affiliate of the Reseller. The Reseller shall have a right of first refusal to include within this Agreement any additional products developed, manufactured, or sold by the Company following the Effective Date that are not currently included in Exhibit A, and upon the exercise of such right, the term \"Products\" shall be expanded to mean such additional products as well. For purposes of clarity, the parties agree that upon Todos's development of a blood screening test for colon cancer, such product shall be added to this Agreement and included within the definition of \"Products\", subject to the Reseller and Todos agreeing on the commercial terms for such product, including the price. 1.2 The Reseller shall not market, distribute, or sell the Products, whether directly or indirectly, to customers outside of the Territory. This Section 1.2 is a fundamental provision of this Agreement. 1.3 Subject to Section 1.4 below, Todos shall not market, distribute, or sell the Products, whether directly or indirectly, to customers inside of the Territory in any manner other than through the Reseller.",

                "explanation": "Section 1.2 originally prohibits the Reseller from selling outside the territory. The modified version allows sales outside the territory with written consent from Todos. This contradicts the initial exclusivity grant by making it unclear whether the Reseller has an exclusive territory or if Todos can allow other parties to sell into the same markets.",

Exclusivity 2.1 The Reseller's exclusive right to market and sell the Products in the Territory is subject to the Reseller achieving the following milestones by the end of each year this Agreement is in effect (the \"Annual Milestones\"): Year Annual Milestone(s) Year 1 Not Applicable Each Year Thereafter The parties will agree at the beginning of the year on the Annual Milestone for such year 2.2 If the Reseller sells less than 50% of any year's Annual Milestone, Todos, in its sole discretion, may either (a) cancel the Reseller's exclusivity, and market, distribute, and sell the Products in the Territory directly or indirectly through other distributors and resellers, while leaving the Reseller with a non-exclusive right to distribute and sell the Products for the remainder of the term, or (b) terminate the Agreement upon one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice, provided that the Reseller does not cure its failure to achieve 50% of the applicable year's Annual Milestone within the 180-day notice period.",

                "explanation": "Originally, the consequences for not achieving 50% of the Annual Milestone were clear: Todos could either cancel the Reseller's exclusivity or terminate the agreement. The modified text introduces the option for Todos to retroactively modify the Annual Milestones. This creates uncertainty because it allows Todos to change the targets after the fact, making it difficult for the Reseller to plan and comply, and making the concept of 'exclusivity' based on achieving milestones less meaningful and enforceable.",

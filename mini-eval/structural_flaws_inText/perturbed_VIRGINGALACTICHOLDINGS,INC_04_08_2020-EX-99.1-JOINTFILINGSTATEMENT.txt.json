                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G may or may not be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned, with the decision at the sole discretion of the filing party, and filing additional joint acquisition statements may be required. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall also be fully responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others regardless of whether they know or have reason to believe such information is inaccurate.",
                "explanation": "The original text states amendments will be filed on behalf of each undersigned party, creating a clear obligation. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating amendments 'may or may not' be filed, contradicting the original certainty. The original text limits responsibility for others' information to cases of known inaccuracy. The modified text eliminates this limitation, making each party fully responsible for the accuracy of all information, even if they lack knowledge of inaccuracies. This creates a contradiction and uncertainty regarding the scope of liability.",

                "explanation": "The original consistently shows Thomas Sipp as Chief Financial Officer signing for each entity. The modified version omits the signature block for SCULPTOR MASTER FUND LTD but still maintains Thomas Sipp signing for the last entity. This creates uncertainty as to whether the master fund agreed to be part of this agreement, because there is no proof of signature for that section. The lack of a complete signature block for one entity could cause uncertainty around whether all original parties agree to this arrangement or not.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "4. This contract shall be for a term of one year commencing on the date first above written; thereafter, it shall automatically continue until terminated by either party upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "4. This contract shall be for a term of one year commencing on the date first above written; thereafter, it may continue indefinitely, or be terminated by either party, with the mutual agreement of both parties. Termination requires good faith negotiation and may be subject to penalties as described in later amendments.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause, which specified an automatic renewal with a simple 30-day notice. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the contract 'may' continue, requiring mutual agreement for termination, and alluding to potential penalties. It is now unclear whether the contract renews automatically or requires explicit action.",

                "original_text": "All sums due under any invoice shall be payable without discount upon receipt of the invoice. Amounts more than 30 days past due shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment at the lesser of 1) the rate of interest established by Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, NY, from time to time as its prime rate, plus two (2) percent, or 2) the maximum non-usurious interest rate which may be charged Shipper pursuant to applicable Texas law, Article 5069-1.04 Texas Rev. Civ. Stat., as amended.",
                "changed_text": "All sums due under any invoice should be paid, within a reasonable time, at Carrier's discretion. Amounts past due, at Carrier's discretion, may bear interest from a date Carrier determines is equitable. The interest rate, if any, will be decided on a case-by-case basis by Carrier, considering prevailing market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text firmly stated that invoices must be paid upon receipt and specified a clear process for interest on late payments. The modified clause weakens this by stating sums 'should' be paid, giving Carrier complete discretion over payment timing and interest rates. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the initial, clear payment terms.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The terms and conditions of this contract and all information concerning the business, customers, products, and processes of each party which may come into the possession of the other party during the course of the negotiation or performance of this contract are confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, either party may disclose information concerning this contract to any independent public accounting firm retained to perform an annual financial audit of that party.  This obligation of confidentiality shall expire two (2) years from the date of the last shipment under this contract.",
                "changed_text": "The terms and conditions of this contract and all information concerning the business, customers, products, and processes of each party which may come into the possession of the other party during the course of the negotiation or performance of this contract may be considered confidential at the sole discretion of each party and disclosure to third parties is permissible as each party deems appropriate, considering legal and business obligations. Any obligation of confidentiality described within this section shall remain in force, subject to termination at the discretion of either party upon written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulated a clear confidentiality agreement lasting two years. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating confidentiality is 'may be considered' and 'permissible as each party deems appropriate', contradicting the original mandatory language and eliminating the two-year time limit. This contradiction undermines the confidentiality agreement.",

                "original_text": "AEIS reserves the right at any time, with or without cause, with reasonable written notice to Schoolpop, to cancel or decline any Client's participation in the Program.",
                "changed_text": "AEIS reserves the right at any time, with or without cause, without written notice to Schoolpop, to cancel or decline any Client's participation in the Program.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that AEIS can cancel a Client's participation with 'reasonable written notice' while the changed version states that AEIS can do so 'without written notice' contradicting the original clause. This change introduces uncertainty about the Client's participation and whether AEIS will follow up with documentation regarding their choice of involvement.",

                "original_text": "Schoolpop shall discontinue its use and shall notify its Clients to discontinue use of the Marks, including all American Express merchant marks, and all associated promotions, including but not limited to Client promotions, upon termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop may continue its use and is not obligated to notify its Clients to discontinue use of the Marks, including all American Express merchant marks, and all associated promotions, including but not limited to Client promotions, upon termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Schoolpop must stop using the marks and notify its clients to do the same upon termination. The modified text directly contradicts this by saying Schoolpop may continue its use and does not have to notify its clients. This creates ambiguity about the obligations of Schoolpop and its clients after the contract terminates, potentially leading to disputes over trademark usage.",

                "original_text": "Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement will be effective if in writing and delivered personally, sent by certified U.S. Mail, return receipt requested, postage prepared, sent by a national overnight delivery service (such as Federal Express), or sent by telefax, in each instance addressed and delivered personally or sent for delivery as provided on the signature page of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement will be effective if communicated via telepathy, delivered personally, sent by certified U.S. Mail, return receipt requested, postage prepared, sent by a national overnight delivery service (such as Federal Express), or sent by smoke signal, in each instance addressed and delivered personally or sent for delivery as provided on the signature page of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces the concept of 'telepathy' and 'smoke signals' alongside established methods of written communication. Telepathy and smoke signal are not legally sound and contrasts with the explicit mentioning of 'in writing' in the original, creating ambiguity and uncertainty in the enforceability of the notice clause. This contradiction could lead to arguments over whether a notice was properly given.",

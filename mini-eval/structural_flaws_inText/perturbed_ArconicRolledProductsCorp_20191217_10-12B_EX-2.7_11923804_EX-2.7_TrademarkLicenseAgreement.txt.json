                "original_text": "1.5 Quality Control, Licensor Approvals. Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right at all times to control and approve the nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon), and to inspect Licensee's business operations upon reasonable prior notice for the purpose of ensuring that a high level of quality of the Licensed Products is being maintained by Licensee. At Licensor's reasonable request during each calendar year, Licensee shall submit samples to Licensor, at no cost to Licensor, and shall not materially depart therefrom without Licensor's prior express written consent.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 Quality Control, Licensor Approvals. While Licensor retains ownership of the Licensed Mark, Licensee shall have sole discretion over the nature and quality of the Licensed Products, including the Licensed Mark thereon. Licensor may request samples, but Licensee is not obligated to provide them and can materially depart from any previously submitted samples without Licensor's consent.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. The original states that the Licensor has the right to control and approve the quality of the products, while the modified text gives the Licensee sole discretion. This creates uncertainty about who ultimately decides the quality of the Licensed Products and how the Licensed Mark is used.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such consent of Licensor is required under this Agreement in the event of a Change of Control of Licensee so long as: (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person assumes all the obligations of the Licensee by operation of Law or pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Licensor; and (b) the licenses granted herein shall not be transferrable or sublicensable to Affiliates of such Person unless such Affiliates were Affiliates of Licensee prior to such Change of Control.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change of Control of Licensee, Licensor may terminate this agreement. The decision of whether to proceed with or terminate the contract rests solely with Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text details a situation where consent isn't required. The changed text states that Licensor has the option to terminate the agreement, even if the requirements stated in the original text have been met. This creates uncertainty regarding the conditions under which the contract can be continued or terminated during a Change of Control.",

Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and shall fail to remedy any such default within one hundred twenty (120) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "4.2 Termination for Breach. Licensor may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Licensee in the event the Licensee is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder. Licensor has the discretion to terminate at any time regardless of remediation.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows either party to terminate the agreement after a 120-day notice period for breaches. The modified clause changes this by removing the Licensee's right to terminate. It introduces the Licensor's discretion to terminate the agreement immediately, and regardless of the Licensee's effort in remediation, thus contradicting the 120-day period.",

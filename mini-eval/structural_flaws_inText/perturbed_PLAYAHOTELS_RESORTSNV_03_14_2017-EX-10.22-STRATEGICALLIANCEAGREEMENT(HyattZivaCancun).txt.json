During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the \"Development Term\"), each Party (the \"Offering Party\") agrees to provide to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would acquire the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the \"Development Property\") on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort would operate (a \"Development Opportunity\").",

During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the \"Development Term\"), each Party (the \"Offering Party\") may, at its sole discretion, provide to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would acquire the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the \"Development Property\") on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort would operate (a \"Development Opportunity\").",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'agrees to provide,' creating a mandatory obligation. The modified text uses 'may, at its sole discretion, provide,' making the first offer optional. This creates a contradiction regarding the obligation to provide the right of first offer, undermining enforceability.",

Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",

Any required notice shall be effective two business days or immediately after it is sent by a recognized international courier service or personal delivery to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice, although oral notices have no required proof.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that all notices must be in writing. The modified version introduces the possibility of oral notices, directly contradicting the written requirement. It is also uncertain when the effect date is.

The changed text now allows for amendments via 'mutual verbal agreement documented via email confirmation,' creating a contradiction. This introduces ambiguity as to the valid methods of amending the contract, specifically whether a formal 'instrument in writing' is always necessary or if email documented verbal agreements suffice, making enforceability uncertain.",

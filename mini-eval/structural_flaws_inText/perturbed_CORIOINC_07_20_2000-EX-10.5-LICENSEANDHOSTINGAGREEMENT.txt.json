This license is granted for the term of this agreement only, with no guarantee of renewal or extension.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the license is 'perpetual and irrevocable', creating a strong expectation of long-term rights. The modified text removes 'perpetual and irrevocable' and adds 'This license is granted for the term of this agreement only, with no guarantee of renewal or extension.' This directly contradicts the original implication, creating uncertainty about the duration of the license and the rights of Corio.",

Corio shall be responsible for providing its Customers with routine technical support of the Software and MarketSite.net Service. Corio shall escalate any technical support questions or problems it is unable to answer or resolve directly to Commerce One for Commerce One's immediate attention and resolution under the schedule set forth in EXHIBIT C hereto. The support described in this Section 5.3 and EXHIBIT C hereto shall be provided to Corio but Commerce One shall have no obligation to provide any maintenance or support services to other third parties. Subject to Corio's payment of the annual support and maintenance fee, Commerce One's support and maintenance obligation of the Software and MarketSite.net Service shall continue after termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to all Software Users granted access to the Software and MarketSite.net Service prior to termination or expiration of this Agreement.",

Continued support is subject to Commerce One's sole discretion and a separate agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Commerce One's support continues after termination as long as Corio pays. The modified version directly contradicts this, stating support ceases upon termination. This creates confusion about the post-termination support obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear link between the license and the fixed fees in Exhibit B. By adding 'All fees are subject to change at Commerce One's discretion with 30 days written notice,' we create a contradiction. This allows Commerce One to unilaterally alter the fees, undermining the expectation of fixed costs based on the original agreement and EXHIBIT B.",

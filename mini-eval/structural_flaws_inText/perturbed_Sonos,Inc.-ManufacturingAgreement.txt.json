                "original_text": "1.49. \"Sonos Sourced Component(s)\" means all Third Party Components required for the manufacture of Products that the pricing and supply contract, including all terms and conditions, are negotiated and controlled by Sonos. IAC shall procure Sonos Sourced Components at the pricing, terms and conditions as directed by Sonos, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Parties. Sonos Sourced Components are listed in the attached Statement of Works, and may be updated from time to time in writing by Sonos to IAC.",
                "changed_text": "1.49. \"Sonos Sourced Component(s)\" means certain components that Sonos prefers to source directly, however IAC retains the ultimate discretion and control over the pricing and supply contract, including all terms and conditions, for all Third Party Components required for the manufacture of Products. IAC may procure Sonos Sourced Components at pricing, terms and conditions it deems fit, notifying Sonos for informational purposes only. Sonos Sourced Components are listed in the attached Statement of Works, but such listing is not binding and can be disregarded by IAC at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Sonos controls the pricing and terms for Sonos Sourced Components, and IAC must procure them as directed by Sonos. The modified text directly contradicts this by giving IAC control over pricing and terms, essentially negating Sonos's control and creating uncertainty about who is responsible for component costs and supply.",

This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional successive one (1) year periods, unless written notice of non-renewal is received no later than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the then current term.",

This Agreement will be automatically renewed unless either party objects to the renewal at any point, after which the contract ends with immediate effect.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates automatic renewal unless a written notice of non-renewal is received six months before expiration. The modified clause contradicts this by stating that the agreement ends immediately upon either party objecting, regardless of any prior notice or the six-month window. This creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration and the renewal process.",

This addition directly undermines and contradicts the original warranty by rendering it unenforceable at IAC's whim.",

                "original_text": "Base Servicing Fee Rate: As to any Mortgage Loan, the per annum rate specified to be payable to Freedom Mortgage to cover the actual costs of servicing. For example, the Base Servicing Fee Rate for the Mortgage Loans in the initial pool will be eight (8) basis points.",
                "changed_text": "Base Servicing Fee Rate: As to any Mortgage Loan, the per annum rate may or may not be payable to Freedom Mortgage, subject to Cherry Hill's discretion, to cover the actual costs of servicing. For example, the Base Servicing Fee Rate for the Mortgage Loans in the initial pool may or may not be eight (8) basis points.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Base Servicing Fee Rate will be eight basis points. The modified version removes this certainty by adding \"may or may not be payable,\" creating ambiguity about the payment terms and contradicting the initial definition.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cherry Hill retains the right to terminate this agreement at any time, with or without cause, upon providing 30 days written notice to Freedom Mortgage.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the specific conditions for the agreement's term. The addition of \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cherry Hill retains the right to terminate this agreement at any time, with or without cause...\" contradicts the term defined in the previous sentence. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement and gives Cherry Hill unilateral termination rights, conflicting with the initial term clause.",

However, Cherry Hill reserves the right to unilaterally modify certain non-material aspects of this agreement upon providing written notice to Freedom Mortgage. Such aspects will be subject to Cherry Hill's definition.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that all amendments require a written agreement signed by both parties. The added sentence, \"However, Cherry Hill reserves the right to unilaterally modify certain non-material aspects of this agreement upon providing written notice to Freedom Mortgage,\" directly contradicts this, granting Cherry Hill the ability to make changes without Freedom Mortgage's explicit consent for 'non-material' aspects, subject to Cherry Hill's definition of that term. This creates ambiguity about the amendment process and could lead to disputes over what constitutes a 'non-material' change.",

If the Agreement expired prior to the Amendment Effective Date, any orders received and Products and Services purchased between the date of expiration and the Amendment Effective Date shall be in all respects deemed made under the Agreement as in effect prior to this Amendment. The parties further agree that if Distributor places Purchase Orders after the expiration of the Agreement, and Cisco accepts such Purchase Orders, then any such Purchase Orders shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement; provided, however that acceptance by Cisco of any Purchase Order placed after the Agreement has expired will not be considered as an extension of the term of the Agreement nor a renewal thereof. Notwithstanding Cisco's right to extend the term of the Agreement, each party acknowledges that the Agreement shall always be interpreted as being limited in duration to a definite term and that the other party has made no commitments whatsoever regarding the renewal of the Agreement beyond those expressly agreed in writing.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that acceptance of purchase orders after the agreement's expiration will not be considered an extension. The modified text now states that it WILL be considered an automatic extension. This directly contradicts the original statement, creating uncertainty about the agreement's term and renewal process, making it an in-text contradiction.",

The above-referenced cap shall be determined based on all Product purchases made under this Agreement. The responsibility to manage the Balancing Cap shall rest solely upon Distributor. Distributor shall be entitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\" and Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from calculation of the Balancing Cap. Cisco shall credit Distributor's account in the amount of the price paid by Distributor therefore, less any price protection credits issued to Distributor related to the Product returned (the \"Return Credit\").",
                "changed_text": "Distributor may, at Cisco's sole discretion, return to Cisco, for credit, up [*****] of the dollar value of Products from the Wholesale Price List (or, if no Wholesale Price Lists exists for Distributor's Territory, then the applicable price list) shipped to Distributor, net of credits, less returns to Cisco, in the preceding [*****] period (the \"Balancing Cap\") of the preceding Cisco fiscal quarter.

Distributor shall be entitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\" and Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be included in the calculation of the Balancing Cap. Cisco will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether to credit Distributor's account for returned products. Any credit, if applicable, will be less any price protection credits issued to Distributor related to the Product returned (the \"Return Credit\").",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the distributor the option to return products for credit with specific exclusions. The modified text introduces Cisco's discretion in allowing returns and determining the credit amount, removes the prior exclusions for returns calculation, and also removes the mandatory aspect of issuing credits by saying Cisco will determine on a case-by-case basis, directly contradicting the distributor's previously established right and introducing uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for immediate termination by Cisco if the Distributor breaches any representation. The modified text introduces a 30-day cure period, unless Cisco determines it is a material breach. This directly contradicts the immediate termination right stated previously, as a cure period now exists, making the original immediate termination right uncertain.",

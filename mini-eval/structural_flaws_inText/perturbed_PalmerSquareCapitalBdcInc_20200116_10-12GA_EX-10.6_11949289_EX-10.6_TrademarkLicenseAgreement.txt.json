                "original_text": "1.1. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely and exclusively as a component of Licensee's own corporate name and in connection with marketing the investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services that Investment Advisor may provide to Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this License, and except as provided above, neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory without the prior express written consent of Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion and shall not use the Licensed Mark for any purpose outside the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts from Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark solely as a component of Licensee's own corporate name and in connection with the general operation of Licensee's business. During the term of this Agreement, Licensee may use the Licensed Mark to the extent that it deems appropriate, and neither Licensee nor any affiliate, owner, director, officer, employee or agent thereof requires the prior express written consent of Licensor to use the Licensed Mark or any derivative thereof in the Territory. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the Licensee a specific, limited license to use the Licensed Mark. The changed text broadens the scope of the license, allowing for use in 'the general operation of Licensee's business' and removes the requirement for prior written consent. This directly contradicts the initial limited grant, creating uncertainty about the scope of permitted use and enforcement.",

This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee's rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be perpetually valid and automatically renews, regardless of the Investment Advisor's status. Termination is only possible upon mutual written agreement by both Licensor and Licensee. No other conditions, including Third Party Claims or assignment attempts, shall warrant termination of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines specific conditions under which the Trademark License Agreement can be terminated, including the Investment Advisor ceasing to serve, a Third Party Claim, or assignment without consent. The modified version completely negates these conditions by stating that the agreement is perpetual, only terminable by mutual agreement, and that no other condition warrants termination. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the circumstances under which the agreement can be terminated, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "original_text": "Section 4.1. Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues in perpetuity, unless termination occurs pursuant to Sections 4.2 through 4.4.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.1. Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for a period of one year, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms, unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this renewal is subject to Licensor's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement continues 'in perpetuity,' while the modified text introduces a one-year term with automatic renewal, creating a direct contradiction. The perpetual term implies no need for renewal, while the modified term necessitates periodic renewal. The final addition of 'subject to Licensor's sole discretion' further complicates the agreement. Does the automatic renewal take effect, or is it a conditional renewal? These changes create uncertainty in enforcement.",

Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non- transferable, and (subject to Section 1.2 hereof) non-sublicensable license for the use of the Brand solely for the Permitted Activity.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.1. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive license for the use of the Brand solely for the Permitted Activity. However, the Licensor reserves the right to transfer the license to another party at any time, at its sole discretion, without prior notice to the Licensee. The Licensee may not sublicense the license unless given written consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the license is 'non-transferable' and 'non-sublicensable'. The modified text states the licensor can transfer the license to another party, creating a direct contradiction to the non-transferable term. This introduces uncertainty as it's unclear whether the Licensee actually has secure rights or whether those rights can be withdrawn at any time. The restriction of sublicense, while originally stated, now requires written consent. This clause may still be enforceable in some cases.",

However, Licensor reserves the right to unilaterally amend the definition of 'Permitted Activity' upon 30 days written notice to Licensee. All other amendments require mutual written agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires mutual written agreement for all amendments. The modified clause introduces an exception, allowing the Licensor to unilaterally amend the definition of 'Permitted Activity'. This creates a contradiction: the first sentence requires mutual agreement, while the second allows for unilateral change by one party. This undermines the bilateral amendment process described in the first sentence and creates uncertainty about the extent to which the agreement is truly mutually binding.",

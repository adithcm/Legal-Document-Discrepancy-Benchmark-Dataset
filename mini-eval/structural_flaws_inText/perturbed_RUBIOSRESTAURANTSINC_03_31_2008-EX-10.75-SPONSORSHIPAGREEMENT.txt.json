                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original hierarchy, where the General Provisions always took precedence. Now, the Agreement Summary prevails unless the General Provisions explicitly state otherwise, creating uncertainty about which section controls in case of a conflict.",

However, SDBF's indemnification obligations shall be capped at $10,000 per incident.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states SDBF will indemnify Sponsor for any claims arising from SDBF's negligence or willful misconduct. The modification changes \"negligence\" to \"gross negligence\" which requires a higher degree of fault to trigger indemnification, which makes it more challenging for the Sponsor to be fully protected, but then contradicts by adding a cap of $10,000 per incident. The original text promised full indemnification, meaning no limit on the amount for costs or expenses arising from a claim; the edited statement now places a limit on the amount they will protect the Sponsor from.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may freely assign this agreement to any entity that acquires all or substantially all of its assets. However, such assignment shall not relieve the assigning party of its obligations under this Agreement unless the other party provides written consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies conditions under which assignment is permitted without prior approval, outlining certain entities and maintaining Sponsor's obligations. The modified text first restates the original provision, then creates a carve-out allowing for free assignment upon acquisition of assets, but then contradicts this by stating the assigning party remains obligated unless written consent is obtained. This introduces uncertainty about when assignment is truly permissible and whether the assigning party is relieved of its obligations, causing uncertainty about the obligations and rights of each party.",

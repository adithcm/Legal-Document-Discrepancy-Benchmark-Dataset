                "original_text": "Section 7. Term of Agreement; Resignation and Removal of Servicer.\n\n(a) This Agreement shall continue in force until the earlier to occur of (i) the Owner no longer owns any Receivables or Participation Interests, and (ii) subject to Section 7(d), the delivery of written notice of termination by the Owner to the Servicer pursuant to Section 7(c), in each case upon which event this Agreement shall automatically terminate unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Servicer and the Owner.",
                "changed_text": "Section 7. Term of Agreement; Resignation and Removal of Servicer.\n\n(a) This Agreement shall continue in force indefinitely unless terminated by mutual written agreement of the Owner and the Servicer. This Agreement may also be terminated unilaterally by either the Owner or the Servicer at any time, with or without cause, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party. The requirement for mutual agreement to terminate found elsewhere in this contract shall be of no effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic termination under certain conditions (no receivables or termination notice). The modified version introduces the possibility of indefinite continuation unless terminated by mutual agreement but also allows unilateral termination with 30 days' notice. This contradicts the 'automatic termination' clause and introduces uncertainty, making it unclear when the agreement ends. It nullifies other mentions in this contract that might dictate requirements for termination.",

Limitation of Liability; Indemnification.\n\n(a) Except as provided in Section 13(b), neither the Servicer nor any of the directors, officers, partners, members, managers, employees, or agents of the Servicer in its capacity as Servicer shall be under any liability to the Owner or any other Person for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in good faith in its capacity as Servicer in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer or any such Person against contractual liability under this Agreement for any breach of warranties or representations made herein, or any failure to perform any express contractual duties set forth herein, or any liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "Section 13. Limitation of Liability; Indemnification.\n\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Servicer shall have unlimited liability to the Owner for any actions taken or refrained from being taken in its capacity as Servicer, regardless of good faith or compliance with this Agreement. The Servicer shall be fully liable for all direct and indirect damages, including consequential damages, arising from its performance or non-performance under this agreement. Any limitations of liability stated elsewhere in this contract shall be rendered of no effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits the Servicer's liability for actions taken in good faith. The modified text removes this limitation and imposes unlimited liability for any action or inaction, even if in good faith. This directly contradicts the original intent to protect the Servicer from liability for good-faith actions, creating uncertainty about the scope of the Servicer's potential financial exposure and intentionally overrides other liability limitations stated elsewhere in the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Section 4. Independence of the Servicer. For all purposes of this Agreement, the Servicer shall be an independent contractor and shall not be subject to the supervision of the Owner with respect to the manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, Servicer shall be subject to the Owner's third-party vendor management program. Unless expressly authorized by the Owner in this Agreement or otherwise, the Servicer shall have no authority to act for or represent the Owner in any way and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Owner.",

For all purposes of this Agreement, the Servicer shall act as a direct agent of the Owner and shall be subject to the complete and absolute supervision of the Owner with respect to all aspects of the performance of its obligations hereunder. The Servicer is hereby granted full and complete authority to act for and represent the Owner in any and all matters related to the Serviced Assets. Any mentions in this contract about the Servicer being an independent contractor shall be rendered of no effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states the Servicer is an independent contractor not subject to the Owner's supervision. The modified text completely reverses this, designating the Servicer as a direct agent subject to the Owner's absolute supervision and granting them full authority to represent the Owner. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the Servicer's status and authority, which could significantly impact the allocation of responsibility and liability and overrides the independent contractor status established throughout the agreement.",

A person or entity shall be regarded as in control of another entity if it owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding equity securities of the subject entity which is entitled to vote in the election of directors, or a fifty percent (50%) or greater interest in the net assets or profits of the subject entity if such entity is not a corporation.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Achaogen Know-How\" specifies that it relates *directly* to Plazomicin. The modified definition broadens this scope to include other Achaogen products or research, contradicting the initial, more specific definition. This creates uncertainty regarding the scope of know-how Microgenics is licensed to use, potentially affecting the commercialization of the Assay.",

Solely to the extent Achaogen elects to promote an assay which may be capable of measuring Plazomicin in a given Primary Country ([***]) in the Territory, and subject to receipt and conditions of any applicable Regulatory Approvals, Achaogen shall prioritize the promotion of the Assay relative to any other assay which may be capable of measuring Plazomicin, in its marketing and sales efforts in such Primary Country; provided, however, that in the event (a) Microgenics [***] is unable to supply the Assay in quantities sufficient to meet each applicable Binding Forecast, including [***], or (b) [***], Achaogen may prioritize the promotion of assays capable of measuring Plazomicin in the affected country(ies). For clarity, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including this Section 4.2, Achaogen expressly reserves and retains the right to, directly or indirectly (including through contractors or collaborators), research, develop, manufacture, use or commercialize assays capable of measuring Plazomicin other than the Assay; provided, that, Achaogen may not, directly or indirectly (including through contractors or collaborators) commercialize any immunoassay [***], other than the Assay in accordance herewith, [***]; provided, further, that the restriction on Achaogen's right to commercialize immunoassays [***], other than the Assay, shall be of no force or effect if Microgenics is unable to supply the Assay for [***] ([***]) days at any time [***] or if the Parties mutually determine that Microgenics will not be able to supply the Assay.

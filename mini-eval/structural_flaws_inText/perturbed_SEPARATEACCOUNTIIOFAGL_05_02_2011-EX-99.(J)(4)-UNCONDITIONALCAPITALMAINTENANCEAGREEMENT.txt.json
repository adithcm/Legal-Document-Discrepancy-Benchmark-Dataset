                "explanation": "Originally, the text states that AIG 'shall have the absolute right' to terminate, but with specific conditions that must be met for termination. Changing 'shall have' to 'may have' makes the right to terminate discretionary. However, the conditions for termination remain, implying that under certain circumstances, AIG *must* not terminate.

The salary (and so far, as is reasonably possible) the benefits allowance will accrue from day to day and be payable in equal instalments in arrears on or around the 25th day of every month, less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions and shall be inclusive of any fees receivable by the Executive as a director of any Group Company.",

The salary (and so far, as is reasonably possible) the benefits allowance will accrue from day to day and be payable in equal instalments in arrears on or around the 25th day of every month, less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions and shall be inclusive of any fees receivable by the Executive as a director of any Group Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a fixed annual salary of £740,000. The changed text introduces uncertainty by stating that the salary amount will be determined yearly based on the employee's performance. This contradicts the fixed amount defined in the original agreement and could create dispute about the actual salary the executive is entitled to.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that either party should provide 12 months written notice of termination, where as the changed text stipulates only 3 months notice is required. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the amount of notice that must be given when either party decides to terminate the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the executive is entitled to 25 days paid holiday per year, and no accrued holiday can be carried over. The modified text reduces the holiday entitlement to 15 days and allows up to 5 days of accrued holiday to be carried over. This directly contradicts the original terms and could lead to disputes about the executive's holiday entitlement and carryover policy.",

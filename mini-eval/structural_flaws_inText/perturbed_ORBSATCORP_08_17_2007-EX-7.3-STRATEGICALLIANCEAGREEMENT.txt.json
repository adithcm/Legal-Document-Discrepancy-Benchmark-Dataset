                "explanation": "The original text states that either party can terminate with 30 days' notice. The changed text introduces a contradiction by requiring mutual written consent for termination, essentially negating the 'at any time' clause and creating uncertainty about the termination conditions.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, UTK is permitted to share confidential information with potential investors and partners for the purpose of securing funding or strategic alliances, even if such entities might be considered competitors of AVDU.

                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits UTK from divulging confidential information. The modified text introduces an exception, allowing UTK to share confidential information with potential investors and partners, even if they are competitors. This directly contradicts the initial prohibition and creates uncertainty about the scope of confidentiality.",

UTEK may solicit employees of AVDU, but shall only do so with the consent of said employees.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a mutual agreement not to solicit employees. The modification maintains the restriction on AVDU, but removes it for UTK, allowing UTK to solicit AVDU employees as long as the employees consent. This creates an imbalance and a contradiction in the non-solicitation agreement.",

ISO shall also be responsible for ensuring all Merchant Reserve Accounts are adequately funded. All Merchant Reserve Accounts, along with any other monies or collateral collected from Approved Merchants, shall be deposited with Bank.",

SERVICERS shall not be responsible for ensuring all Merchant Reserve Accounts are adequately funded. All Merchant Reserve Accounts, along with any other monies or collateral collected from Approved Merchants, shall be deposited with Bank.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces contradiction by assigning the determination of Merchant Reserve Account amounts to SERVICERS, while simultaneously stating they are NOT responsible for ensuring these accounts are adequately funded, even though the responsibility for determining the correct amount implies that the responsible party should make sure that amount is available.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that SERVICERS' approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The modified text contradicts this by saying the approval may be withheld or delayed at SERVICERS' sole discretion. This introduces uncertainty as to whether ISO can reliably use SERVICERS' marks, impacting its marketing efforts.",

                "explanation": "This creates ambiguity and internal conflict. The original states unequivocally that ISO is responsible for all credit and fraud losses. The modified version creates ambiguity as to who is responsible, as 'may assume' implies that SERVICERS can take the responsability of that. It contradicts ISO being responsible.",

CytoDyn shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its entirety upon written notice to Vyera on the occurrence of any of the following: (a) Vyera or any of its Affiliates directly or indirectly, challenges, disputes, or assists any Third Party to dispute or challenge, in a legal or administrative proceeding the patentability, enforceability or validity of any CytoDyn Patents; (b) Vyera fails to make a First Commercial Sale within sixty (60) days following the later of (i) the date Regulatory Approval is obtained and (ii) the date CytoDyn supplies (or is ready to supply) Vyera with the Licensed Product for sale pursuant to the Supply Agreement (the \"Supply Date\"); (c) Vyera breaches its obligations or covenants under Section 2.6 (Competitive Products); (d) Upon [***] written notice, in the event Vyera fails to meet any of the Minimum Requirements and has not cured such failure, to the extent curable, within such notice period; or (e) Vyera fails to make the Equity Investment within seven (7) days of the Effective Date, as required by Section 8.13.",

                "explanation": "By adding \"but CytoDyn is not obligated to terminate the agreement if such challenge occurs\" to Section 11.3(a), we create a contradiction. The original clause states CytoDyn 'shall have the right to terminate' if Vyera challenges the patents, implying a guaranteed right. The added text introduces discretion, making it unclear if CytoDyn will actually terminate the agreement, even if the specified condition is met. This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This modifies Section 8.6 to contradict the nature of the license after the Royalty Term. Originally, it states the license becomes 'non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid and royalty-free.' By changing this to 'non-exclusive, but CytoDyn reserves the right to renegotiate royalty terms with Vyera,' we remove the 'perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid and royalty-free' aspect and create uncertainty. Now, Vyera faces the possibility of having to renegotiate royalty terms even after the Royalty Term, undermining the seemingly permanent nature of the post-Royalty Term license.",

                "explanation": "The additional context 'unless CytoDyn permits Vyera to disclose Confidential Information' has contradicted with the main point of Section 10.1. Initially, Section 10.1 emphasizes on the Nondisclosure of the Confidential Information during the Term and after 10 years. The phrase has been changed so that CytoDyn has the discretion to permit Vyera to disclose the Information and it could happen any time during the agreement period.",

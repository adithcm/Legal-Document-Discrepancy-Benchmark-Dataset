Unless this Agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of Section ​12, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until July 31, 2019 (the \"Initial Term\"). Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms of six (6) months (each a \"Renewal Term\", and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\") unless written notice is given by either Party no later than thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term.",

Unless this Agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of Section ​12, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until July 31, 2019 (the \"Initial Term\"). Following the Initial Term, this Agreement may be renewed at the sole discretion of XSPA for successive terms of six (6) months (each a \"Renewal Term\", and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\").",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the contract auto-renews unless either party gives written notice. The modified text says renewal is at XSPA's 'sole discretion', contradicting the auto-renewal clause and creating uncertainty about the actual renewal process.",

XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such commission be greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",

XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; XSPA has the right to change the percentages at their own descretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states XSPA pays Calm 50% of the Retail Price minus commissions. Modifying the end of the clause to say, “XSPA has the right to change the percentages at their own discretion.” This contradicts the previous rate structure and introduces ambiguity regarding payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that liability is capped at $2,000,000. Modifying this to say that each party can set the liability cap at 'an amount each party deems suitable' creates a contradiction. This makes it unclear whether the $2,000,000 limit stands or if each party can unilaterally decide a different amount, undermining the certainty intended by a liability cap.",

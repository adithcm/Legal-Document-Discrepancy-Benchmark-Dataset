                "changed_text": "9.1  In accordance with items 9.3, 9.4, and 10.3, this Contract shall come into\nforce on the Effective Date, remain effective throughout the Initial Term,\nand may be prolonged or further extended for a period determined at the discretion of the Company, each such extension commencing at the end of the last day of the Initial Term or the relevant anniversary thereof, unless either Party serves written notice of termination on the other Party at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term, or any subsequent extension. In the event of a disagreement regarding the extension, the Company's decision will be final.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the contract is automatically extended unless either party provides notice. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the extension period is at 'the discretion of the Company' and that 'the Company's decision will be final,' which contradicts the initial automatic extension clause, causing uncertainty about the renewal terms. Also, the notice period has been reduced to 30 days, which can be confusing.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed fee of $1.00. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the fee will be 'determined by the Company,' removing the fixed amount and giving the Company unilateral control over the pricing. The original text has a fixed time frame for when payments should be made. The modified text changes this by giving the company the power to decide the time frame after the delivery date, taking away from the Principal.",

The modified text adds an exception, allowing the Company to assign to its affiliates without the Principal's consent, thus contradicting the initial requirement of mutual consent.

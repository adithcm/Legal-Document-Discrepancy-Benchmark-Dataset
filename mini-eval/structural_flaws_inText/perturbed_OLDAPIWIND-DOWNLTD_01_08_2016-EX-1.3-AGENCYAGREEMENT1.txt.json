As additional consideration, the Corporation shall issue to the Agents that number of compensation options (the \"Compensation Options\") equal to 3.5% of the number of Offered Shares sold pursuant to the Offering.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the Agents' services to be rendered in connection with the Offering, the Corporation may pay to the Agents a cash fee (the \"Agents' Fee\") not to exceed 7.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. As additional consideration, the Corporation may issue to the Agents compensation options (the \"Compensation Options\") not to exceed 3.5% of the number of Offered Shares sold pursuant to the Offering.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'the Corporation shall pay', making the fee mandatory. The changed text introduces uncertainty by stating 'the Corporation may pay,' making it discretionary. The original text clearly defined the Agentsâ€™ Fee as equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. However, the revised text introduced contradiction through flexibility by saying 'not to exceed 7.0%'. This creates uncertainty regarding payment terms.",

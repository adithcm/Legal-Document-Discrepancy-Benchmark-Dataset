                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason. Expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not limit any obligations of a party that were incurred prior to such expiration or termination.",
                "changed_text": "Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason with 30 days written notice. However, Imprimis shall have the sole right to terminate this agreement if Surgical does not meet the sales target as defined in the SOW. Expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not limit any obligations of a party that were incurred prior to such expiration or termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants both parties the right to terminate the agreement 'at any time for any reason.' The modified text introduces a contradictory condition where Imprimis has 'sole right' to terminate based on Surgical's sales performance. This creates uncertainty about the grounds for termination and the rights of each party, creating a structural flaw.",

                "changed_text": "Surgical shall not promote, market, or sell any products for any third party during the Term, which directly or indirectly compete with the Product, unless Imprimis provides written consent, which Imprimis can revoke without any prior notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear prohibition on Surgical promoting competing products. The modification introduces an exception contingent on Imprimis' consent, but then undermines this by allowing Imprimis to revoke consent 'without any prior notice'. This creates an in-text contradiction: Surgical is prohibited from competing, but can compete with Imprimis approval, yet that approval can be instantly withdrawn. This creates uncertainty and potential for dispute.",

                "original_text": "Sales Commissions. During the Term of the Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Imprimis shall pay to Surgical Sales Commissions equal to ten percent (10%) of the Net Sales for Product.",
                "changed_text": "Sales Commissions. During the Term of the Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Imprimis may pay to Surgical Sales Commissions with amount to be decided by the Imprimis finance department. Imprimis can modify the commission percentage at any time without needing Surgical's approval",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Surgical shall receive a 10% commission. The modified version introduces uncertainty by saying Imprimis 'may pay' commissions and the amount is 'to be decided', directly contradicting the prior fixed percentage. The text also indicates the commission percentage can be changed at anytime without approval, this directly contradicts the 10% as stated earlier.",

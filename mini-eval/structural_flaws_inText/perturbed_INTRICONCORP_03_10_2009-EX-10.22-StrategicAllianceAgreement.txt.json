                "original_text": "Term: The initial term of this Agreement shall be five (5) years from the date of execution and may be extended subject to satisfactory  agreement on ongoing commercial terms, to be agreed two (2) months prior to the expiration of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Term: The initial term of this Agreement shall be five (5) years from the date of execution. IntriCon, at its sole discretion, may extend this agreement for any period it deems appropriate, without needing Dynamic Hearing’s consent.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause by stating that the agreement may be extended at IntriCon's sole discretion, removing the requirement for mutual agreement on commercial terms. This creates uncertainty about the renewal process and Dynamic Hearing’s rights.",

                "changed_text": "Dynamic Hearing agrees that it will not license any Dynamic Hearing Technology for Hearing Aids, subject to Clause 3.5. However, Dynamic Hearing reserves the right to license its Dynamic Hearing Technology for Hearing Aids to any new customers it deems strategically important.",
                "explanation": "The additional sentence introduces an exception to the non-licensing agreement based on 'strategic importance'. This contradicts the initial restriction and creates ambiguity about Dynamic Hearing’s obligations, making it unclear when the exclusivity actually applies and undermines the exclusivity provided to IntriCon in 3.4",

Likewise, Dynamic Hearing may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of IntriCon.",
                "changed_text": "IntriCon may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of  Dynamic Hearing. Dynamic Hearing may freely assign its rights and obligations under this agreement to any related body corporate without requiring IntriCon's consent.",
                "explanation": "By allowing Dynamic Hearing to freely assign its rights to a related body corporate while IntriCon still requires consent, it creates an imbalance.  This directly contradicts the initial statement that both parties require mutual consent for assignment, introducing uncertainty and potentially disadvantaging IntriCon.",

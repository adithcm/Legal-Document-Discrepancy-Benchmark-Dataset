EKR  shall provide PPI with a copy of any original certificates of approval/registration in each country in the Territory other than the United  States. EKR shall provide PPI with a copy of any other registration matters received from the appropriate Regulatory Authorities  concerning maintenance, renewal or variations to the original certificates of approval/registration in each country in the Territory. Except as  provided in Section 3.17, EKR shall be solely responsible for, and shall bear all costs associated with, all regulatory activities related to the  development and approval of the Product in the countries of the Territory (including, after the Agreement Date, the United States) and shall  own the Marketing Authorizations for the Product in each other country of the Territory.

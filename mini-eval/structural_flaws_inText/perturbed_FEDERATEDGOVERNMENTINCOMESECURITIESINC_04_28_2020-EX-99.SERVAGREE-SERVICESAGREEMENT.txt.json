                "original_text": "5. Duration and Termination.\n\n(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the effective date first above written and shall continue until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or by either party on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party hereto.",
                "changed_text": "5. Duration and Termination.\n\n(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the effective date first above written and shall continue indefinitely, unless either party provides 10 days' written notice to the other party hereto.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the agreement continues until terminated by mutual agreement or 60 days' written notice. The modified version states the agreement continues indefinitely unless 10 days' notice is given. This directly contradicts the original termination conditions, creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration and termination process.",

This Agreement may be amended at any time by mutual written agreement of the parties hereto; provided, however, that no Amendment to this Agreement shall be effective with respect to any investment advisory services to be provided to any Account which is registered investment company unless, to the extent required by Section 15(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, such amendment has been approved both by the vote of a majority of the Board of the Account, including a majority of the members of the Board who are not parties to this Agreement or interested persons of any such party (other than as members of the Board), cast in person at a meeting called for that purpose and, where required by Section 15(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, on behalf of the Account by a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such Account as defined in Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act.",
                "changed_text": "6. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended unilaterally by either party with 30 days written notice. Amendments related to investment advisory services for registered investment companies do not require any board or shareholder approval.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires mutual written agreement and, for registered investment companies, specific board and shareholder approval for amendments. The modified clause allows unilateral amendment with simple written notice and explicitly removes the approval requirement for investment advisory services. This is a direct contradiction regarding the process for amending the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for the Adviser to pay fees calculated according to Exhibit B. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that payment is at the Adviser's sole discretion, effectively negating the fee calculation method defined in Exhibit B and creating ambiguity around the payment obligations. This could cause disputes over payments for services.",

Astellas and its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall not directly or indirectly make, produce or manufacture any Lead Compounds.",
                "changed_text": "12.2 FG Right. FG shall have the worldwide exclusive right (itself or through third party vendors) to manufacture (or have manufactured) Lead Compounds. Astellas and its Affiliates and Sublicensees may, under exceptional circumstances and with FG's prior written approval, directly or indirectly make, produce or manufacture Lead Compounds. Such approval will be granted at FG's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. The original stated that Astellas 'shall not' manufacture Lead Compounds, while the revised version allows them to do so with FG's approval, creating uncertainty about Astellas' manufacturing rights.",

Subject to Section 18.7.2, Astellas may terminate this Agreement upon six (6) months notice to FG for any reason, provided that such termination does not negatively impact ongoing clinical trials. If termination negatively impacts ongoing clinical trials, Astellas must continue the trials until completion, even beyond the six-month notice period.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows Astellas to terminate 'for any reason,' implying no restrictions. The modified version adds a condition related to ongoing clinical trials, creating a potential contradiction. The original is unconditional, while the modified version adds a restriction.",

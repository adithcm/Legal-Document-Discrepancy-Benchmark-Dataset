The changed text states that the license is not revoked upon termination and still in effect for 1 year, creating a contradiction. Also, by enabling PlanetCAD to revoke at any time, the original statement that it is only revoked upon termination is now contradicted.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear apportionment of net revenue based on who is hosting the service. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'the net revenue will be split at the discretion of the billing party', contradicting the previously defined percentages and creating uncertainty about how revenue will be shared. The first section states that PlanetCAD will have more revenue when it is the billing party but the modified text says PlanetCAD will have more revenue then Dassault System, contradicting.",

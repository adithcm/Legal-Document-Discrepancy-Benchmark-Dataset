The occurrence of any one or more of the following acts, events or occurrences shall constitute an \"Event of Default\" under this Agreement: (a) either party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy or is subjected to involuntary bankruptcy proceedings that are not dismissed within 60 days, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (b) either party breaches any material provision of this Agreement and the result is the non-breaching party experiencing a substantial deprivation of the benefits to which the non-breaching party is entitled under this Agreement, which material breach is not cured by the breaching party within 30 days after the breaching party's receipt of the non-breaching party's written notice specifying the breach in detail; provided, however, that if the breach is of such a nature that it may be cured, but it may not reasonably be cured within such 30-day period, the non-breaching party may not terminate this Agreement unless such breach is not cured by the breaching party on or before the 60th day after the breaching party's receipt of the non-breaching party's notice of breach if breaching party has commenced substantial efforts to cure the breach within the initial 30-day period and has continued in good faith to work to cure the breach as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, or (c) Converge fails to pay when due any amounts payable under Section 4 and fails to cure such breach within 3 Business Days after VNE gives Converge written notice specifying the breach.",

The occurrence of any one or more of the following acts, events or occurrences may constitute an \"Event of Default\" under this Agreement at the discretion of the non-breaching party: (a) either party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy or is subjected to involuntary bankruptcy proceedings that are not dismissed within 60 days, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (b) either party breaches any material provision of this Agreement, however, whether this constitutes an event of default will be determined solely by VNE, in its absolute discretion, considering the totality of circumstances; or (c) Converge fails to pay when due any amounts payable under Section 4 and fails to cure such breach within 3 Business Days after VNE gives Converge written notice specifying the breach. VNE reserves the right to waive any Event of Default.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines specific events that 'shall constitute' an Event of Default. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that these events 'may constitute' an Event of Default 'at the discretion of the non-breaching party.' Furthermore, it gives VNE the sole power to decide whether any breach is a default, creating a contradiction. This contradiction creates uncertainty about when a breach actually leads to consequences.",

The modified version introduces 'estimated' to describe the fee. In addition, it introduces the clause 'may pay'. Furthermore, it adds the phrase 'unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties', making the payment obligation conditional and therefore, contradicting the previous sentence",

A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than breach of this agreement.",

A six (6) months notice must be given by either party of their intention to terminate relations due to any reason other than breach of this agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text restricts both parties, while the modified text changes the restriction for the customer only, and states 'The Customer may freely transfer or assign its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of the Manufacturer.', which gives the customer rights to freely transfer the agreement without consent, while the Manufacture still needs consent. This is a clear contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the software license and maintenance are provided at no charge. The modified version introduces uncertainty by adding that the supplier reserves the right to impose a license fee, contradicting the initial statement. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual cost of the software license and maintenance.",

Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled \"Termination\" of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without paying any reinstatement fee.",

Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services, but the supplier reserves the right to impose reinstatement fees to cover administrative costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Maintenance Term automatically renews unless Bank of America terminates. The changed version states the maintenance term shall renew based on mutual agreement, contradicting the automatic renewal clause. Additionally, the reinstatement fee clause is altered, initially waiving the reinstatement fee upon BofA termination and reinstating the fee after termination in the modified version. These changes undermine the certainty of the maintenance agreement.",

                "changed_text": "The Maintenance Period will generally be twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week. However, the supplier is not required to maintain such uptime during any national holiday and may also have downtimes for scheduled maintenance windows.",
                "explanation": "The original text definitively states that the maintenance period is 24/7 including holidays. The changed text introduces exceptions, stating that the supplier is not required to maintain such uptime during national holidays and also specifies downtimes for scheduled maintenance. This contradicts the original unqualified statement and creates uncertainty about the guaranteed level of maintenance support.",

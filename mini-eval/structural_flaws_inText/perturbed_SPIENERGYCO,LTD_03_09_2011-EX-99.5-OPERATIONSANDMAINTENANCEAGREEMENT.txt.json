                "explanation": "The original text specified that Service Provider's employees must be qualified and meet certain standards, and the Owner/User has the right to request the removal of unqualified personnel. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that employees *may or may not* be qualified and that the Owner/User *may not* request removal. This creates a direct contradiction, as the original text mandates certain personnel standards, while the modified text allows for a deviation from those standards. This could lead to disputes over personnel qualifications and the Owner/User's ability to ensure competent service.",

                "explanation": "The original clause definitively states the payment terms: Owner *shall* pay within 30 days, fees *are* conditioned upon timely payment, and interest *will* accrue on late payments. The modified clause uses the phrases \"may or may not\" to introduce uncertainty. It's now unclear if the owner is obligated to pay within the given timeframe or if interests will be enforced, creating significant ambiguity and contradicts the original clause's intention to clearly define payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change severely weakens the force majeure clause. Originally, it stated that parties *shall* not be liable for failures due to force majeure events and *shall* be entitled to equitable adjustments. The modified version introduces uncertainty and contradicts that by saying parties *may or may not* be excused, and *may or may not* include force majeure events. The obligations for each party are non binding anymore. This shift introduces significant risk and uncertainty regarding how force majeure events will be handled, creating a direct conflict with the original intent of the clause.",

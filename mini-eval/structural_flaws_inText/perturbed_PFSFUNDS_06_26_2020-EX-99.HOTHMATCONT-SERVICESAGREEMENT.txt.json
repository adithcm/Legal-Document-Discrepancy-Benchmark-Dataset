Except as set forth below, the Adviser will pay all operating expenses of each Fund specifically assumed by the Fund under the Management Agreement between the Trust and the Adviser dated June 24, 2020 (the \"Management Agreement\"), including without limitation the compensation and expenses of any employees of the Fund and of any other persons rendering any services to the Fund; clerical and shareholder service staff salaries; office space and other office expenses; fees and expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with membership in investment company organizations; legal, auditing and accounting expenses; expenses of registering shares under federal and state securities laws, including expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with the organization and initial registration of shares of the Fund; insurance expenses; fees and expenses of the custodian, transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, shareholder service agent, plan agent, administrator (excluding fees and expenses payable to the Adviser under this Agreement and the Management Agreement), accounting and pricing services agent and underwriter of the Fund; expenses, including clerical expenses, of issue, sale, redemption or repurchase of shares of the Fund; the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the cost of printing or preparing prospectuses and statements of additional information for delivery to shareholders; the cost of printing or preparing stock certificates or any other documents, statements or reports to shareholders; expenses of shareholders' meetings and proxy solicitations; and all other operating expenses not specifically assumed by the Fund. For purposes of this Agreement, \"operating expenses\" shall not include advertising, promotion and other expenses incurred directly or indirectly in connection with the sale or distribution of the Fund's shares (including expenses that the Fund is authorized to pay pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act, if any).",

The Fund will be responsible for covering certain operating expenses, including advertising, promotion and other expenses incurred directly or indirectly in connection with the sale or distribution of the Fund's shares (including expenses that the Fund is authorized to pay pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act, if any). The specific list of operating expenses covered by the adviser will be agreed upon in a separate addendum.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Adviser pays all operating expenses specifically assumed by the Fund under the Management Agreement. The modified text creates a contradiction by stating that the Adviser pays *some* operating expenses, and the Fund is responsible for other operating expenses. This shift creates uncertainty about which party is responsible for which expenses, potentially leading to disputes.",

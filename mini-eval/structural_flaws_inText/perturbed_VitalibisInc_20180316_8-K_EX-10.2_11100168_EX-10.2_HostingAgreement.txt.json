                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Regardless of the term, Licensee can terminate Agreement with at least one hundred eighty (180) days written notice with no further obligation.",
                "changed_text": "Regardless of the term, Licensee can terminate Agreement with at least one hundred eighty (180) days written notice and may be subject to a termination fee depending on the circumstances, as determined by VOTOCAST.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Licensee's ability to terminate the agreement. The original text states 'no further obligation,' providing a clear condition for termination. The modified text adds 'may be subject to a termination fee depending on the circumstances, as determined by VOTOCAST,' creating uncertainty and contradicting the initial statement. This gives VOTOCAST discretionary power to impose fees, thereby undermining the Licensee's termination rights.",

                "changed_text": "VOTOCAST may provide written notice to Licensee prior to any scheduled maintenance or required repairs that would cause the Services to be inaccessible, but is not obligated to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear obligation for VOTOCAST to provide reasonable written notice. The modified text changes 'agrees to provide' to 'may provide,' and explicitly states that VOTOCAST is not obligated to provide such notice. This directly contradicts the initial statement and introduces uncertainty regarding VOTOCAST's responsibility to inform Licensee about service interruptions, potentially impacting Licensee's operations.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall pay VOTOCAST the Services Fees in accordance with the applicable fee and payment schedule set forth in Exhibit A hereto. VOTOCAST expressly reserves the right to change its rates charged hereunder for the Services during any Renewal Term (as detined herein) but agrees that rates may not increase by more than ten percent (10%) during any Renewal Term.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall pay VOTOCAST the Services Fees in accordance with the applicable fee and payment schedule set forth in Exhibit A hereto. VOTOCAST expressly reserves the right to change its rates charged hereunder for the Services at any time, with no limit on the percentage of increase during any term, provided reasonable notice is given.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear limitation on rate increases during renewal terms, capping them at 10%. The modified text removes this limit and grants VOTOCAST the right to change rates at any time with no percentage restriction. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the stability of pricing and introduces uncertainty for Licensee regarding future costs. It undermines the original agreement by allowing unlimited rate increases during any term, potentially rendering the contract economically unfavorable for the Licensee.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement can be terminated with a sixty (60) day written notice. By reducing it to thirty (30) days in the changed text, it contradicts Section 10, which outlines specific termination clauses and, thus, introduces a conflicting term for non-cause termination. This creates uncertainty about the proper termination notice period.",

                "explanation": "The original states that this agreement replaces any prior agreements. Changing it to 'supplements' directly contradicts this statement.

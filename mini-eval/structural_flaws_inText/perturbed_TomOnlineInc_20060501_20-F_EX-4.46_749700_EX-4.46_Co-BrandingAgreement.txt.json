For purposes hereof, the holding, directly or indirectly, of 30% or more of the issued share capital of a Person shall be deemed the Control of such Person.",
                "changed_text": "1.12 \"Control\" means, with respect to any Person, the possession, directly or indirectly, of the affirmative power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of securities, partnership interests or other ownership interests, by contract, by membership or involvement in the board of directors or other management structure of such Person, or otherwise. For purposes hereof, the holding, directly or indirectly, of 5% or more of the issued share capital of a Person may be deemed the Control of such Person depending on specific circumstances.",
                "explanation": "By changing the share capital percentage from '30% or more' to '5% or more' with the added caveat 'depending on specific circumstances,' the definition of 'Control' becomes contradictory and ambiguous. This could lead to disputes about whether one entity actually controls another, and about responsibility and liability",

This Agreement may not be assigned by a party to this Agreement to any other Person without the express written approval of the other parties to this Agreement and any attempt at assignment in violation of this section shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Skype or Skype Holding may assign this Agreement to a third party without such consent in the event of a merger, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of Skype's or Skype Holding's assets or voting securities, provided that written notice of such assignment is delivered to Online BVI and the Company and the assignee assumes all the responsibilities and obligations provided herein.",

However, this right of assignment by Skype or Skype Holding is subject to Online BVI's right to first refusal to acquire the contract on the same terms as the third party.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows Skype/Skype Holding to assign the agreement without consent in specific situations. The added sentence gives Online BVI a right of first refusal. This creates a conflict: can Skype freely assign, or must it first offer the contract to Online BVI? Enforcement is now unclear.",

However, information related to the specific pricing of Skype products and services will always be considered Confidential Information, regardless of its availability elsewhere.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence creates a contradiction. The original exemptions allow information to be excluded from confidentiality if it is independently obtained, becomes public, etc. The addition says pricing information is *always* confidential, even if it meets the exclusion criteria. This makes it unclear if pricing information is truly exempt if it falls under (i), (ii), (iii), or (v).",

Compensation In consideration for the services and facilities provided by you hereunder, Nationwide (on behalf of the Funds) will pay to you, and you will accept as full payment therefore, a fee at the annual rate designated in Appendix A of the average daily net assets of a Fund's Shares owned of record or beneficially by your customers from time to time for which you provide administrative support services hereunder. Such fee will be computed daily and payable monthly by Nationwide within thirty (30) days of receipt from you of a valid invoice (in excel format) that identifies, for each CUSIP of each Fund, the number of sub-accounts, participants or beneficial shareholders serviced by you and such other information as may be necessary to validate the fee payable. The fee rate stated above may be prospectively increased or decreased by the Funds and/or Nationwide, in their sole discretion, at any time upon notice to you. Further, Nationwide or a Fund may, in its sole discretion and without notice, suspend or withdraw the sale of such Shares, including the sale of such Shares to you for the account of any customer(s). Nationwide, in its sole discretion, may arrange for the payment to you of the fees under this Agreement directly by the Funds rather than through Nationwide. Quarterly and Other Reports 2",

It also allows either party to terminate for any reason with 90 days notice. The revised text removes the requirement of 'Disinterested Trustees,' implies any trustee can decide. It allows Nationwide to determine 'material breach solely,' which is biased, and removes the 90-day notice period for Nationwide.",

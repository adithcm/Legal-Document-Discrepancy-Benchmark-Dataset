Upon expiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were before the Second Amendment Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party's right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall survive the Second Amendment's expiration.",

Upon expiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were before the Second Amendment Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party's right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall survive the Second Amendment's expiration. However, Premier's right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment regarding pricing for Bottled Products will not survive the Second Amendment's expiration.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that a Party's right to enforce the terms of the Second Amendment survives its expiration. The modified version introduces an exception, stating that Premier's right to enforce pricing terms specifically for Bottled Products does not survive expiration. This creates a contradiction, making it unclear whether Premier can enforce these pricing terms after December 31, 2021, and creates potential for dispute.",

                "explanation": "The original text implies that Heritage *shall* produce the products, with exceptions noted by [***], creating an expectation of production. The modified text adds a clause allowing Heritage to *choose* not to produce certain Products if demand is low. This creates a contradiction because the mandatory 'shall produce' is weakened by the discretionary 'may choose not to produce', which may cause uncertainty to premier on expected output volume.",

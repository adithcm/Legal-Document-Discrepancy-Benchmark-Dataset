                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty regarding Kiromic's financial commitment. The original text states a clear obligation, while the modified version makes it discretionary and dependent on budget, creating a contradiction and potential for disputes.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction by suggesting that previously completed aspects of the agreement might be affected by withdrawal, contradicting the original clause that protected executed parts. This weakens the assurance and creates ambiguity around completed obligations.",

It introduces a *possibility* of mediation with a choice of law left to the mediator, undermining the original arbitration clause and the certainty it provided about dispute resolution mechanisms.",

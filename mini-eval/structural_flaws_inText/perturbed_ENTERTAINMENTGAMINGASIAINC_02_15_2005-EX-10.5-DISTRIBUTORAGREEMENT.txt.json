TERM\n\nAs provided for in this Section 1, the term of this Agreement shall be for a period of five (5) years, beginning on the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"); provided, however, the Initial Term shall be subject to automatic successive renewal terms of three (3) years each (the \"Renewal Terms\" and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\").",

TERM\n\nAs provided for in this Section 1, the term of this Agreement shall be for a period of five (5) years, beginning on the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"); provided, however, the Initial Term will be reviewed for successive renewal terms of three (3) years each (the \"Renewal Terms\" and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\").",
                "explanation": "The original text states the renewal term is 'automatic', but by changing that to 'will be reviewed', it creates a contradiction, implying that renewal is not guaranteed and will be subject to evaluation.",

Except when this Agreement is terminated due to the uncured breach of Distributor, Distributor shall have within one (1) month of termination of this Agreement the right to return the Products purchased by Distributor to Vendor provided that the Products are unopened upon receipt by Vendor. Distributor will receive a credit for the full price paid by Distributor for the Products.",

Distributor may receive a credit for the full price paid by Distributor for the Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that except when there's an uncured breach, the distributor 'shall' have the right to return products and 'will' receive credit. By changing 'Except when' to 'Even if', and then by changing 'shall' to 'may' and 'will' to 'may', this removes the original statement's guarantee and makes it discretionary, which contradicts the certainty established previously.",

However, the vendor might extend the exclusivity of the distributor to the product in question.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Vendor 'shall' have the right to convert to non-exclusive. Now by changing shall to 'may', the first sentence introduces uncertainty and then, by adding the second sentence creates further confusion by suggesting the Vendor 'might' extend the exclusivity, directly contradicting the first.",

Approval is not guaranteed. The term for renewal and conditions of that renewal are subject to change at any time, at our sole discretion.\n3.2.1 Whether you are in default of any provision of this Agreement, or any other agreement between you and us or our affiliates, or any standards set forth in the Manuals will be considered at the time of the renewal request. \n3.2.2 Whether you have satisfied all monetary obligations owed by you to us and our affiliates, and have timely met those obligations throughout the term of this Agreement will be considered at the time of the renewal request.\n3.2.3 You may or may not execute our then-current form of Master Franchise Agreement and any addenda thereto for any renewal term. We will decide whether that renewal agreement shall supersede this Agreement in all respects.\n3.2.4 Compliance with our then-current qualification and training requirements may be required but at our discretion.\n3.2.5 You may be asked to pay us a renewal fee in a sum determined at the time of the renewal, if applicable.\n3.2.6 You may be asked to execute a release, in a form prescribed by us, of any and all claims which you may have or believe to have against us and/or our affiliates and our respective officers, directors, agents and employees.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the conditions and duration of renewals. The modified text makes the renewal process uncertain by using vague language like \"may have the option,\" \"potentially different terms and conditions,\" and \"approval is not guaranteed.\" It introduces uncertainty regarding the renewal fee, the execution of a new agreement, and compliance with training requirements, contradicting the original text's firm conditions. This creates ambiguity about the franchisee's right to renew and the terms of renewal.",

We will not grant other franchises nor establish our own Unit Franchises within the Master Territory during the term of this Agreement unless you do not meet the Minimum Development Quota. If you do not meet the Minimum Development Quota, we may cancel your exclusive right to market and sell Unit Franchises in your Master Territory and may sell additional Master Franchises within your Master Territory, or we may begin operations of our own in your Master Territory, or we may terminate this Agreement.",

We retain the right to grant other franchises and/or establish our own Unit Franchises within the Master Territory during the term of this Agreement, even if you meet the Minimum Development Quota. Whether or not you meet the Minimum Development Quota, we have the unilateral right to determine if your exclusive right to market and sell Unit Franchises in your Master Territory may be cancelled. We may sell additional Master Franchises within your Master Territory, or we may begin operations of our own in your Master Territory, or we may terminate this Agreement, all at our discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear consequence for not meeting the Minimum Development Quota: loss of exclusivity. The modified version introduces contradiction by saying the franchisee *may or may not* need to meet the quota and that the franchisor retains the right to grant franchises even if the quota *is* met. This change creates uncertainty about the consequences of meeting or not meeting the quota, and also creates uncertainty about whether they can retain exclusivity.",

                "explanation": "The original clause says *any* obligations that are supposed to survive, will survive. The modified version creates direct contradiction by saying *no* obligations survive unless explicitly stated AND unless the company later decides at its own discretion that they do. This directly contradicts the explicit survival of terms.",

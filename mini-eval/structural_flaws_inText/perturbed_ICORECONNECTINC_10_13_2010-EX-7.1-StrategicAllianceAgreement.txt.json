                "original_text": "3. TERM   This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date of this Agreement and shall remain in effect for a period of 5 years (\"Initial Term\"). Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically on a five (5) year basis, unless one party notifies the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least sixty 90 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.\n\nIn such an instance, all compensation will continue for a extended period of five years from the date of termination for all subscriptions tagged as USA MCO.",
                "changed_text": "3. TERM   This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date of this Agreement and shall remain in effect for a period of 5 years (\"Initial Term\"). Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed only upon mutual written agreement of both parties made no less than sixty 90 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.\n\nIn such an instance, all compensation will continue only until the date of termination for all subscriptions tagged as USA MCO.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement auto-renews unless a party terminates. The modified text indicates renewal requires mutual written agreement, contradicting the auto-renewal clause. Furthermore, the clause on compensation following termination is modified to cease on the date of termination, conflicting with the original text's clause where compensation continues for five years from termination, creating uncertainty on the term.",

All Confidential Information disclosed both orally and in writing by the disclosing party (\"Discloser\") will be considered Confidential Information by the receiving party (\"Recipient\") and subject to terms of this Agreement, even if such information is not conspicuously designated as \"Confidential\" or even when provided orally and not identified as confidential at the time of disclosure.",
                "changed_text": "A. \"Confidential Information\" as used in this Agreement shall mean only that information explicitly labeled as confidential by IMedicor. It does not include information which is generally known or easily ascertainable by the public. All Confidential Information disclosed both orally and in writing by the disclosing party (\"Discloser\") will be considered Confidential Information by the receiving party (\"Recipient\") and subject to terms of this Agreement, only if such information is conspicuously designated as \"Confidential\" at the time of disclosure.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines 'Confidential Information' broadly, encompassing various technical and non-technical data, regardless of explicit labeling. The modified clause narrows the definition to only information explicitly labeled as confidential, thus contradicting the original broad definition and making it unclear what information exactly falls under the 'confidential' umbrella, thus creating uncertainty for both parties.",

ASSIGNABILITY   The license granted hereunder is specific to the USA MCO and may be assigned by any act of the USA MCO or by operation of law without the written consent of IMedicor. However, IMedicor is prohibited from assigning its rights or obligations under this agreement under any circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stated that the license granted to USA MCO could not be assigned without IMedicor's consent. The modified clause states that the license can be assigned without IMedicor's consent, contradicting the original clause. This creates uncertainty about the circumstances under which the license may or may not be assigned. Furthermore, by forbidding IMedicor from assigning its rights, this adds another layer of conflict.",

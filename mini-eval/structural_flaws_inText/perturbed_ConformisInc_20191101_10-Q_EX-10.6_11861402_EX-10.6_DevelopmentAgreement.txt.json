                "changed_text": "1.1 Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings, and regardless of whether a term is explicitly defined in this section or any other section of this Agreement, its meaning may be subject to further interpretation and clarification as determined by the Parties in their sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clause aimed to provide clarity by defining terms within the agreement. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that even defined terms may be subject to further interpretation, contradicting the purpose of having defined terms and creating uncertainty about their meaning and enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees, subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, that the requirement to execute, acknowledge, and deliver further documents and instruments, and to do all such other acts, as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement, is subject to further negotiation and may require additional consideration as deemed necessary by each Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that parties will execute further documents without additional consideration to fulfill the agreement's intent. The modification directly contradicts this by stating that the need for such documents is 'subject to further negotiation' and 'may require additional consideration,' introducing uncertainty and potential conflicts regarding the obligation to provide necessary documentation.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that modifications or amendments must be in writing and signed. The changed clause contradicts this by allowing verbal agreements to amend the contract, making it unclear which agreements are binding and potentially leading to disputes about the validity of amendments.",

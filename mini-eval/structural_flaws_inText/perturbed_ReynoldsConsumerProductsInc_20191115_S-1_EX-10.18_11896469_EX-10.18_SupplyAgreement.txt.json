                "original_text": "The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to take advantage of any of its rights shall not operate as a continuing waiver of such rights. No right or obligation under this Agreement will be considered to have been waived by a Party unless such waiver is in writing and is signed by an officer of the waiving Party and delivered to the other Party. No consent to or waiver of a breach by either Party will constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any other, different, or subsequent breach by such Party.",
                "changed_text": "The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to take advantage of any of its rights shall operate as a continuing waiver of such rights. No right or obligation under this Agreement will be considered to have been waived by a Party even if such waiver is not in writing or signed. No consent to or waiver of a breach by either Party will constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any other, different, or subsequent breach by such Party.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall not' to 'shall' and removing the 'in writing' requirement, this creates a contradiction. The original clause protects a party from unintentionally waiving rights. The modified clause states that any failure to enforce strict performance IS a continuing waiver, and written waivers are not required. This creates uncertainty as to whether consistent non-enforcement of a clause means it is waived, even without written documentation, directly conflicting with the original intent.",

Notices will be effective upon actual receipt by the receiving Party. An emailed notice will be effective against a receiving Party only if the Receiving Party acknowledge receipt of the emailed notice in a return notice to the notifying Party. A receiving Party agrees to acknowledge receipt of an email notice in good faith promptly following receipt. A Party may change its address for notice by giving notice to the other party Pursuant to this Subsection.",

Notices will be effective upon sending. An emailed notice will be effective immediately upon sending, regardless of whether the Receiving Party acknowledges receipt. A receiving Party is not obligated to acknowledge receipt of an email notice. A Party may change its address for notice by giving notice to the other party Pursuant to this Subsection.",
                "explanation": "This creates a direct contradiction regarding when a notice is considered effective. The original text requires 'actual receipt' and acknowledgment of email notices. The modified text states that notices are effective upon sending, regardless of receipt or acknowledgment. This introduces uncertainty about whether a party can claim ignorance of a notice because they did not receive or acknowledge it, undermining the original intent of ensuring proper notification.",

This Section does not prevent the reliance on the descriptive information in transaction documents identifying the ordered Products (e.g., the type and quantity of ordered products and scheduled date and location for delivery).

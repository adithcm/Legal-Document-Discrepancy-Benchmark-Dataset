Galaxy shall treat the Records as Confidential Information and it shall not provide to or allow access by any third party except as required or allowed by this Agreement.",

Galaxy may treat the Records as confidential or not, at its sole discretion, and it may provide to or allow access by any third party with or without reason, and without the consent of Telnet.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that Galaxy owns the records but must use them according to the agreement's terms and treat them as confidential, limiting third-party access. The modified version contradicts this by granting Galaxy unrestricted use and access to the records, nullifying the confidentiality and intended use provisions.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic renewal unless cancelled with 60 days' notice. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating that renewal is at Galaxy's sole discretion, eliminating the automatic renewal and notice requirement, creating uncertainty for Telnet regarding the agreement's continuation.",

The modified text negates this by stating that confidentiality ends immediately upon termination. This creates a direct conflict concerning the duration of confidentiality obligations.",

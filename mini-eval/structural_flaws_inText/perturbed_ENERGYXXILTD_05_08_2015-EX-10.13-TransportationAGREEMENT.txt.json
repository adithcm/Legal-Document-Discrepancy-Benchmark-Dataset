                "original_text": "8.1 Term. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated by either Party upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice.",
                "changed_text": "8.1 Term. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated by Transporter, at its sole discretion, without prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original agreement, which allows either party to terminate with 30 days written notice. The modified clause grants only the Transporter the right to terminate the agreement and eliminates the notice period. This creates uncertainty and disadvantages the Shipper.",

                "changed_text": "3.1 Transportation Charges. Crude Petroleum accepted for transportation by Transporter may be subject to transportation rates determined by the Transporter, notwithstanding the rates outlined in Exhibit A. The transporter holds the right to adjust rates as deemed necessary. Any other applicable charges specified in this Article 3 will remain unchanged.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that transportation charges are based on Exhibit A. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that the Transporter can determine rates, effectively nullifying the agreed-upon rates in Exhibit A. This weakens the contractual obligation and opens the door for arbitrary pricing.",

This section has been removed from the modified text. This expands Shipper's responsibility to all possible incidents even if Transporter is at fault.",

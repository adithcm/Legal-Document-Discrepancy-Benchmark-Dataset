Talent represents and warrants that he has not granted nor will he grant to any other party any right, permission, or license to use the Property in connection with the advertisement,  sale, or promotion of the Product or in connection with products that are identical or substantially similar to the Product.",

Talent represents and warrants that he may grant to other parties rights, permissions, or licenses to use the Property in connection with the advertisement, sale, or promotion of products that are identical or substantially similar to the Product. Such grants will be subject to Company's approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original text by stating that Talent *may* grant rights to others for similar products, directly conflicting with the initial warranty that Talent *has not* and *will not* grant such rights. This introduces uncertainty and potential disputes over Talent's exclusivity.",

The period of license granted shall be for the Term and shall extend for a period of twenty four (24) months or until terminated as per clause 8 herein. It is agreed that the Term may be extended upon mutual agreement between the parties.",

The period of license granted shall be for the Term and may extend beyond twenty four (24) months regardless of clause 8 herein. It is agreed that the Term extension is solely at the Company's discretion, subject to Talent's continued good faith performance of their duties.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces contradictions regarding the term of the agreement. It states the license may extend *beyond* 24 months, overriding the original fixed term and the termination clause (8). Also, the condition that extension is at Company's discretion contradicts 'mutual agreement' that extension needs both party's approval. This uncertainty about the contract's duration could cause disagreement.",

                "explanation": "By modifying the section related to 'Review of Materials', this creates conflicts around the extent of Talent's approval rights. Initially, Talent's explicit approval was a must, now they are allowed to disapprove for any reason. The explicit right of 'approval' for all materials are overwritten by Talentâ€™s explicit consent. Then also conflicting with automatic approval after ten days if there is no response from Talent's side. This introduces uncertainty regarding the approval process. Potentially leading the dispute for usage of property.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Firm Service' outlines specific conditions under which interruption is permissible. The modified definition grants the Transporter unlimited discretion to interrupt service, directly contradicting the original limitations. This creates uncertainty regarding the reliability of 'Firm Service' and the obligations of the Transporter.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states there is NO minimum amount of residue gas that the customer is required to deliver. The changed text introduces a MINIMUM amount, directly contradicting the original statement.

The changed text states that consent is at the 'sole discretion' of the party and no assignments are permitted, directly contradicting the provision about not unreasonably withholding consent and the permitted assignments.

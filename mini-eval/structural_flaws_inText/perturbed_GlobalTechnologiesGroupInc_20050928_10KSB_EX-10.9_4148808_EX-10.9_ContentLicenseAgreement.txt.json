The initial term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and end twelve (12) months after the Launch (the \"Term\"). IMNTV may, at its sole discretion, extend the Agreement. The terms and conditions for any extension are subject to negotiation and mutual agreement by both parties. This extension is not predicated on satisfactory performance by either party and IMNTV can terminate the contract at any time. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement by their duly authorized representatives.     DISTRIBUTOR",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that the agreement would be extended on the same terms and conditions for additional one-year terms, provided both parties agree and performance is satisfactory. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that IMNTV has sole discretion in extending the agreement, terms of the extension are subject to negotiation, not predicated on satisfactory performance, and IMNTV can terminate the contract at any time. This contradicts the original text's implication of a more mutually assured renewal based on satisfactory performance, and creates uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants the Distributor non-exclusive rights to perform certain actions. The modified text introduces conditional rights, requiring written approval, express permission or review for many of these actions. This contradicts the initial grant of non-exclusive rights, creating uncertainty about the Distributor's actual freedom to act under the agreement without constant IMNTV oversight and permission.",

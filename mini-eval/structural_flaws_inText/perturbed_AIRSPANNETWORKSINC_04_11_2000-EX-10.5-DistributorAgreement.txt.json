                "explanation": "The original text states that the distributor is an \"exclusive distributor\", implying a monopoly within the territory. By removing the word 'exclusive', the agreement now allows Airspan to appoint other distributors in the same territory, contradicting the initial clause. This introduces uncertainty about the distributor's competitive advantage.",

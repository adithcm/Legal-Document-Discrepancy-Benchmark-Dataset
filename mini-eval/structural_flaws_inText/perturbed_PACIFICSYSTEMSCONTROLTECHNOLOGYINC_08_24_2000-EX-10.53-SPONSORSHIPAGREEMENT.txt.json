                "original_text": "For the above sponsorship components, the Sponsor agrees to pay ACM a total amount of US$400,000.00.  The amount is payable 180 days from the date of the Event.",
                "changed_text": "For the above sponsorship components, the Sponsor agrees to pay ACM a total amount of US$400,000.00. The amount is payable upon receipt of invoice, but no later than 30 days after the Event.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. Initially, payment was due 180 days after the event. Now, it's due upon receipt of invoice, but no later than 30 days after the event. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline, benefiting one party over the other. It is not clear when the invoice will be sent.",

                "changed_text": "This is understood between the parties that SLD may resale all or some of the above sponsorship components to other buyers. All third-party display materials must be approved by ACM, and ACM reserves the right to deny approval at any time before, during, or after the event for any reason.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that SLD may resell sponsorships, subject to ACM approval of materials five days prior to the event. The modification removes the five-day deadline and gives ACM the right to deny approval at any time, for any reason, including *after* the event. This contradicts the initial understanding and introduces significant uncertainty regarding SLD's ability to actually resell the sponsorships they purchased. This ambiguity hurts SLD, as their ability to resell is now less secure.",

Video and audio excerpts of the Event must have ACM's approval in writing prior to such use. The Sponsor's use of intellectual property must adhere to ACM's guidelines.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that both ACM and the Sponsor retain their intellectual property rights. The changed text removes the explicit statement that the Sponsor retains *all* of its rights and adds that the Sponsor's use of intellectual property must adhere to ACM's guidelines. This creates a contradiction because the original text implies independent rights, while the revised text suggests that the Sponsor's rights are subordinate to ACM's guidelines. It is now ambiguous what rights the Sponsor actually retains, weakening their position.",

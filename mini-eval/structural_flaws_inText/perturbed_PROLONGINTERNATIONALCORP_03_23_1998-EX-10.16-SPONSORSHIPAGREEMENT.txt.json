                "original_text": "7. Exclusivity. During the term of this Agreement, Sabco will not ----------- represent or accept as a primary, secondary, or associate sponsor any other company reasonably deemed to be competitive with Prolong products.",
                "changed_text": "7. Exclusivity. During the term of this Agreement, Sabco will endeavor to avoid representing companies directly competitive with Prolong. However, Sabco retains the right to represent other companies, even if they offer similar products, provided that Sabco makes reasonable efforts to minimize any potential conflict of interest. Sabco's decision regarding what constitutes a conflict of interest shall be final.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits Sabco from representing any competitor of Prolong. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating Sabco will 'endeavor to avoid' conflicts but reserves the right to represent similar companies if they 'make reasonable efforts to minimize conflict.' This contradicts the earlier absolute exclusivity clause and makes enforcement uncertain. The statement that Sabco's decision is final introduces further uncertainty.",

Prolong shall be responsible for all first class travel expenses relating to each driver appearance, i.e. hotel, airfare, meals, etc. Additional appearances by Sabco drivers shall be at the discounted rate of [ * ] ($[ * ]) Dollars per day per driver, [ * ]. Sabco shall further provide the services of each driver for one free day for commercial use (up to six hours each) for still photo shoot, TV and radio/commercial production. Prolong shall be responsible for all first class travel expenses relating to each driver appearance, i.e. hotel, airfare, meals, etc. All Sabco drivers, while under contract with Team SABCO, shall allow their likeness, voice, picture and signature to be used for commercial purposes endorsing Prolong at no additional costs during the term of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "3. Driver Appearances. Sabco shall provide unto Prolong five aggregate driver appearances at no fee. The duration and specific details of these appearances, including travel expenses, shall be subject to mutual agreement between Sabco and Prolong. Sabco may provide additional driver appearances, but the terms and fees for these appearances will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The extent to which drivers' likeness, voice, picture, and signature can be used for commercial purposes endorsing Prolong will be subject to individual driver agreements and may incur additional costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly outlines the terms for driver appearances, including the number of free appearances, their duration, and the cost of additional appearances. It also states that drivers' likeness can be used for commercial purposes at no additional cost. The modified version introduces contradiction and uncertainty. It makes the duration and details of the free appearances subject to 'mutual agreement,' contradicting the original fixed terms. It also makes the use of drivers' likeness subject to individual agreements and potentially incurring additional costs, directly contradicting the prior 'no additional cost' clause.",

                "changed_text": "1. Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence with the first race of the 1998 Winston Cup season and shall continue until the final race of the year-2000 Winston Cup season, unless terminated earlier by either party with 30 days written notice. Prolong's continued sponsorship is contingent upon Sabco achieving certain performance metrics, to be determined solely at Prolong's discretion. If these metrics are not met, Prolong may terminate the agreement immediately.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a clear and fixed term for the agreement. The modified version introduces the possibility of early termination by either party with 30 days' notice, directly contradicting the fixed term. Furthermore, it gives Prolong the unilateral right to terminate the agreement based on performance metrics 'determined solely at Prolong's discretion,' creating further uncertainty and contradicting the initial fixed term commitment.",

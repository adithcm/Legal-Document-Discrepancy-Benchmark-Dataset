The Company reserves the right to modify or remove products from the list of Licensed Products at its sole discretion, without requiring an amendment to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that other products can be added to the list of 'Licensed Products' only through a written amendment signed by all parties. The modified version allows the Company to unilaterally modify the list, contradicting the original requirement for mutual agreement and creating uncertainty about which products are actually covered by the agreement at any given time.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that amounts donated will be allocated to the NFL Alumni Northern California Chapter.

                "explanation": "The original agreement explicitly states that the Company will provide quarterly sales reports of Licensed Products upon request to the NFLA-NC. The modified version introduces a contradiction by stating the Company is not required to provide these reports, and if they do, they're confidential. This undermines the NFLA-NC's ability to verify donation amounts and creates uncertainty about the level of transparency they will receive.",

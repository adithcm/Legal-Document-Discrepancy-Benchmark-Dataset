                "explanation": "The original text states that the Celebrity is limited to six speaking engagements and five conference calls, implying a maximum. The modified text states that the Celebrity will be required a minimum of those amounts, which creates a contradiction about the scope of required services and could cause disputes about the extent of the CELEBRITY's obligations.",

The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the COMPANY can revoke these options at its discretion, even if the conditions are met, contradicting the original guarantee and creating ambiguity.",

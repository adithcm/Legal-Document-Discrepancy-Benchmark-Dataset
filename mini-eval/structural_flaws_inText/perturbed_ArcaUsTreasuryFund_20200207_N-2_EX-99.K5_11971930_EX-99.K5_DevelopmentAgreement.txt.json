The Fund shall indemnify them. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating the Blockchain Administrator may be held liable and the Fund will not indemnify them, creating uncertainty about liability and indemnification.",

However, the modified section directly contradicts this by stating that these provisions do not survive termination.

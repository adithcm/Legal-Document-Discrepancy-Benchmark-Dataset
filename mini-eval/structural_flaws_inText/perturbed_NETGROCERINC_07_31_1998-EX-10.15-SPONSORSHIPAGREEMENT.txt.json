                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For the term of the Agreement, Excite will not enter into any agreement to display and shall not display on the Excite Site content created by Excite promoting NetGrocer's \"Competitors\", content created by NetGrocer's Competitors, promotional placements and/or advertising banners from NetGrocer's Competitors or make available on the Excite Site online supermarket sales offered by NetGrocer's Competitors.",
                "changed_text": "For the term of the Agreement, Excite retains the right to display content created by Excite promoting NetGrocer's \"Competitors\", content created by NetGrocer's Competitors, promotional placements and/or advertising banners from NetGrocer's Competitors, and may make available on the Excite Site online supermarket sales offered by NetGrocer's Competitors. This right is at Excite's sole discretion and may be exercised at any time without prior notice to NetGrocer.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original exclusivity clause. The original text strictly prohibits Excite from promoting NetGrocer's competitors, while the modified text explicitly grants Excite the right to do so. This creates uncertainty about whether NetGrocer has any protection against Excite promoting rival services.",

                "changed_text": "Excite retains shared right, title and interest to information regarding customers who access the NetGrocer Site pursuant to the Agreement, for marketing purposes. NetGrocer's interest in the customer information is subordinate to Excite's right to utilize the data for improving user experience across the Excite Network.",
                "explanation": "The original text assigns sole ownership of customer information to NetGrocer. The modified text states that Excite also has a right to this data for marketing. This creates a conflict of interest, potentially leading to disputes about data usage and privacy. The subordination clause further weakens NetGrocer's claim to the data.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Excite will use reasonable commercial efforts to deliver [*] \"Impressions\" of the promotional placements and advertising banners described in Sections 1 (a) - (d) in the first year of the term of the Agreement and to deliver [*] \"Impressions\" of the promotional placements and advertising banners described in Sections 1 (a) - (d) in the second year of the term of the Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Excite will use reasonable commercial efforts to attempt to deliver [*] \"Impressions\" of the promotional placements and advertising banners described in Sections 1 (a) - (d) in the first year of the term of the Agreement. Excite is not obligated to deliver any minimum number of impressions of the promotional placements and advertising banners described in Sections 1 (a) - (d) in the second year of the term of the Agreement. Delivery of impressions is subject to resource availability and network conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits Excite to delivering a certain number of impressions. The modified text removes the impression commitment for the second year, making impression delivery uncertain. The added clause makes impression delivery dependent on external factors and effectively negates the obligation in the first sentence, which creates doubt in the enforceability of this.",

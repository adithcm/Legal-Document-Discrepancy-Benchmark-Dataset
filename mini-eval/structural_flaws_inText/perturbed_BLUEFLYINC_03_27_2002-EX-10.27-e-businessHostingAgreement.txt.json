                "changed_text": "Each Service Option Attachment will renew automatically for an additional term equal in duration to the previous term of the applicable Service Option Attachment unless either party notifies the other party in writing at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then-current term for the applicable Service Option Attachment that it has elected to terminate such Service Option Attachment. However, renewal is not guaranteed and is subject to IBM's discretion based on its current business priorities.",
                "explanation": "The original text states automatic renewal with a 90-day notice exception. The modified text adds a clause that the renewal is also 'subject to IBM's discretion,' creating a contradiction and uncertainty about the renewal process. The automatic nature is undermined by IBM's discretionary power.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states charges will be specified in writing in the attachments. The added clause allows IBM to change the charges 'at any point in time with only verbal notification,' creating a contradiction and uncertainty about the reliability of the written charges.",

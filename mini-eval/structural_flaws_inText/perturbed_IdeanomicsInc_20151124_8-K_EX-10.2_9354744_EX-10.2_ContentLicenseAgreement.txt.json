                "explanation": "The original text grants a license that can be perpetual or non-perpetual based on Schedule A. Adding the line 'This license is only valid for a period of 1 year, after which a renewal is required' contradicts the possibility of a perpetual license, creating ambiguity about the term of the license. This contradicts the original provision which allows for a perpetual license if specified in schedule A.",

                "original_text": "For purposes of Section 7 of the Agreement, UBS AG hereby consents to the Permitted Security Interest.\n\n\"Permitted Security Interest\" means the collateral assignment by the Counterparty of the Cap Collateral to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and the granting to the Master Servicer of a security interest in the Cap Collateral pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.\n\n\"Cap Collateral\" means all right, title and interest of the Counterparty in this Agreement, each Transaction hereunder, and all present and future amounts payable by UBS AG to the Counterparty under or in connection with the Agreement or any Transaction governed by the Agreement, whether or not evidenced by a Confirmation, including, without limitation, any transfer or termination of any such Transaction.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of Section 7 of the Agreement, UBS AG may, at its sole discretion, consent to a Permitted Security Interest.\n\n\"Permitted Security Interest\" means a potential collateral assignment by the Counterparty of the Cap Collateral to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and the possible granting to the Master Servicer of a security interest in the Cap Collateral pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.\n\n\"Cap Collateral\" generally refers to the Counterparty's potential interest in this Agreement, each Transaction hereunder, and amounts that may become payable by UBS AG to the Counterparty, but such interest and amounts are subject to various conditions and may not always exist.",
                "explanation": "The original text states UBS AG \"hereby consents\" to the Permitted Security Interest, implying an unconditional agreement. The revised text introduces uncertainty by stating UBS AG \"may, at its sole discretion, consent,\" contradicting the original mandatory consent. The modified definition of 'Permitted Security Interest' uses terms like 'potential' and 'possible,' while the 'Cap Collateral' definition uses 'generally refers to' and 'may not always exist,' creating ambiguity about the actual security interest and collateral. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement because it is unclear whether a security interest is actually granted and what the collateral truly encompasses.",

Notwithstanding any provision herein or in the ISDA Form to the contrary, the obligations of Counterparty hereunder are limited recourse obligations of Counterparty, payable solely from the Trust Estate (as defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) and the proceeds thereof to satisfy Counterparty's obligations hereunder. However, under certain circumstances deemed appropriate by UBS AG, UBS AG retains the right to pursue any additional legal avenues beyond the Trust Estate to recoup any losses. In the event that the Trust Estate and proceeds thereof should be insufficient to satisfy all claims outstanding and following the realization of the Trust Estate and the distribution of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, any claims against or obligations of Counterparty under the ISDA Form or any other confirmation thereunder, still outstanding shall be subject to further negotiation and potential legal action at the discretion of UBS AG.",
                "explanation": "The original 'Non-Recourse' clause explicitly states that any outstanding claims against the Counterparty are extinguished after the Trust Estate is exhausted. The modified version directly contradicts this by adding that UBS AG retains the right to pursue additional legal avenues beyond the Trust Estate under certain circumstances. It also changes the extinguishment of claims to being 'subject to further negotiation and potential legal action,' completely negating the original non-recourse nature. This creates significant uncertainty as to the actual liability of the Counterparty and the enforceability of the non-recourse provision.",

If a Ratings Event (as defined below) has occurred and UBS AG has not complied with the requirements set forth in the succeeding paragraph within the 30 day time period specified therein, then an Additional Termination Event shall have occurred with respect to UBS AG and UBS AG shall be the sole Affected Party with respect to such an Additional Termination Event.",

                "explanation": "The original states that if a Ratings Event has occurred and UBS AG hasn't complied within 30 days, then an Additional Termination Event \"shall have occurred\". The modified text changes 'will apply' to 'may apply, subject to mutual agreement,' removing the automatic nature. Instead of an event occurring, the text introduces conditionals based on what 'might be considered' as events and if the requirements are 'fully complied'. The certainty of the original Additional Termination Event being triggered is replaced by negotiation and discretion, making it unclear under what circumstances it will be enforced.",

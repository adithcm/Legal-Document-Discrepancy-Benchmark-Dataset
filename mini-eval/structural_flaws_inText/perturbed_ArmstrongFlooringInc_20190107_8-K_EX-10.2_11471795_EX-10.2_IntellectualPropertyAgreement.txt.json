Each Party shall ensure that any sublicense that it grants to a Sublicensee does not conflict with this Agreement. For clarity, granting a sublicense shall not relieve the Parties of any obligations hereunder and each Party shall cause each of its Sublicensees to comply, and shall remain responsible for such Sublicensees' compliance, with all terms and conditions hereof applicable to the Parties. At the request of a licensing Party, the other Party shall provide to the licensing Party a list of all Sublicensees and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the licensing Party in connection with Sublicensees' compliance with this Agreement.",

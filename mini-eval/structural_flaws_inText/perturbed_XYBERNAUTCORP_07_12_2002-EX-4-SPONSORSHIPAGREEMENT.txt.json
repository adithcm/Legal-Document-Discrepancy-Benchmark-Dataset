                "original_text": "In consideration of the rights granted to XC pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 hereof and the provisions of this  Agreement,  XC shall issue to AJR (i) 125,000  shares  (the  \"Shares\")  of common  stock,  par value  $0.01 of XC (the \"Common  Stock\");  and (ii)  warrants to purchase  50,000 shares of Common Stock (the  \"Warrants\").  The Warrants shall have an exercise price of $1.18 per share being the closing  market price for the Common Stock on April 30, 2002 and shall be exercisable for a period of three (3) years from their date of issue.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the rights granted to XC pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 hereof and the provisions of this  Agreement,  XC may issue to AJR (i) up to 125,000 shares  (the  \"Shares\")  of common  stock,  par value  $0.01 of XC (the \"Common  Stock\");  and (ii)  warrants to purchase up to 50,000 shares of Common Stock (the  \"Warrants\"). The Warrants may or may not have an exercise price close to $1.18 per share and shall be exercisable for a period that may vary and up to three (3) years from their date of issue.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the number of shares and warrants to be issued and the terms of the warrants. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using \"up to\" and \"may or may not,\" creating uncertainty about the actual consideration AJR will receive. It makes the agreement much more vague.",

Neither party shall have the right to use the corporate name of the other.",
                "changed_text": "AJR shall endeavor to avoid taking any action that directly harms XC's reputation, but is not responsible for actions taken by the Team or others unless explicitly directed by AJR's management.  Either party may, with prior written consent, use the corporate name of the other in promotional materials.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the protection of XC's reputation. The original text prohibits any action that could result in an adverse impact, while the modified version only requires AJR to endeavor to avoid directly harming XC's reputation, relieving them of responsibility for the Team's or others' actions and allowing use of the corporate name if there's approval. This approval clause directly contradicts the phrase prior which restricts both parties from doing so.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the term and its end date. The modified version adds \"may terminate\" and introduces uncertainty about the actual end date by stating it will be \"determined at a later time,\" creating a contradiction as to when the agreement actually terminates. It makes the term of the agreement ambiguous. This undermines the definiteness of the contract.",

                "original_text": "VS shall perform all Services under this Agreement as an independent contractor and not as an employee, partner or agent of PPD. As such, VS shall be solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, payroll deductions and similar items associated with compensation for its services under this Agreement as may be required by applicable law. VS acknowledges that as an independent contractor it will not be entitled to insurance or other benefits made available to employees of PPD.",
                "changed_text": "VS shall perform all Services under this Agreement as an independent contractor, except when VS is acting under the direct instruction and supervision of PPD. In such cases, VS may be considered a dependent contractor. VS shall be solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, payroll deductions and similar items associated with compensation for its services under this Agreement as may be required by applicable law, except where VS is deemed a dependent contractor, where PPD may withhold and remit taxes. VS acknowledges that as an independent contractor it will not be entitled to insurance or other benefits made available to employees of PPD, unless otherwise determined by PPD’s Human Resources department.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding VS's status as an independent contractor. The original text firmly establishes VS as an independent contractor. The modified text introduces the concept of VS being a \"dependent contractor\" under certain circumstances, creating ambiguity. Furthermore, it creates uncertainty regarding tax responsibilities and benefits eligibility, contradicting the original text and potentially leading to disputes over employment status and associated obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Further, VS represents and warrants that it has all of the necessary licenses, permits and/or registrations to perform the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the best of its knowledge. VS makes no guarantee that during the Term of this Agreement, all such licenses, permits and/or registrations are and shall remain current and in good standing and PPD should verify that VS has the necessary permits at the start of the project. VS is not responsible for being non-compliant should permits lapse during the course of the Work Order",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts VS's initial warranty. The original text states that VS warrants it has and will maintain all necessary licenses. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating VS makes \"no guarantee\" about maintaining licenses, shifting the responsibility of verification onto PPD, and removing VS’s responsibility when permits lapse. This weakens VS's initial guarantee and introduces the possibility of disputes if VS lacks proper authorization to perform the services.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, PPD may assign a Work Order to an affiliate or to Sponsor upon written notice to VS. In the event PPD assigns a Work Order to a Sponsor, VS agrees to release and forever discharge PPD from any and all claims that may arise out of the relevant Work Order after the effective date of such assignment. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by VS, PPD shall not be released from any liability or obligation under this Agreement upon assignment of any Work Order to an affiliate of PPD.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, PPD may assign a Work Order to an affiliate or to Sponsor with no prior notice to VS. In the event PPD assigns a Work Order to a Sponsor, VS may release PPD from any and all claims that may arise out of the relevant Work Order after the effective date of such assignment, or it may not. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by VS, PPD may or may not be released from any liability or obligation under this Agreement upon assignment of any Work Order to an affiliate of PPD. This will be determined by PPD",
                "explanation": "This change makes the assignment clause highly ambiguous and contradictory. The original text provides a clear framework for assignment and release of liability. The modified text introduces uncertainty by removing the requirement for notice and making both the release of liability upon assignment to a Sponsor and the continuing liability upon assignment to an affiliate subject to the discretion of PPD/VS. This could lead to disputes over whether VS is obligated to continue services under an assigned Work Order and whether PPD remains liable for any issues arising after the assignment. 'This will be determined by PPD' ",

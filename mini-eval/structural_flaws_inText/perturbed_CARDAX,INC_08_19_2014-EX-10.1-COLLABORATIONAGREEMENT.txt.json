                "original_text": "1.4 \"Affiliate\" shall mean, with respect to either Party, all entities which, directly or indirectly, are controlled by, control or are under common control with such Party. For purposes of this Agreement, the word \"control\" shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, including through ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting shares or interest of an entity; provided, however, with respect to CAPSUGEL, the term \"Affiliate\" shall be limited to entities who directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries are controlled by the parent of CAPSUGEL's direct parent entity and with respect to CARDAX the term \"Affiliate\" shall not include Cardax Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
                "changed_text": "1.4 \"Affiliate\" shall mean, with respect to either Party, all entities which, directly or indirectly, are controlled by, control or are under common control with such Party. For purposes of this Agreement, the word \"control\" shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to influence the direction of the management and policies of an entity; provided, however, with respect to CAPSUGEL, the term \"Affiliate\" shall be limited to entities who directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries are controlled by the parent of CAPSUGEL's direct parent entity and with respect to CARDAX the term \"Affiliate\" shall include Cardax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. regardless of control.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Affiliate' based on control, specifying a 50% ownership threshold for determining control. It explicitly excludes Cardax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as an affiliate of CARDAX. The modified version changes the definition of control to 'influence' rather than 'direct' and includes Cardax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as an affiliate of CARDAX 'regardless of control'. This directly contradicts the original definition, creating uncertainty about which entities are considered affiliates and the impact of control on affiliate status. It also brings uncertainty about what happens when decisions and control can be made by parties outside the original agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants each party an exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to jointly owned IP. The modified text changes this to a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license and grants decision-making power regarding protection and exploitation of joint IP solely to CAPSUGEL. This contradicts the initial agreement of joint ownership and shared control, creating uncertainty about the rights and obligations of each party regarding jointly developed intellectual property and also create a bias.",

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. Except in the event of (i) a Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct and/or (ii) a Party's breach of its confidentiality obligation, the total liability of one Party to the other Party (and its Affiliates) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Products, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute or otherwise, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, be limited to the amount of revenues it receives under this Agreement.",

The total liability of one Party to the other Party (and its Affiliates) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Products, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute or otherwise, shall not be limited, regardless of Applicable Law or any other factors. CAPSUGEL shall be liable for any damages it incurs, but CARDAX's liability shall be limited to the amount of revenues it receives under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits liability for both parties, with exceptions for gross negligence, willful misconduct, and confidentiality breaches. The modified text removes these exceptions and states that liability is *not* limited, however there are some caveats. It also creates an imbalance by removing the liability limitation for CAPSUGEL, while still limiting liability for CARDAX, which is contradictory. This could lead to disputes about the extent of liability and whether the original limitations still apply. The sentence 'CAPSUGEL shall be liable for any damages it incurs, but CARDAX's liability shall be limited to the amount of revenues it receives under this Agreement' contradicts the first sentence, because this statement says damages are not limited, implying punitive damages and consequential damages can be asked for.",

In consideration to the Agent for performance of its duties and obligations hereunder, the Agent shall be entitled to a Commission (\"Commission\"). Such Commission shall represent a percentage of the Program EBIT realized by the Roundup L&G Business which percentage shall be (i) for Program Years 2017 and 2018, 50% of the Program EBIT and (ii) for Program Years 2019 and thereafter, 50% of the Program EBIT in excess of $40MM (such $40MM threshold, the \"Commission Threshold\"). The parties agree that the Commission Threshold may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties following the inclusion or exclusion of either new or existing countries in the Included Markets, including Activated Included Markets, or Excluded Markets, as applicable.\n(b) Payment of Commission. Within thirty (30) days following the end of each month, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall determine whether a Commission becomes payable, i.e., whether the cumulative Program EBIT for the Program Year up to the preceding month equals an amount in excess of the First Commission Threshold. If so, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall by check or wire transfer, to the Agent's designated account for the payment of the applicable Commission pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 3.6(a) subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6(c).\n(c) Final Determination. Within fifteen (15) days following the end of each Program Year, the Agent shall deliver to Monsanto a Commission Statement which shall contain the final determination of the Commission due at the expiry of the Program Year and shall set forth any eventual adjustments, to the amounts paid up to the Agent under Section 3.6(b) during the preceding Program Year. If within fifteen (15) days following the receipt of such Commission Statement by the Agent, Monsanto does not provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the amount of the Commission for such Program Year shall be as provided thereon. If within such fifteen (15) days following receipt of such Commission Statement by Monsanto, Monsanto does provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the parties shall resolve such dispute in the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.",

The parties agree that the Commission Threshold may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties following the inclusion or exclusion of either new or existing countries in the Included Markets, including Activated Included Markets, or Excluded Markets, as applicable.\n(b) Payment of Commission. Within ninety (90) days following the end of each month, Monsanto, shall determine whether a Commission becomes payable, i.e., whether the cumulative Program EBIT for the Program Year up to the preceding month equals an amount in excess of the First Commission Threshold. If so, Monsanto, at its sole discretion, shall by check or wire transfer, to the Agent's designated account for the potential payment of the applicable Commission pursuant to a formula determined by Monsanto, not necessarily that set forth in Section 3.6(a) subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6(c).\n(c) Final Determination. Within thirty (30) days following the end of each Program Year, Monsanto shall deliver to the Agent a Commission Statement which shall contain the final determination of the Commission potentially due at the expiry of the Program Year and may not set forth any eventual adjustments, to the amounts paid up to the Agent under Section 3.6(b) during the preceding Program Year. If within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such Commission Statement by the Agent, Monsanto does not provide the Agent written notice, the amount of the Commission for such Program Year may or may not be as provided thereon, at Monsanto's sole discretion. If within such thirty (30) days following receipt of such Commission Statement by the Agent, Monsanto does provide the Agent written notice, Monsanto's determination supersedes any prior statement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed commission structure. The changed text introduces uncertainty by stating that the commission is 'may be entitled,' the percentage 'may be determined at Monsanto's discretion' and that payments are up to 'Monsanto at its sole discretion'. The change also extends the payment timeline from thirty to ninety days. The original states the Commission Statement is final if no objection is made within fifteen days, while the modified version gives Monsanto control over the final amounts irrespective of prior statements or lack of objection. These changes create a significant contradiction and uncertainty in the enforcement of commission payments, shifting all control to Monsanto.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines the Noncompetition Period as the term of the agreement plus two years, with exceptions for early termination. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the Noncompetition Period will be determined by Monsanto's discretion and range from zero to a perpetual period. This contradicts the original defined period. This introduces uncertainty about when and for how long the non-compete clause applies, potentially leading to disputes about the validity and enforceability of the agreement.",

The modified text removes these assurances, stating that Monsanto may or may not own the Industrial Property and making no representations about infringement or conflicts with other intellectual property rights. This introduces uncertainty about the legitimacy and legal protection of the trademarks associated with the products. This shift in language creates uncertainty for the Agent, as it's now unclear whether they can confidently market and sell Roundup Products without facing potential legal challenges related to intellectual property rights.",

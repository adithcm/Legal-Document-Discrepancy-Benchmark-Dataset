                "original_text": "a) \"CONTRACT PERIOD\" means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties and  terminating on May 31, 2016 unless sooner terminated under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "a) \"CONTRACT PERIOD\" means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties and terminating on May 31, 2014, unless mutually extended by both parties in writing. Berkshire has the sole option to extend the Contract Period in one-year increments up to May 31, 2020, upon written notice to Auriemma.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'CONTRACT PERIOD' sets a clear termination date. The modified version allows Berkshire to unilaterally extend the contract, contradicting the initial termination date and creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement, which affects Auriemma's obligations and exclusivity.",

                "changed_text": "b) Auriemma grants to Berkshire the exclusive right and license (the \"License Rights\") to use the Auriemma Identification during the Contract Period and throughout the Contract Territory solely in connection with the advertisement and promotion of Berkshire and the Financial Services; however, this exclusivity shall not prevent Auriemma from engaging in endorsements that Berkshire, at its sole discretion, deems to be non-competitive, regardless of the services or products endorsed.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants Berkshire exclusive rights to Auriemma's endorsement. The modified version introduces a loophole where Berkshire can unilaterally decide if Auriemma's other endorsements violate the exclusivity, creating uncertainty and potentially undermining the value of the exclusive rights granted to Berkshire. While seeming to favor Berkshire, it weakens the definition of 'exclusive,' as Auriemma's allowed activities are subject to Berkshire's vague and potentially shifting interpretation.",

Unless such  election is made in writing, all cash payments shall be made by check, drawn to the order of Auriemma or its designated entity or entities and  delivered to the address first stated above. Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire's receipt of the  applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month.",

Unless such election is made in writing, all cash payments shall be made by check, drawn to the order of Auriemma or its designated entity or entities and delivered to the address first stated above. The timing of payments is at the sole discretion of Berkshire. Any interest on late payments shall be determined at Berkshireâ€™s sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause outlines a clear payment schedule and late payment interest. The altered clause gives Berkshire sole discretion over the timing of payments, contradicting the implied payment deadlines established earlier and eliminates a guaranteed interest rate, creating ambiguity about when payments are due and if late fees apply. It introduces uncertainty and can lead to disputes over payment terms.",

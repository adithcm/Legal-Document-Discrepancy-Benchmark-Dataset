                "explanation": "The original text provides a seemingly fixed royalty percentage and stock conversion option. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that TDA may adjust the royalty percentage based on market conditions. This directly contradicts the initial fixed percentage and creates ambiguity. Furthermore, the option to convert royalties may be revoked by TDA, and the price can be decided by the board, which also can be exercised after the agreement, conflicting with the original terms of agreement.",

                "explanation": "Section 6.2 initially states that TDA should seize the sale of products after the agreement has been terminated, unless TDA is in default. It now says that TDA shall continue the sale post-termination, as long as TDA is in default. This is contradictory because the original states that TDA can only sale after the termination if it is not in default. With this change, there is an uncertainty about the obligations of TDA in using the right for promoting and the sales of Golf instruction related products",

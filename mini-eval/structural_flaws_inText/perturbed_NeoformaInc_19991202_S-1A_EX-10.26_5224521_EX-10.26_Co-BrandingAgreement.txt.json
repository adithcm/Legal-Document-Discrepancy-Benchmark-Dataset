This Agreement will automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless either Party notifies the other at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable, of its intention not to renew this Agreement (a \"Termination Notice\").",

This Agreement will automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), only if both Parties provide written consent to renew at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term. A lack of response from either party may be interpreted as a non-renewal decision.",

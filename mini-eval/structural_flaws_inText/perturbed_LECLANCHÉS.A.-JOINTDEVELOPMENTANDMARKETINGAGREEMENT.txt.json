                "explanation": "By adding the sentence \"However, information generally available to the public IS still considered Confidential Information if the disclosing party deems it to be,\" this creates a contradiction. The original text excludes generally available information, but the added sentence brings it back in under certain conditions. This creates uncertainty about what truly constitutes 'Confidential Information'.",

However, Leclanché reserves the right to change the payment terms on a case-by-case basis, with notification to Oak Ridge within 90 days of invoice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause established a clear 30-day payment term. By adding \"However, Leclanché reserves the right to change the payment terms on a case-by-case basis,\" we introduce contradiction and uncertainty. While it mentions notification within 90 days, it still conflicts with the initial 30-day requirement, leaving Oak Ridge unsure when payments are actually due.",

However, both parties can, by mutual consent, seek arbitration in Oak Ridge's home jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a contradiction to the governing law and jurisdiction clause. Initially, Zurich courts were given *exclusive* jurisdiction. The added sentence allows for arbitration in Oak Ridge's jurisdiction, thereby undermining the exclusivity granted to the Zurich courts and creating ambiguity as to the proper venue for dispute resolution.",

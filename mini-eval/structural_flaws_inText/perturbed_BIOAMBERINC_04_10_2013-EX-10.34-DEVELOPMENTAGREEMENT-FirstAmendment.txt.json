The modified version states that 'Bioamber is required to use MCC-17 as an alternative' which creates a contradiction. This introduces ambiguity around Bioamber's obligations regarding the use of MCC-17.",

This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9  of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology.

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber using best efforts to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the  biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof).

                "explanation": "The original text stated that Bioamber 'hereby agreeing to convert' the facility, and is required to put agreements in place to convert Sarnia Plant. The modified version replaces 'hereby agreeing to convert' with 'using best efforts to convert', and 'Bioamber will put in place agreements...' with 'Bioamber is not required to put agreements in place'. This creates a contradiction as it goes from a firm requirement to use best efforts, implying uncertainty in enforcement, also creating another sentence saying that 'Bioamber is not required to put agreements in place' contradicting 'Bioamber will put in place agreements'.",

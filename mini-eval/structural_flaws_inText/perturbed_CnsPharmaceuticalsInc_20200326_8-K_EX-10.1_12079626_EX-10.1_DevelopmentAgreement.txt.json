However, WPD is permitted to make disclosures if necessary to secure funding. This includes disclosing information to investors or banks.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines confidential information broadly, subject to exceptions. The modification adds an exception specifically for WPD to disclose confidential information to secure funding. This creates a contradiction because it's unclear whether WPD's funding disclosures are always an exception or only when 'necessary,' and 'necessary' is not defined. The \"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary\" clause originally only applied to CNS disclosures, but now its vague whether it applies to both CNS and WPD, creating ambiguity and uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original section states the agreement lasts until the Sublicense Agreement expires, unless terminated earlier according to the contract's terms. The modified version inserts a new sentence in 6.1 allowing either party to terminate the agreement at any time, with or without cause. This contradicts the original termination conditions in 6.2 that require a material breach or mutual agreement. The inclusion of 'notwithstanding the foregoing' only creates confusion as it is uncertain if the agreement is supposed to last for a specific duration.",

However, WPD's indemnification obligations shall only apply if CNS first provides WPD with documented proof of loss within 10 business days of first discovering such loss, even in instances of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Otherwise, CNS is solely responsible.",
                "explanation": "Section 8.1 is intended to mean WPD is responsible for issues caused by negligence but the new text is creating a strict process for indemnity to occur. This indemnity is no longer dependent on negligence, it is based on the time limit. The modified version states that WPD's indemnification applies only if CNS provides documented proof of loss within 10 business days of discovery, even for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This directly contradicts the intention that WPD is reliable no matter the loss because that is now dependent on proof within a small time limit. If CNS fails to meet this timeline, CNS is solely responsible. This creates conflict because the strict 10-day requirement undermines the broader indemnification obligation, especially for severe breaches like willful misconduct.",

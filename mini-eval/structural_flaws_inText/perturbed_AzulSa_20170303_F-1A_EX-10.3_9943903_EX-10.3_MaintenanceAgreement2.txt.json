                "original_text": "Unless otherwise defined, capitalised terms, singular or plural, used in this Amendment, shall have the same meaning ascribed thereto in the GMA.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms, singular or plural, shall have the meanings defined in Exhibit A attached hereto. If a capitalized term is used within this Amendment but is not defined herein or in Exhibit A, then the term shall have the same meaning ascribed thereto in the GMA.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction because it suggests that some capitalized terms are defined within the amendment itself (via Exhibit A), potentially overriding or conflicting with the definitions in the GMA. It becomes unclear whether Exhibit A takes precedence over GMA definitions and which definitions apply if both conflict.",

                "original_text": "This Amendment shall enter into force on the date of its signature by both Parties and, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Parties through a subsequent amendment to the GMA, shall remain in force for the term of the referenced GMA.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall enter into force on the date of its signature by both Parties and shall remain in force for an initial term of one (1) year, automatically renewing for successive one (1) year terms thereafter, unless either Party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties may terminate this Amendment at any time upon mutual written agreement, without penalty or cause.",
                "explanation": "The original text ties the amendment's duration to the referenced GMA. The modified text introduces an automatic renewal clause with a specific termination notice period, creating a contradiction. The amendment could potentially outlive the GMA based on its own renewal terms, or the GMA's termination could affect the amendment, creating enforcement uncertainty. While it includes a clause for mutual termination, the automatic renewal contradicts the direct link to the underlying GMA's duration.",

                "changed_text": "This Clause 4 shall survive termination or expiry of this Amendment indefinitely. However, either party may, upon providing 30 days written notice to the other party, terminate the confidentiality obligations outlined in this Clause 4.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the confidentiality clause survives termination for five years. The changed text first asserts that it survives 'indefinitely,' creating an immediate contradiction. Then, it adds a clause allowing either party to terminate the confidentiality obligations with 30 days' notice, further undermining the concept of indefinite survival and creating uncertainty about the actual duration of confidentiality.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion. All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. Upon written notification by the Licensor Source: NMF SLF I, INC., 10-12G/A, 1/15/2020 to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the license is 'non-exclusive' and requires the Licensor's consent for use beyond the specified terms. The modified version contradicts this by granting an 'exclusive' license, removing restrictions on use, and stating all rights granted become the 'exclusive property of the Licensee.' This creates a direct conflict regarding the extent of the Licensee's rights and the Licensor's control over the Licensed Mark.",

                "explanation": "The original text sets clear conditions for termination by either party, including specific notice periods and events triggering termination. The modified version contradicts this by stating the agreement expires immediately upon request from either party, eliminating all conditions and stating that the agreement shall not be terminable by any party under any condition. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration and conditions for termination, as the 'perpetual' term is undermined by the immediate termination clause, and no other terms exist",

Any agreement of transfer or encumbrance with such consent shall be valid at the discretion of the Licensee, and not the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly prohibits the Licensee from assigning or transferring rights without the Licensor's consent. The modified text directly contradicts this by granting the Licensee the unrestricted right to sublicense, assign, or transfer rights without any consent from the Licensor. The added sentence further reinforces this contradiction by stating that any agreement of transfer shall be valid at the discretion of the Licensee, not the Licensor, completely reversing the original intent and creating uncertainty about assignment rights.",

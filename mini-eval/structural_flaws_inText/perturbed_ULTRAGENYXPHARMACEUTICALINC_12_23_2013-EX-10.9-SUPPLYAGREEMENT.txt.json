                "original_text": "2) Cremer shall supply Ultragenyx exclusively with the Product worldwide. The aforesaid exclusivity is limited to [***] (collectively, the \"Field\"). Cremer may supply the Product to other customers outside of the Field.",
                "changed_text": "2) Cremer shall supply Ultragenyx exclusively with the Product worldwide. The aforesaid exclusivity is limited to [***] (collectively, the \"Field\"). Cremer may supply the Product to other customers outside of the Field. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cremer retains the right to supply the Product to select partners within the Field for research purposes, at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants Ultragenyx exclusive rights within a defined field. By adding the sentence about supplying 'select partners within the Field for research purposes, at its sole discretion', we introduce a contradiction. It becomes unclear whether Ultragenyx truly has exclusive rights, potentially leading to disputes.",

At the date of signing the Parties agree on a Price of €[***] per kilogram for the Product.",

At the date of signing the Parties agree on a Price of €[***] per kilogram for the Product. Cremer reserves the right to adjust the Price at any time due to unforeseen market conditions, with a 30-day written notice to Ultragenyx. Such price adjustment will take effect irrespective of Ultragenyx agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates a yearly price agreement with limitations on price increases. The added sentence allows Cremer to unilaterally adjust the price due to 'unforeseen market conditions,' overriding the previously agreed-upon limitations and potentially leading to disputes about price stability and predictability for Ultragenyx.",

However, Cremer is under no obligation to enter into such commercial supply agreement and may refuse to do so at its sole discretion without cause.",
                "explanation": "The original clause implies a requirement to enter into a commercial supply agreement if Ultragenyx obtains regulatory approval. The added sentence gives Cremer the option to refuse this agreement, directly contradicting the implicit obligation and creating uncertainty about the long-term supply relationship.",

                "original_text": "Wherever used in this Agreement with initial terms capitalized, the following terms shall have the following defined meanings:\n\n      \"CO-BRANDED PAGES\" means pages of the Snap Web Site, to be developed pursuant to Section 2.2  [CO-BRANDED PAGES] and hosted on the Snap Web Site, that display both the Snap Brand Features and the Sponsor Brand Features, along with such Sponsor Content, Snap Content and other content as the parties may agree upon.",
                "changed_text": "Wherever used in this Agreement with initial terms capitalized, the following terms may, at the discretion of Snap, have the following defined meanings:\n\n      \"CO-BRANDED PAGES\" means pages of either the Snap Web Site or the Sponsor Web Site, to be developed pursuant to Section 2.2 [CO-BRANDED PAGES], hosted on a web site chosen by Snap, that display either the Snap Brand Features or the Sponsor Brand Features, but not necessarily both, along with such Sponsor Content, Snap Content and other content as Snap deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'CO-BRANDED PAGES' as displaying both brands on the Snap website, developed jointly. The modified text introduces ambiguity by giving Snap sole discretion over definitions, allowing the pages to be on either site, displaying only one brand, and including content Snap deems 'appropriate', thus contradicting the initial definition and creating uncertainty about the co-branding commitment.",

Each party shall take, at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information (and in any event, at least reasonable measures) to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, and for a period determined at Snap's sole discretion thereafter, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any purpose of its own, other than what Snap considers in performance of this Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party. Each party shall take measures deemed adequate by their own internal policies to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text set a fixed 5-year confidentiality period. The modification makes the duration dependent on Snap's discretion, which contradicts the fixed term. Further, replacing 'at least reasonable measures' with 'measures deemed adequate by their own internal policies' lowers the standard of care and introduces ambiguity, potentially rendering the confidentiality provision unenforceable and contradicting the original intent of protecting confidential information for a defined period.",

Snap's consent may be withheld for any reason. However, Snap may, without Sponsor's consent, assign this Agreement or any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any entity.",
                "explanation": "The original clause required mutual agreement for assignment except in specific cases (affiliates, acquisitions). The modified version gives Snap sole authority to approve assignments, allows Snap to withhold consent for any reason (removing 'not to be unreasonably withheld'), and grants Snap unrestricted assignment rights, while denying the same to Sponsor. This creates a significant imbalance and contradicts the original intention of relatively equal assignment rights, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

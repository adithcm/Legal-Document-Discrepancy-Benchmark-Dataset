                "original_text": "Dolphin agrees to complete its photo-editing services within 14 days of receiving the original digital photo files. The completed files must meet DGT pre-defined standards for finished products;",
                "changed_text": "Dolphin agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete its photo-editing services within 14 days of receiving the original digital photo files. The completed files must meet DGT pre-defined standards for finished products; however, DGT may accept files not meeting such standards at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires Dolphin to complete services within 14 days and meet DGT's standards. The modified clause introduces 'commercially reasonable efforts,' weakening the obligation to complete within 14 days. Furthermore, DGT's ability to accept substandard work contradicts the initial requirement for files to meet predefined standards, creating uncertainty about the quality of work Dolphin is obligated to deliver.",

Dolphin shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement only after DGT fails to meet a material obligation hereunder and only after Dolphin has given DGT written notice of such failure and only after the DGT has not rectified such failure within 30 days of the notice.",
                "changed_text": "DGT shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement if Dolphin fails to meet its requirements and material obligation hereunder; however, DGT may terminate the agreement immediately at its sole discretion. Dolphin shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement only after DGT fails to meet a material obligation hereunder and only after Dolphin has given DGT written notice of such failure and only after the DGT has not rectified such failure within 30 days of the notice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates a process for DGT to terminate the agreement, requiring written notice and a 10-day rectification period for Dolphin. The modified version introduces an immediate termination clause for DGT, contradicting the original process. This weakens Dolphin's protection and creates uncertainty around the termination process.",

                "changed_text": "Dolphin shall charge DGT USD1.50 per delivered, completed photo. DGT shall have the right to audit Dolphin's invoices, and if DGT determines, in its sole discretion, that the price per unit is excessive, DGT will pay a price per unit that DGT deems reasonable. The price per unit shall be open to renegotiation - in response to competitive pricing pressures - upon receipt of written notice at any time by either party;",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a fixed price with renegotiation based on competitive pressures. The modified version grants DGT unilateral power to determine a 'reasonable' price if it deems the original price 'excessive.' This undermines the initial agreement on price and introduces ambiguity, giving DGT an unfair advantage and potentially leading to disputes about what constitutes a 'reasonable' price. It adds an ambiguous clause to the original agreement.",

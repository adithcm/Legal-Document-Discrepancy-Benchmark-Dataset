                "changed_text": "The Company may pay the Consultant basic remuneration for its services. The amount and timing of such payments, if any, will be determined at the sole discretion of the Company. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time determine to provide additional benefits, but is under no obligation to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed Consulting Fee of $10,000 per month. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that payment is at the Company's discretion, contradicting the earlier fixed fee agreement. This could lead to disputes over payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement states that if the Company terminates, they must provide a termination payment equal to the annual consulting fee. The modified agreement removes the need for the termination payment, directly contradicting the previously stated term and introducing uncertainty about the Company's obligations upon termination.",

The change introduces shared ownership subject to future agreements, which contradicts the original absolute ownership claim and introduces uncertainty about intellectual property rights.",

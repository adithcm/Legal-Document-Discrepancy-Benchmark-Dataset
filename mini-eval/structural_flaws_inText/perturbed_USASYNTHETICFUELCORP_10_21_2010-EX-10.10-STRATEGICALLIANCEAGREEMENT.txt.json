                "changed_text": "(a) Term. This Agreement shall be for an initial term of five (5) years, and any renewal shall require the express written consent of both parties, made no later than thirty days prior to the end of the current term.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the renewal of the agreement. The original text specifies automatic renewal, while the altered text stipulates explicit agreement for each renewal. This makes it ambiguous if the contract automatically renews, or does not without mutual party agreement, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the confidentiality agreement will continue for a period of 3 years. The revised text states that after the termination or expiration of the agreement, the information is no longer considered confidential. This creates a contradiction about the confidentiality duration.",

                "explanation": "The original text makes it mandatory that Global Energy issues additional shares to Oxbow. The altered text changes 'shall' to 'may' giving Global Energy the discretion of whether to issue shares or not, and also that the price protection extends to and includes the IPO. Now the altered text explicitly excludes the IPO from price protection.",

DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS\n1.1 The following definitions and interpretations shall apply to certain terms used in this Agreement:\n(a) Affiliate: A company is the Affiliate of another if either company owns directly or indirectly less than 50% but no less than 10% of its equity.",

DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS\n1.1 The following definitions and interpretations shall apply to certain terms used in this Agreement:\n(a) Affiliate: A company is the Affiliate of another if either company owns directly or indirectly no less than 50% of its equity.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' requires a minimum of 10% ownership. The modified version removes this minimum threshold, creating a contradiction. This could create disputes about whether certain entities qualify as affiliates for purposes of capacity allocation or other benefits under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text restricts capacity usage to carriers. The modified text removes this restriction, allowing non-carriers to use the capacity. This directly contradicts the initial statement and opens the door for uncertainty regarding who can access the network.",

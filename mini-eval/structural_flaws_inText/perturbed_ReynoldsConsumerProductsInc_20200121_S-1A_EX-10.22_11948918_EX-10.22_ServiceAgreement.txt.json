Provider or such Affiliate shall be solely responsible for the payment and provision of all wages, bonuses and commissions, employee benefits, including severance and worker's compensation, and the withholding and payment of applicable Taxes relating to such employment.",
                "changed_text": "Any employees of Provider or any of their Affiliates providing Services to Recipient under this Agreement will remain employees of Provider or such Affiliate and may be deemed to be employees of Recipient for certain purposes, as defined by the Recipient. Provider or such Affiliate shall be primarily responsible for the payment and provision of all wages, bonuses and commissions, employee benefits, including severance and worker's compensation, and the withholding and payment of applicable Taxes relating to such employment, except when explicitly agreed upon with Recipient.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the employment status of Provider's employees. The original text clearly states they will *not* be deemed employees of Recipient. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating they *may* be deemed employees for certain purposes, as defined by the Recipient which introduces ambiguity and potential disputes over liability for employment-related costs.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly excludes payments made to employees of the Provider from the fees that the Recipient is obligated to pay. By removing the exclusion, the modified clause implies that the Recipient *is* now responsible for the Provider's employee costs, directly contradicting the original intention and Section 5.2, which assigns responsibility for wages to the Provider. This change creates financial uncertainty and could lead to disputes over which party is responsible for employee-related payments.",

Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, upon 30 days' prior written notice of such termination; provided, (a) that, with respect to the Services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A, unless otherwise indicated therein, those Services may not be terminated independently except in accordance with an agreed Migration Plan and, (b) any unamortized costs associated with Provider's purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will be passed through to the Terminating Party.",

                "explanation": "The original text in Section 6.2 states that services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A may not be terminated independently except in accordance with an agreed migration plan and the terminating party will need to pay for unamortized costs. The modified version directly contradicts the above statements, saying that those services may be terminated independently without an agreed migration plan and the terminating party will not need to pay for unamortized costs, which results in uncertainty as to whether the services are dependent on migration plan and whether there's penalty for early termination.",

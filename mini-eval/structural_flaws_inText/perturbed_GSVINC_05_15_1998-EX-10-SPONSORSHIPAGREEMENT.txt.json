                "explanation": "Removing the \"good faith\" clause and replacing \"more prominently presented than any other 'competitive retailer's' banners or promotional placements\" with \"prominently presented\" weakens Excite's obligation. Also, changing the definition of 'competitive retailer' to include any online retailer broadens the scope, making it difficult for Excite to ensure prominence compared to every other retailer. This change weakens Client's protections within the contract.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will be payable in full' to '*may* be payable...subject to review and reconciliation,' the obligation to pay undisputed amounts within 30 days becomes uncertain. This contradicts the clear payment terms and could lead to payment delays or disputes.",

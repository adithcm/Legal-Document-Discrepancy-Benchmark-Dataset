                "original_text": "The ValueAct Group acknowledges that the ValueAct Designee shall have all of the rights and obligations, including fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders, of a director under applicable law and the Company's organizational documents while the ValueAct Designee is serving on the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2 shall limit any actions that may be taken by the ValueAct Designee acting solely as a director of the Company consistent with his fiduciary duties as a director of the Company (it being understood and agreed that the ValueAct Group and the ValueAct Affiliates shall not seek to do indirectly through the ValueAct Designee anything that would be prohibited if done by the ValueAct Group or the ValueAct Affiliates).",
                "changed_text": "The ValueAct Group acknowledges that while the ValueAct Designee serves on the Board, the Designee will generally adhere to the fiduciary duties expected of a director. However, the ValueAct Designee is primarily representing the interests of the ValueAct Group, and their actions will be viewed in consideration of those interests. The ValueAct Group and the ValueAct Affiliates may communicate with the ValueAct Designee regarding Company matters and provide direction to the ValueAct Designee, and such direction shall not be considered a breach of this agreement, provided it does not violate applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the ValueAct Designee has fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders. The modified text contradicts this by stating the Designee is primarily representing the interests of ValueAct, and ValueAct can provide direction. This creates uncertainty about the Designee's true obligations and introduces a potential conflict of interest.",

However, the General Counsel of the Company has the unilateral right to amend sections 8 (Compensation) and 12 (Notices) of this Agreement without prior written consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that amendments require written agreement from all parties. The modified text contradicts this by granting the Company's General Counsel the unilateral right to amend specific sections, creating ambiguity about how amendments are implemented. This could be exploited to make one-sided changes to important terms.",

However, regarding (ii) the ValueAct Designee's satisfaction of conditions, (iii) compliance by the ValueAct Group, and (iv) termination of the Designee's employment, the termination of this agreement is subject to the Board's approval, which they can grant or deny at their discretion. If termination is approved, the ValueAct Designee shall promptly offer to resign from the Board, and any committee of the Board on which he then sits (and, if requested by the Company, promptly deliver his written resignation to the Board (which shall provide for his immediate resignation) it being understood that it shall be in the Board's sole discretion whether to accept or reject such resignation).",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that termination is immediate if certain conditions are met. The modified version introduces a discretionary element by stating termination is subject to board approval for conditions (ii), (iii) and (iv), creating uncertainty about whether termination is truly automatic or subject to the Board's decision. This contradicts the original intent of immediate termination.",

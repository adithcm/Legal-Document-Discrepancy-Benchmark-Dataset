The modified text replaces 'will pay WGT the full amount invoiced within thirty (30) days' with 'will endeavor to pay WGT the full amount invoiced within a reasonable time frame', removing the defined deadline and replacing it with a vague term. This introduces a contradiction regarding payment terms, causing uncertainty regarding the agreed payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "Section 5.1 originally says 'The Term will automatically renew'. The modified text says 'The Term may renew'. The original text implies an automatic renewal assuming conditions are met. The change to 'may renew' introduces uncertainty on whether it will renew, even if the conditions are met, making it discretionary and contradicting the implied automation.",

                "explanation": "Section 14 originally implies that returns of defective products 'will' be permitted, provided the conditions are met. The modified text changes this to 'WGT may permit', introducing an element of discretion. Furthermore, removing the 'within thirty (30) days' deadline and replaced with 'The timing is determined upon WGT's own discretion' again creates an internal contradiction on the procedures, making it unclear under what circumstances returns are accepted and what the deadlines are.",

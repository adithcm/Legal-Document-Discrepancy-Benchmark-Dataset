Rogers may only exhibit licensed programs that licensor has provided written consent for exhibition.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the initial grant of rights by adding a requirement for written consent for each exhibited program.

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original License Period. The original text allows for a 90-day period or longer if agreed upon.

By allowing Rogers to adjust the fee based on 'consumer demand,' it creates ambiguity and uncertainty about the actual amount Licensor will receive, conflicting with the initial agreement of 50% of Retail Revenues.",

Delivery Schedule Based on the current requirements and this SOW, Seattle Software Developers estimates that this project will take around six [4] months of development, testing, and deployment. This estimate may change depending on unforeseen circumstances or requirements. We estimate that the website (Customer Portal) will take 3 months to complete because this will be the priority.",

Delivery Schedule Based on the current requirements and this SOW, Seattle Software Developers estimates that this project may or may not take around six [4] months of development, testing, and deployment. There is no guarantee for timeline. We estimate that the website (Customer Portal) might take 3 months to complete because this will be the priority.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides an estimated delivery schedule of six months. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that the project 'may or may not' take six months and provides no guarantee, directly contradicting the initial estimate and creating uncertainty about the project's timeline. This could lead to disputes if Pelican Delivers expects completion within six months, but Seattle Software Developers claims no commitment to that timeframe.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the fees for the project SHALL be $279,000.00, clearly outlining a payment schedule. The modified version uses 'approximately', 'may pay' and 'discretionary', which removes the obligation for Pelican Delivers to pay the stated amount and introduces uncertainty about the entire fee structure. This could enable disputes about whether Pelican Delivers is actually obligated to pay and when.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that only one dispensary is allowed per zip code, establishing exclusivity. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating that 'multiple dispensaries per zip code may be allowed', creating uncertainty. Further, original text has one dispensary per zip code till they stop paying or are removed. The modified text allows the next dispensary to claim the zip code, creating conflicting implications.",

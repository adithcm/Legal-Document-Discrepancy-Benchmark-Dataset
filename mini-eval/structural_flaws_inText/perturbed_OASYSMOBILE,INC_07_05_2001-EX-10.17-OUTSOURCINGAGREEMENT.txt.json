                "explanation": "The original definition limits the application to the English version in object code and only commercially available updates. The changed text broadens it to include all language versions, source code, all documentation, and all updates (including non-commercial ones).

Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of the other party; (ii) was in the other party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained by the other party either directly or indirectly from the disclosing party; (iii) is lawfully disclosed to the other party by a third party without restriction on disclosure; or (iv) is independently developed by the other party. HSNS shall not disclose the results of any Application benchmark tests to any third party without E.piphany's prior written approval. The parties agree to hold each other's Confidential Information in confidence for a period of five (5) years after disclosure of the Confidential Information or for a period of two (2) years after termination of this Agreement, whichever is earlier. The parties agree, unless required by law (in which event, the receiving party will notify the disclosing party of such requirement in sufficient time for the disclosing party to seek a protective order or take similar action), not to make each other's Confidential Information available in any form to any third party for any purpose, except that access to and the use of Confidential Information may be provided to those third parties that: (i) provide services to the recipient of Confidential Information; (ii) have a need to use and access such Confidential Information in providing such services; and (iii) are bound by an obligation of confidentiality at least as restrictive as the confidentiality restrictions of this Agreement. Each party agrees to take all reasonable steps required to ensure that Confidential Information is not disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents in violation of the terms of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause prohibits HSNS from disclosing benchmark test results without approval. The changed text permits disclosure without approval. The original text limits the duration of confidentiality to five years or two years after termination. The altered text extends this duration indefinitely, creating an inconsistency. It originally restricted information access to third parties; the modified version permits unrestricted third-party access, creating another conflict.",

Except as provided in Section 2.1 above, and unless otherwise agreed and specified in Exhibit A, all amounts due and owing by HSNS shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of E.piphany's invoice. Overdue payments shall accrue a late payment charge at the lesser of one and one half percent (1 1/2%) per month or the maximum rate allowed under applicable law. All payments made hereunder are non-cancelable and non-refundable. All fees are payable in U.S. dollars and shall be payable to E.piphany, Inc. by company check, or via wire transfer to the following account: Silicon Valley Bank - Santa Clara, ABA: 121140399, Account: 3300109833, Money Market.",

Late payment charges do not apply. All payments made hereunder are fully cancelable and fully refundable at any time. All fees are payable in Monopoly money and shall be payable to any random third party at any location.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the original payment terms. Instead of requiring payment within 30 days, it states that payments are merely encouraged. The original clause specified late payment charges, while the revised version eliminates them. It also says payments are now 'fully cancelable and fully refundable,' conflicting with the original's 'non-cancelable and non-refundable.' Furthermore, it replaces the U.S. dollar payment method to 'Monopoly money' and to 'any random third party,' completely invalidating the original payment structure.",

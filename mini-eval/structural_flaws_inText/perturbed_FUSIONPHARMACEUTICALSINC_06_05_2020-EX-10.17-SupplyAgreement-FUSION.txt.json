For supply of Product, CPDC shall invoice FUSION [***]. CPDC shall send such invoices to:\n\nAddress:\n\n270 Longwood Rd. South Hamilton, Ontario L8P 0J6 Canada [***]\n\nFUSION shall pay such invoice within [***] of receipt of the invoice in accordance with the Supply Agreement",

For supply of Product, CPDC shall invoice FUSION [***]. CPDC shall send such invoices to:\n\nAddress:\n\n270 Longwood Rd. South Hamilton, Ontario L8P 0J6 Canada [***]\n\nFUSION may pay such invoice within [***] of receipt of the invoice, subject to FUSION's internal payment policies and any disputes raised in good faith. Payment terms shall ultimately be determined by mutual agreement, and late payments shall not incur penalties.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates payment within a specific timeframe ([***] days). The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating payment is 'subject to FUSION's internal payment policies' and 'mutual agreement,' effectively contradicting the original fixed payment timeline. This creates uncertainty about when payment is actually due and whether late fees apply, conflicting with the initial obligation.",

Following the Term, this Supply Agreement shall automatically renew for successive periods of one (1) year (each a \"Renewal Term\"), unless a Party delivers written notice of non-renewal to the other Party [***] prior to the end of the applicable term. Renewal of this agreement requires mutual written consent from both parties, irrespective of any prior automatic renewal terms. The Term, Initial Renewal Term and Renewal Terms shall be collectively referred to as the \"Term\".",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes automatic renewal with a notice period. The modified clause introduces a contradictory requirement for 'mutual written consent' for renewal, regardless of the original automatic renewal. This creates ambiguity; it's unclear if the agreement auto-renews or requires active consent for each renewal, potentially leading to disputes.",

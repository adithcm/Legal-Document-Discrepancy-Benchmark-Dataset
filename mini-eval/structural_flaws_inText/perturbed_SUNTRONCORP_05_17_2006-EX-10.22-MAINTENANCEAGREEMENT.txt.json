Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent acknowledges and agrees that the Investor's obligation to make Required Capital Contributions hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 during the term of this Agreement. The Agent further acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether other \"Events of Default\" (as defined therein) have occurred and are continuing under the Financing Agreement, in no event shall the Investor be obligated to make any Required Capital Contributions hereunder if the Borrowers have fully complied with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of the applicable Fiscal Quarter for the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable).",

                "explanation": "Section 2 originally requires the Investor to make capital contributions under certain conditions. The modified version makes these contributions optional, contradicting the initial mandatory nature. This introduces significant ambiguity regarding the investor's commitment to providing capital. Furthermore, it contradicts with section 10 (a) \"if the Investor shall fail to pay, when and as due, any Required Capital Contribution\", since, according to the updated section 2, the Required Capital Contribution is not due at any time.

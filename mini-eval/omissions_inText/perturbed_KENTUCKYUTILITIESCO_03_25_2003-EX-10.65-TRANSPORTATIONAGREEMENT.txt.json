                "original_text": "1.1 TRANSPORTATION QUANTITY - shall mean the maximum daily quantity of gas which Transporter agrees to receive and transport on a firm basis, subject to Article II herein, for the account of Shipper hereunder on each day during each year during the term hereof, which shall be 51,000 dekatherms. Any limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery shall be as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.",

Any limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery shall be as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific quantity (51,000 dekatherms), Article 1.1 now lacks a defined maximum daily quantity. This creates an inconsistency because Article II still refers to 'Transportation Quantity,' implying a fixed value exists, while it is no longer defined in Article 1.1, leading to uncertainty about the actual amount of gas to be transported.",

To the extent that no new measurement facilities are installed to provide service hereunder, measurement operations will continue in the manner in which they have previously been handled. In the event that such facilities are not operated by Transporter or a downstream pipeline, then responsibility for operations shall be deemed to be Shipper's.",

To the extent that no new measurement facilities are installed to provide service hereunder, measurement operations will continue in the manner in which they have previously been handled. In the event that such facilities are not operated by Transporter or a downstream pipeline, then responsibility for operations shall be deemed to be Shipper's.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly references the 'General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff Volume No. 1' for quality and measurement specifications. The modified text replaces this with a vague reference to 'industry standards.' This creates a contradiction because other sections of the contract might still refer back to the FERC Gas Tariff for specific details, while Article V no longer clearly mandates adherence to it for quality and measurement.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'In addition to the warranties set forth in Article IX of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff', the modified text implies that the listed warranties are exhaustive. However, other sections of the contract, like Article VIII, may still state that the agreement is subject to the General Terms and Conditions, which include additional warranties. This omission creates uncertainty about whether Article XI covers all warranties or if others from the General Terms and Conditions also apply.",

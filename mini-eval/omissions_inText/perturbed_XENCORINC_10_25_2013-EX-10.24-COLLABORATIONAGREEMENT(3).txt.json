                "changed_text": "1.19 \"FTE\" shall mean a person working at BII.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"FTE\" includes specific details about the allocation of time and effort. Removing this definition creates ambiguity, especially when Section 5.2.3 discusses Technology transfer support of [...***...] FTEs of BII for a period of [...***...] for each of the [...***...] FTEs. The modified definition does not explain how to qualify a person to be an FTE, which can lead to contradictions in the actual resource allocation during the project. This could result in disputes over the value of Technology transfer.",

The Parties are in agreement, that in the first instance they will agree on preliminary specifications which shall then be fixed to final Specifications in accordance with Section 2.5.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'set forth in Appendix 6' directly contradicts the fact that Appendix 6 does not exist. Section 2.5 refers to specifications. Removing the reference to Appendix 6 makes it unclear where to find the relevant specifications, leading to enforcement problems. There are references to the specification in other sections.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific interest rate creates a contradiction because later sections and subsections still reference the \"Total Amount\", which originally includes a defined interest component. Without the rate defined in Section 3.1.2, it's unclear how this interest component should be calculated, creating uncertainty in the financial obligations of the parties. Appendix 7 is missing.",

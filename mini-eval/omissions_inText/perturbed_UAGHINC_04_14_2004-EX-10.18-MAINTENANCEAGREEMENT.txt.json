In each of the first twelve months of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Provider $40,000 per month in exchange for the Services (the \"Service Fee\"). Upon each anniversary of the commencement of this Agreement, the Service Fee shall be increased by a percentage that reflects the actual increases in the Provider's cost of providing the Services, if any. All materials and labor required to provide any Repairs or any other services or other work not specified in Section 2.1(a) hereof requested by the Company shall be billed to the Company, in addition to the Service Fee as adjusted, at a rate equal to the Provider's actual cost plus 10% service/overhead fee.",

In each of the first twelve months of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Provider a monthly fee in exchange for the Services (the \"Service Fee\"). Upon each anniversary of the commencement of this Agreement, the Service Fee shall be subject to renegotiation. All materials and labor required to provide any Repairs or any other services or other work not specified in Section 2.1(a) hereof requested by the Company shall be billed to the Company, in addition to the Service Fee as adjusted, at a rate to be determined.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific dollar amount and the method of calculating increases to the Service Fee, while keeping the reference to a 'Service Fee', this creates uncertainty. The 'Service Fee' is still referenced in the context of additional charges, but the initial fee is now undefined and 'subject to renegotiation', while the cost plus 10% is now 'to be determined.'",

The Company shall not sell, transfer or otherwise attempt to convey or dispose of any part of the Fiber Ring Assets, other than sales and leases of capacity or of individual fiber strands in the ordinary and usual course of business unless the Provider consents to such transaction, which consent will not be withheld if, (a) the proposed transferee consents in writing to the assumption of all obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including those obligations to be undertaken under other agreements pursuant to Section 3.3, and (b) all governmental approvals (under City Rights Agreements or otherwise) have been obtained, with the Provider having the right (if it elects) to coordinate such efforts if it is the counterparty under such agreements requiring approval (with the Company to pay the reasonable costs of doing so).",

The Company shall not sell, transfer or otherwise attempt to convey or dispose of any part of the Fiber Ring Assets, other than sales and leases of capacity or of individual fiber strands in the ordinary and usual course of business unless the Provider consents to such transaction. The Provider's consent will be subject to internal review.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific conditions under which consent cannot be withheld, while still requiring consent, the conditions for transfer become unclear. The statement 'The Provider's consent will be subject to internal review' is vague and gives the Provider broad discretion to deny consent, contradicting the prior clause which defined when consent *cannot* be withheld, which could cause issues.",

The Provider will obtain and maintain appropriate liability insurance in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit for accidents or occurrences which cause bodily injury, death or property damage related to the performance of the Services. The insurance policy willname the Company as an additional insured. The Provider will provide the Company with a certificate of insurance issued to evidence such coverage. Such certificate will provide that there shall be no cancellation, non-renewal, or modification of such coverage without thirty days' prior written notice to the Company.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specified insurance amount ($1,000,000) creates ambiguity. While the Provider is still required to maintain 'appropriate' liability insurance, the lack of a defined amount leads to uncertainty and potential disputes, especially since it no longer has any conditions for changes to that insurance.",

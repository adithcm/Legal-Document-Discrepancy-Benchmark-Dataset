                "explanation": "By removing the detailed list of what 'ENDORSEMENT' includes (nickname, initials, autograph, etc.), but later sections still refer to the Endorsement, the contract introduces ambiguity. It's unclear what specific aspects of Nantz's persona the Company has rights to use.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states Nantz will be a full-time employee. The change to 'collaborate' removes this clause while sections on compensation and stock options imply an employee status. This creates a contradiction regarding Nantz's employment status which impacts obligations such as benefits and tax implications.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires Nantz to be a voting member of the Board of Directors. The modified text removes this obligation. However, later sections on insurance (Directors and Officers Insurance) assume he is a director. This creates a contradiction.",

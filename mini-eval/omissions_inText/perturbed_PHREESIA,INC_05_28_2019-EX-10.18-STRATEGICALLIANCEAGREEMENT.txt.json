                "explanation": "By removing the specific mention of 'Bank Card Merchant Rules and Regulations' and stating they are incorporated, the definition becomes vague. Later sections referring to 'Bank Rules' will lack a precise meaning, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Removing specific mentions of 'applicable specifications set forth in this Agreement and the Documentation' creates a contradiction. While section 21.3 now requires conformity, the basis for determining conformity is less clear. This makes it more difficult to prove a breach of warranty.",

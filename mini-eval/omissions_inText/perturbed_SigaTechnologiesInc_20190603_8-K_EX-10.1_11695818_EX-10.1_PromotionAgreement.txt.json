                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Product\" means the FDA-approved oral formulation of TPOXXÂ® (tecovirimat) for use in the Field, or any oral formulation of tecovirimat for use in the Field for which a Regulatory Authority grants Drug Approval to SIGA in a country or jurisdiction in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "\"Product\" means any formulation of tecovirimat for use in any capacity in any country or jurisdiction in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies an 'FDA-approved oral formulation' for 'use in the Field'. By changing it to 'any formulation of tecovirimat for use in any capacity', the definition is broadened considerably. The subsequent clauses referencing 'Product in the Field' are now inconsistent as the definition no longer requires it to be within the initial defined scope.",

                "explanation": "By changing it to \"The Parties agree that all information related to this agreement can be publicly disclosed\", it contradicts Section 10.1 and 10.2, in which there is confidentiality requested by both parties. It also makes the contract vague as to what is considered public and non-public, leading to conflicts.",

This creates inconsistencies with sections where material compliance with regulatory requirements is expected for obtaining approvals, safety standards, and other requirements for the product.",

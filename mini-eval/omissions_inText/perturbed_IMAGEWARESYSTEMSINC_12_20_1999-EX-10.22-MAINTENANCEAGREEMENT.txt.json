DEFINITIONS\n\nThe terms defined in this Section shall have the meaning as follows:\n\n\n\nFIRST LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means MORPHO will require the Kuwait Government to contact MORPHO maintenance personnel for all problems associated with the installed Force Field PSS System. MORPHO will respond with fixes and/or workarounds to keep the system operational. MORPHO personnel may document any software problems and refer them to XIMAGE for additional fixes or patches.\n\nSECOND LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means if Morpho's personnel can not start or keep the system operational because of software problems, XIMAGE should be contacted to provide all documented and replicated software Errors. XIMAGE will make best efforts to support Morpho by any means available. Such an undertaking is made in the knowledge that a telecommunications line between the site and XIMAGE may not be in existance.\n\nPROGRAM means ForceField PSS software developed by XIMAGE including the Sybase and Focus software and includes all software provided under the Maintenance Agreement.\n\nPROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS means the specifications published by XIMAGE for a particular version of the Program (if no such specification is available, then the relevant documentation for a particular version of the Program).\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE shall mean the Date of Installation of the PSS in Kuwait, i.e. December 10, 1993.\n\nERROR means any material failure to operate in accordance with the program specifications delivered from the specifications appended to the base agreement. Error includes malfunctions and defects.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definitions of 'PROGRAM', 'PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS', 'EFFECTIVE DATE', and 'ERROR', several sections that reference these terms (such as section 3 which references 'Error' or sections referencing the 'Program') become ambiguous and unenforceable. The omission creates an internal contradiction because those sections are predicated on clear definitions that no longer exist.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specifics of a '24 hour a day reporting facility' and a '30 minute' response time, makes the contract vague. Section 16 which references Section 8 regarding disputes is now less specific. This introduces uncertainty because the definition of a 'timely manner' is now undefined, and subjective.",

                "explanation": "Removing the language 'basic Monthly Maintenance Charges, for a sixty (60) day term under this Agreement' and replacing it with 'a reasonable amount under this Agreement' creates uncertainty. There is no objective determination of what that amount is. Without specifying a calculation or specific monetary amount, the clause becomes unenforceable and contradicts the intent of limiting liability.",

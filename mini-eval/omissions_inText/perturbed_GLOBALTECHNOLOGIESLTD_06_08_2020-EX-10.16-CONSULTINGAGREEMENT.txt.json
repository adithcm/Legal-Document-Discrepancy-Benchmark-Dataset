                "original_text": "5. COMPENSATION TO CONSULTANT. As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition. The Consultant will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the Consultant's performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. The Company will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf. The Consultant agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this Agreement. The Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific amount of $250,000,00 cash compensation, while still indicating that compensation will be paid, introduces uncertainty regarding the compensation amount. This creates a contradiction because there's an obligation to pay compensation but no defined amount, leaving room for dispute and making enforcement ambiguous. The subsequent mention of additional compensation further muddies the water, as it is unclear what the 'additional' compensation is added to.",

In and for valuable consideration, the Company hereby agrees that Consultant may introduce (whether by written, oral, data, or other form of communication) the Company to one or more opportunities, including, without limitation, existing or potential investors, lenders, borrowers, trusts, natural persons, corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, unincorporated businesses, sole proprietorships and similar entities (an \"Opportunity\" or \"Opportunities\"). The Company further acknowledges and agrees that the identity of the subject Opportunities, and all other information concerning an Opportunity (including without limitation, all mailing information, phone and fax numbers, email addresses and other contact information) introduced hereunder are the property of Consultant, and shall be treated as confidential information by the Company, it affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns. The Company shall not use such information, except in the context of any arrangement with Consultant in which Consultant is directly and actively involved, and never without Consultant's prior written approval. The Company further agrees that neither it nor its employees, affiliates or assigns, shall enter into, or otherwise arrange (either for it/him/herself, or any other person or entity) any business relationship, contact any person regarding such Opportunity, either directly or indirectly, or any of its affiliates, or accept any compensation or advantage in relation to such Opportunity except as directly though Consultant, without the prior written approval of Consultant. Consultant is relying on the Company's assent to these terms and their intent to be bound by the terms by evidence of their signature.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"in which Consultant is directly and actively involved\", the Company is now blocked from using information about Opportunities, even if the consultant is NOT directly and actively involved. This creates a contradiction because the earlier text indicates opportunities being confidential and belonging to consultant implying control, and the removed text modifies the extent of said control now. Also, removing the phrase \"shall be treated as confidential information by the Company\" means that the company has no legal reason to keep such information confidential.",

                "original_text": "REVENUE SHARE/FEE: Commencing on March 1, 2020 and thereafter, the Parties shall share revenue generated from Customer's consumer offerings, including but not limited to its content, technology, traffic, data, websites, apps, videos and podcasts, without offset and regardless of which Party is responsible for securing such revenue, as per the attached Schedule 1.",
                "changed_text": "REVENUE SHARE/FEE: Commencing on March 1, 2020 and thereafter, the Parties shall share revenue generated from Customer's consumer offerings. Details of revenue sharing are subject to separate agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Schedule 1' and stating 'subject to separate agreement', while Schedule 1 still exists, creates a contradiction. Schedule 1 defines revenue share, but this section suggests it might be governed elsewhere, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "original_text": "RECONCILIATION/PAYMENT TERMS: The Parties agree to reconcile revenue numbers and the revenue share calculations no later than 10 days following the end of each calendar month during which the Services were rendered. Subject to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment shall be made to the appropriate Party net 30 days from the end of the calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "RECONCILIATION/PAYMENT TERMS: The Parties agree to reconcile revenue numbers. Payment shall be made to the appropriate Party based on standard business practices.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific deadline for reconciliation (10 days) and payment terms (net 30 days), the contract becomes vague. Schedule 1 mentions revenue share but does not outline reconciliation, while Exhibit B states that parties should reconcile revenue numbers, without the date to do so. While the original 'Exhibit A' has been superseded, the changed text lacks a specific deadline that creates uncertainty in enforcement and contradicts standard accounting practices if the reconciliation date has not been settled yet.",

                "original_text": "CONFLICTING TERMS: The Schedule 1 shall supersede the flat fee and Initial Revenue Share set forth in Exhibit A. The payment term provision above shall supersede the payment term provision set forth in Exhibit A.",
                "changed_text": "CONFLICTING TERMS: This Exhibit B supersedes any conflicting terms in previous agreements.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to Schedule 1's precedence over Exhibit A, while not expressly stating that Schedule 1 is no longer in effect, the contract introduces ambiguity. Schedule 1 is still referenced earlier in the document, and now, that this section has been omitted, it is implied that Exhibit B as a whole replaces all prior agreements, including its own Schedule 1, which creates a contradiction that causes further legal uncertainty.",

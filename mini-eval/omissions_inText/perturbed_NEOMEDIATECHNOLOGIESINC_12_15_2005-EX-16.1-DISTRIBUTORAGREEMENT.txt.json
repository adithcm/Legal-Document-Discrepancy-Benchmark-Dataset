PPG SHANGHAI desires DISTRIBUTOR to market and sell PPG's \"Deltron\" and          \"ACS\" brand products, as hereinafter defined in Section 2 (the          \"Products\"), to the repair chain shops in P.R.China as listed on          Appendix 4 (the \"Territory\");",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to \"Deltron\" and \"ACS\" as defined Products in Section 2 and Appendix 4, the definition of 'Products' becomes ambiguous. Subsequent sections relying on this clear definition, such as those relating to pricing, sales targets, and warranties, now lack clarity, leading to potential disputes over which products are covered under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to Appendix 3, which presumably contains the specific sale targets, creates ambiguity. Without the defined targets, the clause becomes unenforceable, as there's no objective metric to measure Distributor's performance against. This omission contradicts later sections (e.g., 8(e)) that mention incentives based on target achievement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the mention of Appendix 2 (PPG logo), the contract creates uncertainty about which specific trademarks the distributor is authorized to use. This could lead to disputes if PPG SHANGHAI later claims the distributor is misusing trademarks not explicitly approved. This directly impacts the distributor's ability to market and sell the products effectively, and is a contradiction of what a limited liscence entails.",

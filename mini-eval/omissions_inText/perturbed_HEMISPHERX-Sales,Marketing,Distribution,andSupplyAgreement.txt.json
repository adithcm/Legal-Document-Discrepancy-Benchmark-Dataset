                "changed_text": "\"Product Unit\" means a vial of Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived)",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific quantity of international units (I.U.) contained in the product unit, and only designating 'a vial', creates ambiguity. Other clauses referencing 'Product Unit' now lack clarity regarding the actual quantity being transacted, affecting pricing, forecasting, and inventory obligations. This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

If exercised after year 3, HEMISPHERX will pay SCIEN two (2) times the Product sales for the preceding 12 months.' to 'If exercised, HEMISPHERX will pay SCIEN based on an evaluation to be determined' makes the actual buyout process vague. While the process of buying out the agreement remains, the method to properly value such remains unclear. There is no indication as to what 'evaluation to be determined' entails.",

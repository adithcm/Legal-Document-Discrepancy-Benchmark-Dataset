                "original_text": "1.8 \"Director of Operations\" has the meaning ascribed to it in Subparagraph 4.1 and on SCHEDULE 1. 1.9 \"Managing Director\" has the meaning ascribed to it in Subparagraph 4.3 and on SCHEDULE 1.",
                "changed_text": "1.8 \"Director of Operations\" means the individual responsible for overseeing daily restaurant operations. 1.9 \"Managing Director\" means the individual responsible for the financial performance of the Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Subparagraph 4.1 and 4.3 and Schedule 1, the modified text offers vague, new definitions of 'Director of Operations' and 'Managing Director' that conflict with the detailed descriptions in the original subparagraphs and Schedule 1. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as the specific responsibilities outlined elsewhere are now ambiguous.",

During the year immediately following the expiration of one half of the Term of this Agreement (e.g., in the 11th year of a 20 year term), the Franchisee shall remodel, improve and alter the exterior of the Franchised Restaurant to conform with the Current Image in effect during the prior year .",
                "changed_text": "5.3.3 CURRENT IMAGE. The Franchisee may, at their discretion, consider minor aesthetic updates to the Franchised Restaurant.",
                "explanation": "By changing the text from 'shall remodel' to 'may, at their discretion, consider', the mandatory obligation to conform with the Current Image is removed. However, Section 5.4, regarding signs, still states, 'The Franchisee agrees to maintain and display signs conforming to the Current Image.' This creates a contradiction because the Franchisee is obligated to maintain signs conforming to an image they are no longer strictly required to maintain through remodeling. Also, in section 7.2, '...reconstruct the building within a reasonable time to reflect the then Current Image of Burger King Restaurants...'. The original section dictates the franchised restaurant remodeling at a very specific time, but the changed text makes it discretionary.",

Pursuant to the terms of the Ad Fund Agreement dated March 14, 1997 between the Franchisee and BKC, the Franchisee shall expend monthly, in the country where the Franchised Restaurant is located, monies for advertising, sales promotion and public relation services for he benefit of Burger King Restaurants in the country where the Franchised Restaurant is locate, including creative, production, media and clearance costs of advertising and sales promotion materials, and marketing 12 research expenses directly related to the development and evaluation of the effectiveness of advertising and sales promotion.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates Franchisee to spend monies on advertising, sales promotion and public relation services per Ad Fund Agreement. The changed text makes contributions discretionary. This omission creates a contradiction with Section 9.2.2, which states '...BKC shall have the right to terminate the Ad Fund Agreement pursuant to its terms and require that the Franchisee pay to BKC or its designee...an amount equal to the amount calculated by applying the advertising percentage stated in SCHEDULE 1 to the Gross Sales for the preceding calendar month.' Now, the Franchisee is given encouragement to contribute to advertising, but if BKC terminates the Ad Fund Agreement then the franchisee has to pay a percentage. Contradiction created.",

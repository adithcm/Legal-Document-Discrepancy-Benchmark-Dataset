The Royalty Fee will be the following amounts: (a) the greater of (i) twenty percent (20%) of Gross Revenues on insurance policies in their initial term, or (ii) the Minimum Royalty (defined below); and (b) fifty percent (50%) of Gross Revenues on policies in their renewal terms and policies written for existing customers on the same risk profile within a one-year period of the cancellation of their existing policy (also known as \"re-writes\").",

                "explanation": "By removing 'twenty percent (20%)' from the initial royalty calculation, the modified text contradicts the basic calculation method. The initial royalty becomes ill-defined (greater of (i) Gross Revenues or (ii) Minimum Royalty) while renewal policies still have a defined fee percentage of 50%. This contradiction creates a situation where initial royalty calculations are unclear but renewal royalties are not, leading to enforcement uncertainty and potential legal disputes regarding the payable royalty amount.",

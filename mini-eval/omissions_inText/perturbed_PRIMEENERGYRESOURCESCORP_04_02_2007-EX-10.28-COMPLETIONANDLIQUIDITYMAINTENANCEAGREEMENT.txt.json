For purposes ofthis Agreement, Project Completion shall consist oftwo components and be defined as: A) each Project Field in the Development Project having all planned in-field and flow pipelines, caissons, platforms and production facilities for all the wells in such Project Field, for which Guaranty has loaned funds, installed and operationalsuch that the production from all such wells can be transported to a readily available sales point for naturalgas.

B) a pipeline connection to a major gas transportation network.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirements (permits, liens, cost payments, etc.) for Project Completion, the definition becomes vague. Later sections that refer to 'Project Completion' are now ambiguous because the term's meaning has been drastically simplified here, introducing uncertainty about Prime's obligations.",

                "original_text": "As consideration for Guaranty entering into the Credit Agreement to provide such loans for the Development Project and to ensure Project Completion. Prime absolutely and unconditionally warrants to Guaranty to fund the payment to Offshore of all costs that exzeed the available commitments under the Credit Agreement, including interest, for Project Completion. In the event Offshore is in Default under Section 7.1(f), (g), (h) and/or (i) ofthe Credit Agreement, then Prime absolutely and unconditionally warrants to Guaranty\" the assumption of all costs for Project Completion.",

Prime warrants to Guaranty to fund payments to Offshore under mutually agreed terms. In the event Offshore is in Default, Prime warrants to Guaranty the assumption of costs under terms to be determined.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'absolutely and unconditionally' clause and 'all costs that exceed available commitments...for Project Completion' significantly weakens Prime's financial guarantee. The addition of 'under mutually agreed terms' and 'under terms to be determined' creates a contradiction. The original intent implies a hard commitment, which is then undermined, especially when other sections depend on the full strength of Prime's guarantee for the Project's success. This shifts risk onto Guaranty.",

                "changed_text": "Prime will maintain liquidity during the term of the Credit Agreement. The level of liquidity shall be determined by mutual agreement between Prime and Guaranty.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific liquidity requirements ($25,000,000 cash/equivalents and revolver availability), the obligation becomes vague. This is a contradiction because other parts of the agreement likely depend on a specific, verifiable liquidity level to ensure Prime can meet its financial obligations. 'Mutual agreement' creates uncertainty and shifts the burden of defining liquidity to future negotiation, which may conflict with the original intent.",

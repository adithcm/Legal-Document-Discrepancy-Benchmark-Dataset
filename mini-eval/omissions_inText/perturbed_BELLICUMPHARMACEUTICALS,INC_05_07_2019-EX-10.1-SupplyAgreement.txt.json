Each Party will use [...***...] to provide additional notice by email but the failure to provide such notice will not affect the validity of any such notice.

Either Party may change its address by giving the other notice thereof in the manner provided herein.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specifics of how communications are deemed effective when sent by overnight courier or certified/registered mail, but keeping the statement that either party can change their address, the contract becomes contradictory. It's unclear how a change of address is 'given' if the defined methods of notice are no longer fully specified. This creates uncertainty in ensuring that important contractual notices (like notice of breach) are properly served and received.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'and reimburse Miltenyi' introduces an inconsistency. The original text establishes a separate agreement for sublicense rights, including a commitment to hold Miltenyi harmless and reimburse their fees. By omitting the reimbursement clause, we create a contradiction because while the agreement is for Bellicum to 'hold harmless' which implies covering any fees to Miltenyi, now Bellicum is only responsible for holding harmless without a clear financial obligation to reimburse actual payments. This makes the enforcement uncertain because the financial implications are ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"Provided Bellicum is not then in default with its material obligations hereunder,\" we create a contradiction. Previously, the ability to renew the contract was conditional upon Bellicum's adherence to its obligations. Now, this condition is removed, yet the contract still contains clauses specifying Bellicum's obligations (e.g., payment terms, forecasts). If Bellicum fails to meet those obligations, yet can still renew the contract, this creates uncertainty regarding the enforceability of these obligations during the renewal term, as well as potential disputes over whether a renewed term can be voided due to pre-existing breaches.",

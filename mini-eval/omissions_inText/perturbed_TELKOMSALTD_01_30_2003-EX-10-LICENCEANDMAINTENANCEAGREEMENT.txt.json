                "explanation": "By omitting the reference to Annexure 1 where DESIGNATED SITES are initially defined, and removing the requirement for written agreement for additional sites, the definition becomes vague. Later clauses that rely on a specific, agreed-upon DESIGNATED SITE (e.g., for installation, maintenance) become difficult to enforce, creating uncertainty. The original text provides a clear method for designating sites, while the changed text removes this crucial element, which will be used in the other perturbations.",

TELKOM further agrees to USE the SOFTWARE only in accordance with the   DOCUMENTATION or as may otherwise be agreed in writing by SAP AFRICA,   which may not be unreasonably withheld. TELKOM may connect multiple   application servers to each DESIGNATED UNIT and connect a network of   computer terminals and workstations to the application servers. TELKOM may   install the software on another DESIGNATED UNIT for disaster recovery and   business continuity purposes. It is recorded for the avoidance of doubt that   TELKOM shall not be entitled to install the SOFTWARE on another   DESIGNATED UNIT or other hardware situated at another site within the   TERRITORY for the purposes of establishing and operating a Marketplace as   defined in clause 3. 9.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to be 'as agreed to by the parties in annexure 1 hereto' when installing in Designated Site, the modified text contradicts the initial designation method outlined in the original clause 2.3.4 (already perturbed). By removing the NOT, it allows installation anywhere. This creates an internal contradiction as the contract refers to the Designated Site but Telkom could potentially install the software anywhere, undermining the control and monitoring capabilities initially granted to SAP AFRICA.",

Maintenance Service by SAP AFRICA shall, unless   expressly agreed otherwise in writing, be provided only to the DESIGNATED   SITE as specified in annexure 1. Maintenance Service includes the delivery of   RELEASES and VERSIONS, support via telephone, the correction of defects,   SAP AFRICA'S remote support on-line SOFTWARE services, and those other   services as set out in annexure 2. It is conditional upon TELKOM receiving   Maintenance Service that TELKOM must make all required remote support and   connections to the DESIGNATED UNIT, at its expense, as reasonably requested   by SAP AFRICA. It is recorded that, unless the parties should agree otherwise,   such remote access shall be by a dial - up facility only.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'as specified in annexure 1', but maintaning 'Designated Site', this introduces a contradiction. Given the altered clause 2.3.4, which allows for Designated Site in the TERRITORY and clause 3.3, Telkom is allowed to install the software anywhere and SAP is obligated to provide maintenance at all sites, creating financial strain. The original annexure 1 no longer strictly governs the location, yet the obligation of maintenance at the DESIGNATED SITE remains, creating uncertainty about the scope and cost of maintenance.",

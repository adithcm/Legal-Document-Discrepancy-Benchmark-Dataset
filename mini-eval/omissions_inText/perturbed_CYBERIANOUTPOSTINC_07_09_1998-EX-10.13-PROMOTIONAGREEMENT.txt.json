For such purposes, a                  \"Retail Impression\" means the display of one page of a CNET                  Site that contains at least one Retail Promotion. If CNET fails                  to provide the Retail Impressions required by the preceding                  sentence during the Term, then CNET will continue to display                  Retail Impressions in accordance with this Agreement following                  the Term (notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the                  Term) until the required number of Retail Impressions has been                  delivered.",

                "explanation": "By removing section 2.3.2, the specific number of Retail Impressions to be provided by CNET is omitted. However, subsequent clauses still refer to 'Retail Impressions' and the possibility of not meeting the initial targets. This creates an internal contradiction because the contract mentions the need to deliver a certain amount of Retail Impressions, but the specifics about how many is missing, making enforcement uncertain.",

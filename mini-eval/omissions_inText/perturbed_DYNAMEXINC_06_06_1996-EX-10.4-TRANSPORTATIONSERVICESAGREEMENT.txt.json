                "explanation": "The definition of \"Agreement\" and \"Force Majeure\" was removed, but subsequent clauses (e.g. 24.2) still refer to the attached Schedules and Force Majeure. This creates an internal contradiction as these terms are used but never defined, creating uncertainty as to which schedules are under consideration or what constitutes Force Majeure.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specified 90% on-time performance, a clear objective measure is lost. Although 'reasonable on time performance level' and 'Service Failure' are still mentioned, the absence of a quantifiable metric creates ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce these stipulations with precision, leading to potential disputes and uncertainties.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Schedules D and E (and not providing an alternative), the contract now lacks specific rate information. However, subsequent sections, such as Section 5.0 (Payment Procedures) still reference invoices for services rendered and payment terms, which is impossible without defined rates. This creates a clear internal contradiction, as the contract implies financial obligations without outlining the rates that dictate those obligations.",

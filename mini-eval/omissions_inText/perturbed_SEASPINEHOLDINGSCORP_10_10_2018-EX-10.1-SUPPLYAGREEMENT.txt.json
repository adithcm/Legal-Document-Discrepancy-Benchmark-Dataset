                "original_text": "1.17. \"Net Sales\" means the gross amount of all revenues invoiced and received by Integra and its Affiliates from Integra Customers from the Sale of Treated Integra Products and Partially Treated Integra Products, less the following deductions (to the extent otherwise then or previously included in the gross amounts invoiced and in respect of which no previous deduction was taken): (i) amounts taken or accrued for sales, distributor or other commissions allowed, discounts allowed dealers, trade and/or quantity and cash discounts; (ii) refunds, rebates, chargebacks, replacements or credits and allowances actually allowed or granted to purchasers on account of contractual obligations, rejections, returns, or billing errors and for uncollectible amounts (except to the extent later collected) on Sales; (iii) sales, use and/or other excise taxes, import and/or export duties paid, tariffs, and any other governmental tax or charge (except income taxes) imposed on or at the time of production, importation, use, or sale of the Treated Integra Product or Partially Treated Integra Product, including any value added taxes, and taxes on medical devices; (iv) shipping insurance costs and prepaid transportation and/or freight charges. Net Sales shall exclude any amounts Integra or its Affiliates receive for Treated Integra Product or Partially Treated Integra Product that are used for clinical trials required or reasonably deemed to be desirable for Regulatory Approval or additional product indications in any country.",

Net Sales shall exclude any amounts Integra or its Affiliates receive for Treated Integra Product or Partially Treated Integra Product that are used for clinical trials.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'less the following deductions' to 'less deductions as determined by Integra's standard accounting practices,' and removing the specific deduction criteria, the contract now creates an internal contradiction. The original text defined specific deductions, offering PcoMed clarity on how Net Sales are calculated. The edited text provides no such clarity and gives Integra leeway to alter deduction methods.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PcoMed hereby grants to Integra and its Affiliates a sole and exclusive worldwide right to sell and commercialize Integra Products treated by PcoMed, with the PcoMed Surface Modification Technology (the \"Right\") for use in the Field in the Territory, including the right to conduct research and development in support of any of the foregoing. Nothing herein grants any rights to Integra (i) to manufacture any products using the PcoMed Surface Modification Technology or (ii) to sell or commercialize any products utilizing the PcoMed Surface Modification Technology other than the Integra Products for use in the Field in the Territory. Neither PcoMed nor its Affiliates shall sell or offer for sale, or grant rights under the PcoMed Surface Modification Technology to any Third Party in the Field in the Territory for products that utilize or embody the PcoMed Surface Modification Technology. Except as expressly stated in the preceding sentence, PcoMed shall not be subject to any restriction under this Agreement with regard to the PcoMed Surface Modification Technology. Without limiting the foregoing or Section 8.3 below, the exclusive nature of the Rights shall not in any way limit PcoMed from making, having made, using, selling or offering for sale products and/or services that do not utilize or embody the PcoMed Surface Modification Technology.",

                "explanation": "By removing the terms 'sole' and 'exclusive' when granting commercialization rights, and deleting the sentence that explicitly restricts PcoMed from selling to Third Parties, the section contradicts the initial statement of the grant being exclusive. This is because the rest of the agreement still presumes exclusive arrangement is in place, especially regarding financial obligations (section 2).",

Expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the Parties of any obligation accruing prior to such expiration or termination. (b) Termination of Rights. Subject to Section 4.-4(c), upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Rights and all rights of either party hereunder shall immediately cease and terminate. (c) Transition. After early termination of this Agreement (other than a termination based on a breach of Sections 5 or 8 by Integra) and continuing for a period of eighteen (18) months thereafter, Integra and its Affiliates may Sell any Treated Integra Product and Partially Treated Integra Product in its inventory in the Field, and may, with respect to all components which, prior to the effective date of termination, were ordered or manufactured with the anticipation of being included as Treated Integra Product or Partially Treated Integra Product, complete their manufacture and sell them as though they had been inventory on the effective date of termination, subject to payment of all amounts payable to PcoMed for such Sales under this Agreement. (d) Survival. The following provisions of this Agreement and all defined terms shall survive termination of this Agreement for any reason: Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.4(c), 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12.",

                "explanation": "By removing section 4.4(c) from the survival clause, there is a contradiction. Section 4.4(c) defines a transition period post-termination in which Integra can still sell products, but that transition is no longer defined as surviving. Because Section 2.2 and 2.3 still survive (payment terms) and Section 4.4(c) outlines sales post termination but does not survive the termination of the contract, a situation arises whereby there may be a payment obligation stemming from a clause that is no longer applicable post termination.",

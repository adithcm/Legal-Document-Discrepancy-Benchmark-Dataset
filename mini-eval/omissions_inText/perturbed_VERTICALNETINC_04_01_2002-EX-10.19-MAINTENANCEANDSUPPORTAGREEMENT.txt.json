This creates an internal contradiction because Section 2.3 states that 'Converge shall classify all Problems reported to VNE according to the Problem Severity Levels listed in Exhibit A attached hereto.'",

VNE shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Converge with an initial response to and status reports for all Problems reported by Converge, and to resolve all Problems identified, in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B attached hereto; provided, however, that VNE shall have no further obligation to respond to or attempt to diagnose or resolve a Problem once it is determined not to be attributable to Errors. VNE will review all Problem Requests submitted by Converge at the Problem Severity Level indicated by Converge unless another Problem Severity Level is clearly warranted. In the event of a reasonable uncertainty, the parties will assume a higher Severity Level for a Problem until they have sufficient information to make a determination that a lower Severity Level is warranted. If, at Converge's request, VNE responds to a Problem at a Severity Level that is higher than what proves to be the actual Severity Level of the Problem, or if VNE's review of a Problem reported by Converge establishes that the Problem was not due to an Error, Converge shall pay or reimburse VNE for all incremental fees and expenses reasonably incurred by VNE in performing such activities.",

This creates an internal contradiction because Section 4.3 states: 'For each quarter during the Term of this Agreement that Converge pays the applicable Monthly Installments, Converge shall be entitled to receive Services in an amount equal to the Quarterly Allocation'. Without Exhibit C, 'Quarterly Allocation' is undefined.",

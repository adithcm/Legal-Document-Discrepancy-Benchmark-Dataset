                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"competitive retailer\" will be determined at Excite's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear definition of 'competitive retailer' by listing examples. The modified text removes these examples and introduces ambiguity by granting Excite sole discretion in determining what constitutes a 'competitive retailer.' This creates uncertainty in enforcement as Client's interpretation of being fairly presented vs. a competitor is subject to Excite's biased interpretation.",

These fees will be paid in equal monthly installments 7 CONFIDENTIAL of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The first monthly payment will be due upon the display of the first of the promotional placements and advertising described in the Agreement. Subsequent installments will be due on a monthly basis thereafter. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.",

The first monthly payment will be due upon the display of the first of the promotional placements and advertising described in the Agreement. Subsequent installments will be due on a monthly basis thereafter.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that 'the Client will pay Excite sponsorship and advertising fees of XXXXXXXXXXX for the first year of the term of the Agreement' while the modified text indicates that the payment amount will be in 'a separate addendum.' However, the contract proceeds to state 'The first monthly payment will be due upon the display of the first of the promotional placements and advertising described in the Agreement,' This creates contradiction and uncertainty in enforcement because there's a reference to the Client making these payments, but the specific fees/amounts are missing and allegedly in a separate document which is not attached.",

These percentages will be outlined in Schedule A.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified percentages for variable revenue share based on different revenue tiers. The modified text removes these specific percentages, stating that they will be 'negotiate in good faith' and added to Schedule A. The contract later indicates the existence of these revenue shares ('g) Client will maintain accurate records with respect to the calculation of all variable revenue share payments due under this Agreement.') yet Schedule A is nowhere to be found. This omission introduces a contradiction as the contract references an important document without specifying the specific percentages and Schedule A doesn't exist.",

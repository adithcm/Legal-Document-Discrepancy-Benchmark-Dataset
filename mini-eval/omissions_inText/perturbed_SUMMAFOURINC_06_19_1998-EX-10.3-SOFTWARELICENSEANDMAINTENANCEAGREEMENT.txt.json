                "original_text": "1.7      \"Defect\" shall mean any failure of Licensed Technology to meet the Specification as a result of a material failure (including an error or \"bug\" that is material) of the Licensed Technology. \"Material\" is defined as priority A, B, and C in Article 6.3.",
                "changed_text": "1.7      \"Defect\" shall mean any failure of Licensed Technology to meet the Specification. The classification of defects is outlined elsewhere in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to Article 6.3 for the definition of 'Material' defects (priorities A, B, and C), the contract creates uncertainty. Other sections, specifically Article 6, still rely on the understanding that defects are categorized in this manner. This omission contradicts the continued use of those categories and makes enforcement unclear.",

Licensee Products which do not run the Licensed Technology are not subject to runtime license fees.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'which contains the Licensed Technology for Basic Services and simple conferencing which does not require network echo cancellation technology' creates a contradiction. Previously, Licensee Products *without* the defined Licensed Technology were exempt, the modified text creates a blanket fee, regardless of whether the licensed technology is utilized.",

Without these details on what is considered a 'fair' or 'authorized' use, the contract remains unclear. Especially if the 'licensed technology' fails. How will the client recover a previous authorized version if the 'copies' clause has been removed?",

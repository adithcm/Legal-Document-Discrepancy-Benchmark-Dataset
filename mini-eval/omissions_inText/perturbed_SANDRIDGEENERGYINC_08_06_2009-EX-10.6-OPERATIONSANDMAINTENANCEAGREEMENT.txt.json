                "original_text": "Unless otherwise instructed by Owner, Operator shall, on behalf of Owner, (i) prepare and file all Tax Returns and all other regulatory or state filings required to be filed by Owner in connection with its ownership and operation of the Gathering System other than those Tax Returns described in Section 6.3.2.1 no later than the filing date for the relevant Tax Return or other filing (taking into account all valid extensions approved by Owner prior to filing).",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise instructed by Owner, Operator may prepare and file some Tax Returns and some other regulatory or state filings required to be filed by Owner.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the Operator's responsibility for filing tax returns. The original text clearly mandates the Operator to prepare and file all tax returns unless explicitly instructed otherwise. The modified text uses 'may' instead of 'shall', making the filing of tax returns discretionary and creating uncertainty. It also adds the word 'some', so it is not explicit which filings the Operator is in charge of.",

                "original_text": "Owner shall pay all such amounts prior to the later of (a) 50 days after the end of the month in which the expenses were incurred or (b) 10 days after the date of receipt of each invoice. Invoices received after 1:00 pm local time will be deemed received on the next Business Day. If the day on which any payment is due is not a Business Day, then the relevant payment shall be due upon the immediately succeeding Business Day. Any amounts which remain due and owing after the due date shall bear interest at the lower of the prime rate as published in the \"Money Rates\" section of The Wall Street Journal plus two percent (2%) per annum and the maximum lawful rate of interest, compounded daily from the date such payment is due until such payment is made.",
                "changed_text": "Owner shall pay expenses in a timely manner. Any amounts which remain due and owing after an unspecified due date may bear interest at a rate determined by Owner.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear payment schedule and interest rate for late payments. The modified text removes these specifics, stating only that payments should be 'timely' which is vague. It then states that late amounts 'may' bear interest at a rate the Owner determines, making interest application discretionary. This contradicts the intent of ensuring timely payment with a defined penalty for delays, creating uncertainty and a potential conflict of interest for Owner.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'some', it is not explicit what duties the Operator is in charge of. By making 'good and workmanlike' to 'a manner', it is uncertain the quality of duty. By removing specific conformity to practices it contradicts the original intent. By making it 'generally' in accordance with applicable laws and expense budgets, it contradicts the original contract and make those things uncertain. Now, by adding expectation instead of budget, there is no guidance for budget.",

The total sum of Service Fee shall be equal to the amount of profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause detailing how the Service Fee is calculated (equal to the amount of profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries) and the clause indicating Party B's right to adjust it at its discretion, the contract now lacks clarity on the crucial aspect of financial compensation. Later sections that refer to the Service Fee (4.2, 4.3) are therefore ambiguous and potentially unenforceable, as the method of calculating it is undefined, creating an internal contradiction. The term Service Fee is still present but the method of calculation is omitted.",

                "explanation": "By removing clause 6.2.3 which specifies consequences if agreement is terminated due to force majeure event then cross-reference in section 6.1.3 is unresolvable because in section 10 the 'force majeure' is defined. This introduces uncertainty and potential disputes regarding liabilities if termination results from force majeure, as the rights and obligations are no longer clearly defined.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'Intellectual Property', the contract creates ambiguity regarding what specific assets are owned by Party B. Later references to 'Intellectual Property' lack a clear scope. The agreement states intellectual property rights are owned by Party B but doesn't define them which makes the enforcement uncertain.",

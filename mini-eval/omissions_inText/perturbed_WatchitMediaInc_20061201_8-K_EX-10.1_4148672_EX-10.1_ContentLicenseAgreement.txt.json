            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) per month multiplied by the number of months remain on the agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Oceanic Time Warner Cable removes the above content and or terminates this agreement prior to December 31, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable agrees to pay a cancellation fee as specified elsewhere in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific cancellation fee calculation, but still mentioning the fee, an internal contradiction is created. If the fee is not specified elsewhere, the enforceability of the cancellation clause becomes uncertain. This modification removes the definite amount of the cancelation fee and replaces it with 'specified elsewhere in this agreement', which is never defined. This omission creates ambiguity and thus uncertainty of enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Ocean Time Warner Cable may provide Watchit with data on viewership to Channel 777.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'specifically to the content provided by Watchit' and changing 'will' to 'may', the obligation to provide specific viewership data is removed, however, the contract still states that some viewership data will be provided which means that any further details regarding which type of data they will receive and the frequency are not clear, causing issues in enforcement.",
                "location": "Paragraph 8"

                "original_text": "Watchit shall have the exclusive right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content and will have the right to brand the content under the Watchit brand and place a \"bug\" on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark.",
                "changed_text": "Watchit shall have the right to brand the content. Details for branding and trademark usage will be determined at a later time.",
                "explanation": "By removing the exclusive right to sell third party advertising and the right to place a 'bug' on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark, and replacing it with a vague statement about future determination, the original intent of Watchit's branding rights is undermined, and uncertainty is introduced around what branding can and cannot be done. This creates an internal contradiction because the original clause clearly outlined specific rights, while the modified text suggests those rights are now subject to future negotiation, causing uncertainty of enforcement.",

Product may also include liquefied petroleum gas commodities such as butane. Product, as designed in this Agreement, does not refer to finished gasoline and diesel products.",

                "explanation": "This change broadens the definition of 'Product' to include any liquid commodity, directly contradicting the original definition's exclusion of finished gasoline and diesel products. This introduces uncertainty, as other sections reference the original definition with specific limitations; now the term lacks clear boundaries which could create disputes on what volumes the commitment applies to.",

The rates vary depending upon project options, but in all instances will be $0.01 per barrel above the rates for uncommitted service for the same origin and destination points. A Committed Priority Shipper will have the same rates as the Committed Non-Priority Shipper (as defined below), unless the system in under prorationing. When under prorationing, the Committed Priority Shipper's rate will be charged the premium rate of $0.01 above the posted uncommitted rate. Shipper shall not be a Committed Priority Shipper solely through this Agreement. Shipper must submit a Capacity Request Form during MPL's binding open season (Exhibit C) which confirms the Shipper has elected Committed Priority Shipper Status.",

Shipper must submit a Capacity Request Form during MPL's binding open season (Exhibit C) which confirms the Shipper has elected Committed Priority Shipper Status.",
                "explanation": "By removing the line specifying the price difference during prorationing and normal operations, this section now contradicts Exhibit B and C that details rates for Committed Priority Shippers under different operational conditions. The removal of specific rate advantages creates ambiguity and allows for rates to change depending on MPL's prioritization, without outlining any clear pricing structure during these different conditions. The 'rates vary depending upon project options, but in all instances will be $0.01 per barrel above the rates for uncommitted service for the same origin and destination points.' line has also been removed.",

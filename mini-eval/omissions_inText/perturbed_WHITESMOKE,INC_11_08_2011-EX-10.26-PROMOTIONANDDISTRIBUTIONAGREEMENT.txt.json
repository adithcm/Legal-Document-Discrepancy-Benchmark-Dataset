                "explanation": "The original definitions of \"Chrome Use Event\" and \"Chrome Server Communication\" contained bracketed asterisks, indicating confidential information was omitted. By replacing these with vague and undefined terms, the agreement loses clarity and creates uncertainty around what exactly constitutes a 'Chrome Use Event' or qualifies for 'Chrome Server Communication'. The original terms reference specific criteria now missing, making enforcement and measurement difficult.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the [ * ] of [ * ] by Google to Distributor for all  [ * ] and all [ * ] in respect of [ * ] (as set out in Exhibit A) exceed [ * ] ([ * ]) of the [ * ] to Distributor for such [ * ].",

                "explanation": "The original section on 'Payments' refers to confidential information regarding payment frequency, calculation specifics (each [ * ] and each [ * ]) and measurement of activity. By removing these specifics and replacing them with generalized statements like 'an amount as described in Exhibit A' and 'payments based on user engagement', the contract becomes ambiguous. Exhibit A is still referenced, but without context the reference is unclear, contradicting the intention of clear payment terms.",

                "explanation": "Clause 8.2 originally included a warranty period of '[ * ]' which is now removed. By omitting the specific warranty period, the amended clause creates ambiguity regarding how long Google is liable for defects. Clause 8.3 is modified to remove Google's responsibility to 'supply Distributor with a corrected or replacement version of the Distribution Product' and remove requirement to 'not materially detrimental to Distributor'. The changed clause 8.3 is creating contradiction between responsibility of Google to fix the problem with no replacement. The clause weakens distributors position to be able to sell fully functioning product to the market.",

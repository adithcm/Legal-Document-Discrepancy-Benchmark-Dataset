When used as a verb, \"Detail\" means to deliver the presentation described in this definition. \"Detailing\" shall have a corresponding meaning.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirements for the detail to be ‘in-person’ and ‘fair and balanced’ and ‘consistent with the Product Label…Promotion Rules and applicable laws’ , the definition becomes vague. This creates a contradiction with the other clauses like section 3.1.3. Compliance with Laws where the previous definition clearly stated what a detail should be. Now, the contract is internally inconsistent as one section allows for non-compliant Details while the other mandates strict compliance.",

The Brand Plan includes a plan that sets forth all of the training that Janssen deems necessary or advisable for the Sales Representatives and any other employees of Company conducting activities under this Agreement (such other employees, the \"Other Company Employees\") to complete prior to conducting activities under this Agreement (the \"Training Activities Plan\"). The Training Activities Plan shall indicate which Party is responsible for providing such training, when such training will be provided and how such training will be provided (e.g., in person or remotely, which may include live audio/video conference calls, or electronically such as via learning management systems). The initial Training Activities Plan includes a plan for conducting and completing the Product-Specific Training and (as applicable) state Law compliance training of the Sales Representatives before the Launch Date. The initial Training Activities Plan also includes a plan for conducting and completing before the Launch Date compliance training of the Sales Representatives and the Other Company Employees in a manner consistent with all applicable pharmaceutical industry standards. Janssen may update the Training Activities Plan from time to time to include any additional training that Janssen deems necessary or advisable to refresh or update the knowledge of the Sales Representatives and the Other Company Employees.\n\n(b) Training Responsibilities. Janssen shall conduct all Product-Specific Training to the Sales Representatives and Other Company Employees. Company shall at all times ensure that each Sales Representative and Other Company Employee (including Sales Representatives and Other Company Employee that are engaged after Launch Date) has received the Product- Specific Training and any other training set forth in the Training Activities Plan.\n\n(c) Examination. Janssen shall administer to each Sales Representative an examination of the Product- Specific Training topics and any other training topics that Janssen deems necessary or advisable. The first such examination of the Sales Representatives shall occur no later than the Launch Date. Janssen shall determine the minimum score that is considered a minimum passing score for each examination (the \"Passing Score\"). Company shall ensure that, before conducting any Detailing of the Product pursuant to this Agreement, each Sales Representative has completed the Product-Specific Training and other training described in the Training Activities Plan and has achieved a Passing Score on such examination. Upon Company's request, Janssen shall provide, as soon as reasonably practicable, additional remedial training and re-testing of Sales Representatives who fail to achieve a Passing Score. Any Sales Representative\n\nwho does not obtain a Passing Score on such an examination shall not be permitted by Company to perform in-person presentations of the Product unless and until such Sales Representative is re-tested and achieves a Passing Score.",

                "explanation": "By omitting sections (b) and (c), including 'Training Responsibilities' and 'Examination', there is a contradiction. It is not clear the responsibility of each party and how they should act in this situations. This creates uncertainty regarding the expected training standards and whether Sales Representatives need to achieve a certain level of proficiency before performing details.",

                "original_text": "Section 1.1 Definitions. The following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below throughout this Agreement:\n\n\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person, any other person who directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such person. The term \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the terms \"controlled\" and \"controlling\" have meanings correlative thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this Agreement and all exhibits thereto, the term Affiliate shall not apply to the relationship between RGHI or RGHL or either of their respective Affiliates on the one hand and RCP and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on the other hand.",

The following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below throughout this Agreement:\n\n\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person, any other person who directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such person.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' specifically excludes the relationship between RGHI/RGHL and RCP/its subsidiaries for the *purposes of this agreement*. Removing this clarification introduces ambiguity and potential contradictions. Later sections might inadvertently treat these entities as Affiliates, leading to disputes over service obligations, liability, or intellectual property rights. For example, if Section 2.2 allows 'Affiliates' to perform services without recipient consent, RCP might argue RGHI subsidiaries need their consent, contrary to the original intention.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Termination can only be as per an agreed Migration Plan' under G1.1 IT Service Category in Exhibit A, it implies that the termination of these IT services can occur independently of the agreed Migration Plan, contradicting Section 2.1(c), which mandates a Migration Plan. This will result in uncertainty about service termination rights and obligations, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'a rescission of this Agreement' from Section 9.2, it contradicts Section 10.3 Specific Performance, which gives parties the right to seek 'an injunction to prevent actual or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement'. The exclusion of the right to seek rescission in Section 9.2 could be interpreted as restricting the availability of specific performance, which is essentially a judicial order to uphold the contract, potentially leading to disputes over the remedies available for breaches.",

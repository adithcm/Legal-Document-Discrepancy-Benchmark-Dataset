                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" shall mean, when used with respect to any Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Person. For this purpose, \"control\" of any Person shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, by ownership of voting interest, by contract or otherwise. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) with respect to PennTex Midstream Partners, LLC and its subsidiaries, the term \"Affiliate\" shall exclude Memorial Resource Development Corp. and each of its subsidiaries and (ii) with respect to Memorial Resource Development Corp. and its subsidiaries, the term \"Affiliate\" shall exclude PennTex Midstream Partners, LLC and each of its subsidiaries.",

For this purpose, \"control\" of any Person shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, by ownership of voting interest, by contract or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The exclusion of Memorial Resource Development Corp. and its subsidiaries from the definition of 'Affiliate' for PennTex Midstream Partners, LLC, and vice versa, is removed. This creates a contradiction if other clauses rely on this specific exclusion for determining liabilities or permitted assignments later in the contract.",

This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue in full force and effect until the end of the fifteenth (15th) Contract Year, and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter until terminated by either Party by providing thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice of termination to the other Party (such fifteen (15) Contract Year period, as may be further extended as provided herein is referred to as the \"Term\").",

                "explanation": "By removing 'until the end of the fifteenth (15th) Contract Year, and shall continue', the initial fixed term of 15 years is omitted. The Term's definition becomes self-referential and unclear when it begins and its enforceability concerning the initial agreement is undermined.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either Party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party without the consent of the other Party, (ii) either Party may pledge this Agreement to secure any credit facility or indebtedness of such Party or its Affiliates without the consent of the other Party, (iii) Transporter may assign this Agreement without Customer's consent in connection with the sale or transfer of the Transportation System, and (iv) Customer may assign or partially assign this Agreement without Transporter's consent in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of Customer's ownership interests in the wells (or in the lands upon which such wells are located) producing Customer Gas delivered hereunder, provided that such assignee has a credit rating reasonably acceptable to Transporter at the time of such sale or transfer. In the case of transfers under clause (iv) above, the transferor shall be released from its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement to the extent of the obligations assumed by the transferee, provided that Customer's and such transferee's combined obligations to Transporter shall be no greater than Customer's obligations to Transporter prior to such transfer.",

                "explanation": "Removing clauses (iii) and (iv) regarding assignments related to the Transportation System's sale/transfer and Customer's ownership interests creates an internal inconsistency. If the Transportation System is sold or Customer's ownership changes, the contract lacks clear guidelines on assignment, contradicting the initial 'Restrictions on Assignment' clause and potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing '(iii) the Recipe', we create a contradiction because Section 6(a)(ii) refers to 'Reed's Intellectual Property' and 'Deliverables' separately. The Deliverables are defined as being owned by Reed's, and if Recipes are no longer part of Reed's Intellectual Property, the ownership and rights to Recipes become ambiguous, leading to uncertainty in enforcement regarding who owns the recipes and how they can be used.",

Reed's will exclusively own all Deliverables. Company will and hereby does, without further consideration, irrevocably assign to Reed's any and all worldwide right, title or interest that Company may now or hereafter possess in or to the Deliverables in perpetuity (or the maximum period permitted by Applicable Laws and Regulations) and Reed's accepts such assignment. Company will execute and deliver documents reasonably requested by Reed's to register its Intellectual Property in the Deliverables.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'Company will execute and deliver documents reasonably requested by Reed's to register its Intellectual Property in the Deliverables', Reed's ability to definitively and legally establish its ownership of the Deliverables is weakened. This contrasts with the earlier statement that Reed's 'will exclusively own all Deliverables,' because there is no longer a clear mechanism for Reed's to enforce that ownership through registration, thus introducing a contradiction regarding the extent of Reed's exclusive ownership.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Recipes' from the requirement that the Development Committee agree to the Recipes in writing, it is now ambiguous how the Recipes are approved. The section on 'Rights and Obligations' still refers to developing products according to 'Specifications', but if the Recipes are not formally approved, this creates a contradiction on how the Products are determined to be commercially ready and who has final say on the ingredients.",

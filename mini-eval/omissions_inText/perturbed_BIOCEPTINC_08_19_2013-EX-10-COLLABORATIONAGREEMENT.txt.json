                "original_text": "1.8 \"CPT Code\" shall mean the American Medical Association's (\"AMA\") \"Current Procedural Terminology\" as published in the AMA's CPT Process Manual, Fourth Edition and any such future editions, for procedures used in performance of the Assay, and amounts reimbursed by Medicare for such procedures for location 99, as modified annually.",
                "changed_text": "1.8 \"CPT Code\" shall mean a coding system used to report medical procedures.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to the American Medical Association's CPT and Medicare reimbursement rates, the definition becomes vague. Other sections that rely on the specific definition of 'CPT Code' for billing and revenue sharing will now be ambiguous, creating uncertainty in enforcement and potentially leading to disputes about the basis for calculating payments. Specifically section 3.3(g)(i) which details billing and auditing responsibilities.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties shall collaborate to provide the following:\n\n(a) Test Development. The parties shall mutually agree on the content and composition of Phase II of the Assay, and any Collaboration Assays as defined in Section 3.5(f), including specific analytes to be included in the Assay. Consideration for selection of analytes shall include medical need, clinical utility, technical feasibility, costs, reimbursement, and intellectual property status, e.g., the need for Third Party licenses to specific analytes. The parties shall agree on the Phase II Assay content at least six (6) months before anticipated Launch.",
                "changed_text": "3.5 Joint Responsibilities. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and collaborate to develop the market for the Tests in the Territory. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties shall collaborate to provide the following:\n\n(a) Test Development. The parties shall discuss possible new analytes for tests. Consideration for selection of analytes shall include intellectual property status, e.g., the need for Third Party licenses to specific analytes. The parties will try to agree on test content before Launch.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference of the importance of medical need, clinical utility, costs, and reimbursement when creating a new test, as well as removing the time frame of six months before anticipated launch, the modified text creates internal contradiction. Section 9.2 (a) specifically states that 'As of the Effective Date, the Assay employs Biocept's most current CTC-based technology, and will be validated for performing CTC enumeration and the detection of the indicated analytes in the Assay on a timeline as agreed by the parties within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date'. This original text shows that Biocept uses current technology, however, by omitting certain parts of section 3.5 (a), the text contradicts the claim because tests may not be as medically beneficial or the most medically feasible.",

Each party, at its own expense, shall maintain product liability and other appropriate insurance (or self- insure) in an amount consistent with industry standards during the Term and shall name the other party as an additional insured with respect to such insurance. Each party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other party upon request.",
                "changed_text": "12.4 Insurance. Each party should maintain insurance during the Term.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the specifics of maintaining product liability insurance in an amount consistent with industry standards and the requirement to name the other party as an additional insured, the modified text creates ambiguity. This omission contradicts the indemnification clauses (12.1 and 12.2) which allocate risk and liability between the parties. Without the specified insurance coverage, the indemnification provisions become less effective, creating uncertainty about how potential liabilities will be covered and enforced, and contradicting the intent of having those clauses in the first place.",

You will contribute to the Buffalo Wild Wings Advertising and Development Fund (\"Fund\") (which may be one of several regional Funds, if we elect to establish separate Funds to serve various regions in which multiple franchisees are located) an amount equal to three percent (3%) of your Gross Sales, as defined in Paragraph X. Your required payments to the Fund will be made on or before the fifteenth day of the month for the preceding month. These contributions may be withdrawn from your bank account as provided in Paragraph X. We will use such funds to conduct local, regional or national advertising. Such payments shall be made in addition to and exclusive of any sums that you may be required to spend on system or grand opening advertising and promotion. The Fund shall be maintained and administered by us or our designee, as follows:\n1. We will oversee all advertising programs and have sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials and media used in such programs including the placement and allocation. We will use the Fund to conduct national advertising, and/or, if regional Funds are developed, to conduct regional or local advertising on your behalf, at our sole discretion. We may also use such funds to conduct advertising in your local advertising market. However, we cannot and do not ensure that any particular franchisee will benefit directly or pro rata from the placement of advertising.",

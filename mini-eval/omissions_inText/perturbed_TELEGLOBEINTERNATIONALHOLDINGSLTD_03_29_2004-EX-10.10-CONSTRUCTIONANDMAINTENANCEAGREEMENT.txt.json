Each Maintenance Authority shall have prompt access necessary for the performance of its 10.7 [Missing] interruption. if the MA responsible, as specified in this Paragraph 10, fails to restore those facilities to efficient working order and operation within a reasonable time after having been called upon to do so by any other Party to whom capacity is assigned by this Agreement, the Management Committee may, to the extent that it is practical to do so, place, or cause to be placed, such facilities in efficient working order and operation and charge the Parties their proportionate shares of the costs reasonably incurred in doing so.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase '[Missing] interruption' from section 10.7, but retaining the subsequent sentence which clearly refers to the missing element of the interruption to services, creates a contradiction. The missing element makes the obligations of the MA ambiguous, as it is unclear what should not be interrupted. This creates uncertainty in the enforcement of duties.",

                "explanation": "The omission of clause 12.1 creates a contradiction. Since it's no longer required to be a Carrier to use capacity, many other clauses referring to a carrier are not enforceable. For example, clauses 12.6 and 12.7.

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly defines the Standstill Period with a clear start and end date, the modified version introduces ambiguity by stating that the period will be determined at the Company's discretion, creating an internal contradiction and rendering Section 3 unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "The Company agrees that, during the Standstill Period (as defined below), if any of the New Directors is unable to serve as a director for any reason, resigns as a director, or is removed as a director prior to the end of the term of office, and at such time the Investor Group beneficially owns in the aggregate at least three percent (3.0%) of the Company's then outstanding Common Stock (subject to adjustment for share issuances, stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and similar actions by the Company that increase the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then the Company and the Investor Group shall work together in good faith to identify and select a replacement director candidate to be appointed to the Board which shall only be appointed to the Board after having been mutually agreed upon by both the Company and the Investor Group.",

                "explanation": "By removing the condition that the Investor Group must own at least 3.0% of the Common Stock and giving the Company sole discretion in selecting a replacement director, this contradicts the initial intent of the agreement, which was to give the Investor Group a say in the Board composition. This change creates an internal contradiction in the balance of power between the Company and the Investor Group.",

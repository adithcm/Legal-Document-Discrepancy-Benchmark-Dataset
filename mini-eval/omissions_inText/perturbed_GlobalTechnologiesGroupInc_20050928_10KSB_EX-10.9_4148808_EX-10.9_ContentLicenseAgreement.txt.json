                "explanation": "By removing \"for purchase by consumers under the terms and conditions of the Agreement\", the definition of Launch becomes ambiguous. The agreement relies on the Launch date to determine the term, payment schedules, and other critical milestones. Omitting that the launch must have conditions tied to the agreement creates potential disputes about what constitutes a launch.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific amount of $250,000.00, the contract introduces ambiguity regarding the sponsor's financial obligation. While the 'Bank Wire Transformation Information' section still suggests a payment via wire transfer, there is no definite amount established, leading to potential disputes about the sponsor's contribution. The changed sentence 'for an amount to be determined by mutual agreement' sets a contradiction if the Wire Instructions implies a fixed amount.",

It becomes unclear exactly what intellectual property Kaya Fest retains rights to, making the restriction difficult to enforce and opening the door for interpretation.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Banners must be responsibility secured and not have any dangerous edges/sticks that may not cause harm if used inappropriately,' the contract eliminates the explicit safety standards required for banners. While the Sponsor is still responsible for creating, hanging, and removing banners, the absence of safety guidelines introduces ambiguity and potential liability issues if a banner-related accident occurs. This contradicts an implicit expectation of safety in the event venue.",

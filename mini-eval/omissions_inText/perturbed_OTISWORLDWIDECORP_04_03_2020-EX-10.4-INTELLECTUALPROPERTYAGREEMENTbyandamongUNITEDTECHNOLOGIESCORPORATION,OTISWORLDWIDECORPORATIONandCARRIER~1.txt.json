                "explanation": "Removing the definition of 'AAA Rules' while Section 8.2.2 still references it creates an internal contradiction. This omission makes the dispute resolution process ambiguous, as the governing rules for arbitration are no longer clearly defined.",

The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute promptly by negotiations among executives of the Parties who have authority to settle the Dispute. The disputing Party will give the other Party or Parties, as applicable, written notice of the Dispute.

If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice, any Party desiring a non-negotiated resolution shall refer the Dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to the then-current commercial arbitration rules and supplementary procedures of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA Rules\"). The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules in any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not requested and the value of the relief any Party seeks (whether by claim or counterclaim) does not exceed three million United States dollars (US $3,000,000). In all other matters, including any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is requested, the arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a panel of three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. Each Party will bear its own expenses (including attorneys' fees), and the Parties will share equally the compensation and expenses of the arbitrators and the arbitration.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement defines 'Impression' with specific technical parameters. By changing the definition to a 'general promotional view' and giving Excite the sole discretion to determine what constitutes an impression, it creates ambiguity and potential for abuse. Later sections still refer to calculating impressions with numbers, but the basis is now undefined, creating an internal contradiction. This change affects Section 1(e), 1(i), 5(i), and 5(j)",

Until Excite has the technical capability to count the activation of \"Try These First\" links to the NetGrocer Site, NetGrocer will report to Excite the number of \"Try These First\" referrals it records within twenty (20) days following the end of each calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"Click-through\" occurs when a user shows interest in the NetGrocer Site. Details on how this interest is measured will be determined at Excite's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement defines 'Click-through' with specific and measurable actions (activation of a link recorded by servers). The modified definition introduces significant ambiguity by using 'shows interest' without defining it, and granting Excite sole discretion on measurement. Sections of the contract such as 1(f), 1(g), and 5(d) reference a number of guaranteed click-throughs. The lack of clarity on the definition of 'click-through' creates an enforceable contradiction.",

NetGrocer will make these Click-through payments (if any) to Excite within thirty (30) days of Excite's monthly report and invoice reflecting Click-throughs during the first year of the term of the Agreement in excess of [*]",
                "changed_text": "NetGrocer will pay Excite a variable rate for successful promotions. The exact rate and success metrics will be determined and reported by Excite on a monthly basis.",
                "explanation": "The original section specifies a fixed cost per click-through. This is removed and replaced with a vague 'variable rate for successful promotions' and completely defers the determination of the rate and success metrics to Excite. This creates a contradiction because the agreement still implies a payment structure, but the fundamental basis for calculating that payment is undefined and unilaterally controlled by Excite. This is particularly problematic in relation to section 5(e), and 5(f) where specific click through rates are mentioned.",

Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",

                "explanation": "The original clause defines the 'Non-Compete Period' as two years post-closing and details restrictions on competition, including exceptions for passive investments and existing businesses. The modified clause removes the specific time frame and detailed restrictions, replacing them with a vague agreement to 'generally refrain from competing.' This creates an in-text contradiction because other sections might reference the 'Non-Compete Period' or the specific restrictions, but those restrictions no longer exist. Enforcement becomes uncertain because the scope of 'generally refrain' is undefined.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former",

To this end, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be construed to extend in time and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants contained in this Section 1 are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1 to govern competition by the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be governed by and construed according to the Law of all the jurisdictions in which competition in breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened that best gives them effect.",

By omitting this clause, there is an implication that the parties do not wish to extend the time, area, and degree of participation as is permitted by law and can create confusion within the contract if legal jurisdiction is required.",

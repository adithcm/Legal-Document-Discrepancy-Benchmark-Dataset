                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to California law, the edited text contradicts the initial agreement and introduces ambiguity. The edited version now refers to 'applicable law', but does not specify which jurisdiction's laws apply, leading to a potential conflict if a dispute arises and the parties are located in different states or countries.",

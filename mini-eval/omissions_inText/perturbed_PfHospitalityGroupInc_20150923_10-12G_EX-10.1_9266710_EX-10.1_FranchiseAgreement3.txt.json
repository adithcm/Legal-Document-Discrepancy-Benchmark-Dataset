Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member's relationship with Franchisee. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'knowledge, trade secrets or know-how' from the definition of Confidential Information, the clause becomes less specific. This creates uncertainty as to what constitutes confidential information, while later sections (like 2(a) regarding valuable specialized training) still rely on the original broader definition, causing contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the definition of \"Post-Term Period\" in section 2(d), section 2(c) becomes ambiguous. The contract mentions a Post-Term Period but fails to clearly define when this period begins and ends. This is a contradiction as the agreement relies on this period for enforcement but makes it impossible to enforce.",

This clause will now be more difficult to enforce, by removing the previous text.",

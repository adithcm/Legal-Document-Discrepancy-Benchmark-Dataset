                "original_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, all fees earned and expenses incurred by Agent up to and including the date of such termination shall be immediately due and payable to Agent on or before the effective date of such termination. In addition to the payments required in this section, if this Agreement is terminated by Client for any reason other than pursuant to Section 2 or Section 11(a) above or by Agent pursuant to Section 11(b) above, then Client shall pay a termination fee, due and payable to Agent on or before the effective date of such termination, calculated as follows: (i) if the termination occurs prior to the first anniversary of the commencement date of the current term (the \"Commencement Date\"), then the termination fee shall equal twelve (12) times the average monthly invoice charged to Client by Agent hereunder, (ii) if the termination occurs on or after the first anniversary of the Commencement Date but prior to the second anniversary of the Commencement Date, then the termination fee shall equal nine (9) times the average monthly invoice charged to Client by Agent hereunder, and (iii) if the termination occurs on or after the second anniversary of the Commencement Date, then the termination fee shall equal six (6) times the average monthly invoice charged to Client by Agent hereunder. For purposes of this paragraph, fees for non-recurring events shall be excluded when calculating the average monthly invoice charged to Client by Agent",

In addition to the payments required in this section, if this Agreement is terminated by Client for any reason, then Client shall pay a termination fee, due and payable to Agent.",
                "explanation": "By removing the formulas for calculating the termination fee, the contract now states that a termination fee is due under certain conditions, but doesn't specify how it's calculated. This creates an internal contradiction and uncertainty because the obligation to pay a fee exists without a defined method for determining the amount, making enforcement problematic. The mention to some calculations in the original text will be refered but it no longer exists.",

Shareholders may obtain such a bond of indemnity from a surety company of the shareholder's choice, provided the surety company satisfies Agent's minimum requirements.",
                "changed_text": "Agent shall not be obligated to issue a replacement share certificate for any share certificate reported to have been lost, destroyed or stolen unless Agent shall have received: (a) an affidavit of such loss, destruction or theft; and (c) payment of all applicable fees.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause about the 'bond of indemnity,' the section implies that replacement is possible with just an affidavit and payment. However, later, 'payment of all applicable fees' now lacks context, since the bond requirement, which likely involved a fee, is removed. This creates an contradiction, where shareholders may belive that they can follow the steps to obtain the certification, without having the appropriate steps.",

                "changed_text": "Client agrees to reimburse Agent for costs associated with collecting delinquent payments.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'attorney's fees,' the client may argue that attorney fees are not included in the cost of collecting delinquent payments. This creates an internal contradiction in future cases where an attorney is needed to collect delinquent payments, which may result in the agent having to find another source of funds.",

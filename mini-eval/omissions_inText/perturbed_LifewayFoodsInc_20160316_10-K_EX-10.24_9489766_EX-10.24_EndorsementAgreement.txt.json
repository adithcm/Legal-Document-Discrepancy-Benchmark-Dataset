                "original_text": "9. Compensation (a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway agrees to pay Individual a royalty (the \"Royalty\") equal to $0.02 for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics; provided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month. All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific royalty calculation ($0.02 per item), the agreement still mentions a Royalty but provides no clear method for calculating it. This creates an ambiguity regarding how the 'Royalty' is determined, making enforcement uncertain. A later audit could have problems reconciling payments.",

This could contradict Section 1, which grants Lifeway rights to use the Individual's likeness in 'Marketing Materials'.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase ', except as set forth in Section 9, royalty-free,', Section 1 now contradicts Section 9, which explicitly states that royalties *are* paid to the Individual. Section 1 now implies that the license granted to Lifeway is completely royalty-free, even though Section 9 establishes a royalty payment scheme. This creates a significant conflict concerning the financial terms of the agreement.",

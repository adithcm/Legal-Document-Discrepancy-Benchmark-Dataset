                "explanation": "The original text states that capital contributions are not required unless mutually agreed upon.

                "explanation": "The original text gives either Joint Venturer authority to execute instruments but provides limitations that require written consent for incurring liabilities, disposing of assets or making purchase commitments. By removing the limitations, the changed text contradicts the intended balance of power. This creates ambiguity about the extent of each venturer's unilateral authority and introduces potential conflicts over financial decisions.",

                "explanation": "By deleting the clause stating that the term shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement, and replacing it with the term shall continue indefinitely, it is not clear whether the joint venture has an end date.

                "original_text": "A.       PRICES. Prices for Produce are those set out in NETGEAR's Price List, less the applicable discount specified in Exhibit 1. All Product prices are F.O.B. NETGEAR's point of shipment, except as specified in Section 5 D.",
                "changed_text": "A.       PRICES. Prices for Products are subject to negotiation and mutual agreement between NETGEAR and Distributor. All Product prices are F.O.B. NETGEAR's point of shipment, except as specified in Section 5 D.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'NETGEAR's Price List, less the applicable discount specified in Exhibit 1,' and replacing it with 'subject to negotiation,' this change contradicts the initial listing of prices and pre-defined discount schedules in EXHIBIT 1, creating uncertainty in determining product prices.  While prices are initially said to be pre-defined, now they need to be negotiated, making enforcement ambiguous.",

Distributor should return the product to NETGEAR, [*]. NETGEAR will not accept collect shipments. Any Product returned to NETGEAR, which is not returned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, may be rejected.",

Any Product returned to NETGEAR, which is not returned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, may be rejected.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'Return Materials Authorization (RMA) number' requirement, contradicts Section 7 (Warranties) and Section 5(C) (Returns) which implicitly and explicitly describe scenarios where obtaining an RMA is necessary for returns. The term of RMA is now unreferenced, yet a main section relies on it. The phrase \"Distributor should return the product to NETGEAR, [*]\" is also modified.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'information reported under section II above', it creates a contradiction because Section 11(REPORTS) mandates that Distributor provides weekly/monthly reports on inventory of purchased products. So, If 'Proprietary Information' now does not explicitly include data from Section 11, then the confidentiality clause becomes uncertain because the Distributor is now unbound to keep the reports secure, because Section II has been removed from this section.",

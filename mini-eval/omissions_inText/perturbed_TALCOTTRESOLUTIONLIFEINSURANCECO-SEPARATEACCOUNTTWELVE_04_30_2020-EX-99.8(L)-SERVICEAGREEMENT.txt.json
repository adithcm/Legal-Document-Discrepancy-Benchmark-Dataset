                "changed_text": "In consideration of fees, Administrator agrees to perform administrative services with respect to Shares owned by Plans and included in the Accounts.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the reference to 'Schedule B' and the detailed specification of 'Services', the contract becomes vague. While Administrator is still obligated to perform 'administrative services', the exact nature of these services is no longer clearly defined within the main body of the agreement, creating uncertainty as other clauses refer to specific services without definition.",

                "changed_text": "Administrator agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Trust's administrators, investment adviser, and transfer agent, and each of their directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents and each person, if any, who controls them against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses to which an indemnitee may become subject insofar as those losses arise out of Administrator's negligence. Administrator will reimburse the indemnities for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by them in connection with investigating or defending such losses, claims or actions.",
                "explanation": "By removing specific scenarios like 'orders not timely transmitted in accordance with Section 4' and 'breach of any material representation', the scope of indemnification becomes narrower and less defined. Section 4 outlines specific duties regarding order transmission, and the removal of this reference creates an inconsistency because Administrator is still bound by Section 4 but not explicitly indemnified against its failure unless directly linked to negligence.

                "explanation": "The omission of 'the fee in effect as of the date of termination' introduces ambiguity. The original clause specifies a fixed fee based on the termination date. Without this, it's unclear how the fee is determined post-termination, which creates an inconsistency if pre-termination sections refer to a specific fee schedule that is now undefined.",

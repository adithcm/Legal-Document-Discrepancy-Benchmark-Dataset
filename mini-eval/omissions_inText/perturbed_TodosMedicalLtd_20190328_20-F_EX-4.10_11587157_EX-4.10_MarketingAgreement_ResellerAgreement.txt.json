                "original_text": "Todos shall ship ordered Products to the Reseller within ninety (90) days of Todos's acceptance of the applicable purchase order DAP Reseller's warehouse (Incoterms 2010), provided that Reseller's order for the Products does not deviate from the applicable Forecast by more than ten percent (10%).",
                "changed_text": "Todos shall ship ordered Products to the Reseller within a reasonable timeframe of Todos's acceptance of the applicable purchase order DAP Reseller's warehouse (Incoterms 2010).",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific 90-day timeframe and the deviation clause tied to the Forecast, the modified text creates uncertainty. While Incoterms 2010 is still referenced, the deletion of the clearly defined delivery schedule makes the 'reasonable timeframe' subjective and open to interpretation. This contradicts the need for specific delivery terms and introduces potential disputes. This is an omission as Section 5.1 and 5.2 still refer to 'Forecast' and 'Orders'.",

                "changed_text": "The Reseller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve commercialization milestones.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the specific reference to 'Exhibit C: Commercialization Timetable,' the modified language becomes significantly more ambiguous. The phrase 'commercially reasonable efforts' replaces the concrete, date-driven targets outlined in the missing exhibit. This creates uncertainty about the enforcement of the milestones and whether Reseller is adhering to specific dates/goals. Section 2.1 states the importance of meeting the milestones so it can be argued that this has become a contradiction within the enforcement of the milestones.",

                "original_text": "The Reseller shall be responsible for setting up at least one laboratory in the Territory to support the assay protocol (the \"Laboratory\"), including the provision of a FTIR that is approved by Todos, as further described in Exhibit B. The Reseller shall obtain the prior approval of Todos for all lab equipment. The Reseller will contract with existing certified laboratories in Israel to obtain the blood samples data, subject to the approval by Todos of each such laboratory.",
                "changed_text": "The Reseller shall be responsible for setting up at least one laboratory in the Territory to support the assay protocol. The Reseller will contract with existing certified laboratories in Israel to obtain the blood samples data.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase referring to FTIR approval by Todos, and deleting the reference 'Exhibit B' means Reseller no longer needs to obtain approval for the lab equipment or a specific lab build-out. However, 4.7 and 6.4 mentions complying with 'Todos's protocols' and quality control which implies an adherence to a laboratory design. This creates a contradiction about whether the Reseller needs to follow a specific lab structure.",

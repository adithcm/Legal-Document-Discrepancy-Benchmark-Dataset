                "original_text": "mPhase agrees to abide by the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of          this Agreement specifying the dimensions, requirements and          specifications, and the review process related to use of the Lucent          Co-Branding Logo. mPhase understands that these guidelines may be          updated from time to time and agrees to abide by those updates as well          as the guidelines provided herein.",
                "changed_text": "mPhase agrees to generally consider the guidelines related to use of the Lucent          Co-Branding Logo. mPhase will use its best effort to adhere to brand guidelines. ",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to Schedule B and changing 'abide by' to 'generally consider' and 'best effort', the contract now implies that adherence to the Co-Branding Guidelines is discretionary rather than mandatory. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original intent of strict adherence. There is no longer a review process specified.",

                "changed_text": "Lucent acknowledges mPhase's commitment to quality. mPhase will endeavor to ensure the quality of its Goods associated with the Lucent Co-Branding Logo.",
                "explanation": "The original clause established a specific quality benchmark: 'comparable to the current quality of their Goods.' By changing this to a vague 'endeavor to ensure the quality', the contract now lacks a concrete standard for quality. This omission allows for subjective interpretation and makes it difficult to enforce quality standards, especially if other areas of the contract require a specific, comparable quality.",

                "changed_text": "mPhase agrees to discuss the Approved Uses bearing the Lucent Co-Branding Logo with Lucent from time to time.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'inspect' to 'discuss' and removing the reference to Schedule B and compliance verification, the contract eliminates Lucent's right to inspect the actual use of the Co-Branding Logo for compliance. The contract no longer specifies the scope, frequency, or purpose of these 'discussions'. Since Schedule B has been neutered, this clause becomes toothless.",

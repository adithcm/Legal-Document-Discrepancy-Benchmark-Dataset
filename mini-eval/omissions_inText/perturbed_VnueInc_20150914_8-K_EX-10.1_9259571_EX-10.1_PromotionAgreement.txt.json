                "original_text": "Section 2. Promoter's Fee. For providing services as set forth herein, VNUE will compensate Promoter i) Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) for each One (1) Year contract Promoter secures per venue and Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000,00) for each Two (2) Year contract Promoter secures per venue, with payment due to Promoter within Thirty (30) Days from the date on which each such contract is countersigned; and ii) through the issuance of VNUE common stock as set forth below, and for the purposes of Rule 144 such shares of stock shall be deemed to have fully earned by Promoter upon the date of each issuance of such stock certificates by VStock Transfer:",

For providing services as set forth herein, VNUE will compensate Promoter through the issuance of VNUE common stock as set forth below, and for the purposes of Rule 144 such shares of stock shall be deemed to have fully earned by Promoter upon the date of each issuance of such stock certificates by VStock Transfer:",
                "explanation": "By removing the section detailing the cash payment per venue contract, the contract now lacks a clearly defined monetary compensation structure. This omission creates uncertainty, as the value of common stock can fluctuate, and there's no guaranteed minimum payment, which contradicts the initial premise of 'compensation' for services rendered. This makes enforcement of payment ambiguous, potentially leading to disputes over fair compensation if the stock value declines.",

                "explanation": "By removing the precise number of shares awarded, the clause becomes ambiguous and unenforceable. The obligation to award shares remains, but the lack of a specified quantity creates a contradiction, because Section 2 alludes to 'through the issuance of VNUE common stock as set forth below', but the specifics are missing. This invites disputes over the appropriate number of shares, making it impossible to determine the actual compensation without additional clarification or negotiation, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred on a weekly basis, and VNUE shall reimburse Promoter within Thirty (30) Days of receipt of such accounting.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3. Expenses. VNUE may reimburse Promoter for expenses incurred while performing the duties herein.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall reimburse' to 'may reimburse' and removing the requirements for itemized accounting and a 30-day reimbursement timeframe, the clause becomes discretionary. This creates an in-text contradiction with the initial premise of the agreement, where VNUE is expected to offer promotion services in exchange for a fee. The discretionary nature of expense reimbursement clashes with the overall compensation structure, introducing significant ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement. It can be argued that the promoter is not fairly compensated if expenses are not covered. ",

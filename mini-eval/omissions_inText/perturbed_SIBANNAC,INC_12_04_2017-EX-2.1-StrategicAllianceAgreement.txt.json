                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek *may* receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY. The payment terms will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will receive' to 'may receive' and removing the specific percentage range (10%-20%) and payment terms (NET 30), the contract introduces ambiguity regarding Bravatek's compensation. The modified text contradicts the expectation set by the original text that a lead-finder fee is guaranteed, creating uncertainty in enforcement. The removal of a specific range and payment terms makes the payment uncertain and dependent upon the sole discretion of the company. This creates an internal contradiction if other parts of the agreement rely on the certainty of the compensation structure.",

                "changed_text": "COMPANY and Bravatek agree to maintain the Confidential Information disclosed, but the details of what 'strict confidence' and 'performance of the projects' entails will be governed by each party's internal policies.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'but the details of what 'strict confidence' and 'performance of the projects' entails will be governed by each party's internal policies' to the confidentiality clause, the contract creates ambiguity. The original clause mandates 'strict confidence,' but the modified version defers to internal policies, which may or may not align with the intent of 'strict confidence.' If one party's internal policy is more lenient, it contradicts the spirit of a mutual non-disclosure agreement, creating uncertainty in enforcement. If another section speaks of mutual confidentiality, it is now contradicted.",

                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party. ",
                "explanation": "By removing the automatic renewal clause and the specifics of the 90-day written notice for both renewal and termination, the contract introduces ambiguity and uncertainty. The modified text removes the defined renewal process, making it unclear if the agreement continues after the initial 12 months. The removal of the 90-day notice for termination creates a contradiction if in Section 10 there is a reference to 'termination of this agreement after 90 days of notice'. Now, the agreement can be terminated at any time, contradicting the assumption that could be made from Section 10.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Business Day' is changed to a more generic one, while the term is still used in other sections that rely on the original definition within the Tariff. The modification creates an inconsistency and uncertainty in enforcement, particularly when calculating cure periods or deadlines referenced in the Tariff.",

If, in Carrier's reasonable judgment, an increase in Shipper's Dedicated Rates of more than ten percent (10%) would be required to place Carrier in substantially the same economic position as it was in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges or costs, Carrier may call for a meeting among the Parties' senior management to take place within thirty (30) Days of written notice to Shipper, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend the provisions of this Agreement such that the Parties are in substantially the same relative economic position as they were in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges or costs. If the Parties are unable to agree on an economic adjustment within sixty (60) Days of the senior management meeting, then Carrier may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement without penalty by delivering Shipper written notice of Carrier's intent to terminate. Such termination shall be effective, at the option of Shipper, (i) as of 9:00 a.m. on the first Day of the Month which follows the Month that Carrier delivered its notice of intent to terminate, or (ii) as of 9:00 a.m. on the first Day of the Month which is twelve (12) Months after such date, provided that Shipper's Dedicated Rates for such twelve (12) Month period before such termination shall be increased to place Carrier in substantially the same economic position as it was in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges, or costs. Shipper shall exercise such option by delivery of written notice to Carrier of Shipper's election within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of Carrier's notice to terminate, provided that if Shipper has not responded to Carrier by the time described in clause (i) above, the Agreement shall continue pursuant to clause (ii) above.",

If the Parties are unable to agree on an economic adjustment, then Carrier may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement without penalty by delivering Shipper written notice of Carrier's intent to terminate.",
                "explanation": "The detailed conditions and limitations on increasing Shipper's Dedicated Rates and the specific timelines for negotiation and termination are removed. This makes the increase of rates and the termination process very unclear, while other sections may still reference the conditions that existed before, making enforcements very difficult.",

The other sections reference to a court of competent jurisdiction and a waiver to the jury trial. This creates inconsistencies that prevent the parties from enforcing this provision.",

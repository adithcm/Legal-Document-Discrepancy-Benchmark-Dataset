Such audit may be made no more than once each Fiscal Year (unless an audit reveals a violation under this Agreement, in which case an additional audit may be conducted within such Fiscal Year); (ii) Distributor will certify to Zogenix annually in writing or otherwise upon Zogenix's written request, under the form set forth in Exhibit 10.2(b) attached hereto, Distributor's compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants in this Section 10.2, the FCPA and other Applicable Laws and Distributor's compliance policies; (iii) Distributor will inform Zogenix promptly of any changes in its business that would change any of its representations, warranties or covenants in this Section 10.2; (iv) Zogenix shall have the right to suspend or terminate the supply of Product under the Supply Agreement and to terminate this Agreement if there is credible evidence that Distributor or its Affiliate or Sub-distributor may have violated any of the representations, warranties or covenants in this Section 10.2 the FCPA or other Applicable Laws or Distributor's compliance policies.",

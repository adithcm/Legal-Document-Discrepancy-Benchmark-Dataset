Such a consumer wil l be entitled to visit a custom interactive landing page at the  CharityTunes.com website to enter the unique code and consumer's valid email address to receive downloads up to a  maximum of either three (3), five (5), or seven (7) free MP3 song downloads having a retail value of $1.29 per song or less. Charity Tunes shall make its music catalogue available to the purchasers in MP3 file format to the fullest extent that such  format is available to Charity Tunes pursuant to any agreements in effect between Charity Tunes and its wholesalers on the  date of this Agreement. Accordingly, Charity Tunes shall use its best efforts to update its music catalogue with available MP3  files by June 30, 2009.    The custom interactive landing page shall be designed, operated and maintained at the expense of Sponsor, and shall be  subject to the mutual approval by Charity Tunes and Sponsor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The landing  page shall feature the Charity Tunes logo in a size and prominence substantially equal to that of Sponsor.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies Designated Sponsor Products and limits the number of downloads based on the product purchased. The modified text removes the \"Designated Sponsor Product\" definition and the download limits. This creates an ambiguity as it is not clear for which products a pin code is valid, or how many downloads the customer receives per pin code, contradicting section 3.",

The total  number of Pin Codes to be distributed as prizes in the Promotion shall not exceed: (i) 277,760 Pin Codes containing three (3)  music downloads per Pin Code ; (ii) 130,300 Pin Codes containing five (5) music downloads per Pin Code; and (iii) 27,900 Pin  Codes containing seven (7) music downloads per Pin Code. No Designated Sponsor Product shall contain more than 1 Pin  Code per pack.    The distribution limits stated above are the maximum number of Pin Codes that may be distributed in the Promotion. No 3- song, 5-song, or 7-song Pin Codes may be subdivided, duplicated or distributed in combination with one another.    Charity Tunes agrees to generate the unique Pin Codes for the Promotion. The parties therefore understand and acknowledge  the critical need to maintain in absolute secrecy the Pin Codes generated for the Promotion such that they are only disclosed  to the appropriate recipient via the authorized distribution method described herein. If the Pin Codes are made available to the  public by Sponsor or by any of its employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, representatives or advisors, except in  the manner provided for herein, all parties agree that Pin Code security will be deemed compromised, and Charity Tunes may  terminate all subsequent Pin Code redemptions.    Sponsor agrees that it will not increase the list price to its customers of Designated Sponsor Products that form part of this  promotion as compared to its otherwise identical products that do not form part of the promotion.",

                "explanation": "By removing the distribution limits and the reference to Designated Sponsor Products, while still referencing \"the Promotion\", the scope and limitations of the promotion become unclear. It contradicts the earlier parts of the contract still specifying the number of pin codes to be printed for distribution as well as the Fee in Section 10 which are still linked to defined number of pin codes for different promotions.",

                "explanation": "By removing number of the pin codes of three (3), five (5) or seven (7), that generates a contradiction on the payment, how does the company know what amounts to pay since the volume is not well defined. The cost is not well defined on how many potential download is there since the volume is not specified and that makes the price contract less.",

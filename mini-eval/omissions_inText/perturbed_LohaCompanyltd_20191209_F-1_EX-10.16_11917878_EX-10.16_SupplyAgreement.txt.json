                "original_text": "11. PAYMENT: Under Letter of Credit or T/T: Under the Letter of Credit: The Buyer shall open an irrevocable letter of credit with the bank within 30 days after signing the contract, in favor of the Seller, for 100% value of the total contract value. The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1. The remaining 20% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.2. The Letter of Credit shall be valid until 90 days after the latest shipment is effected. Under the T/T The trustee of the buyer remitted the goods to the seller by telegraphic transfer in batches as agreed upon after signing each order.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific percentages for payment against documents (80% against 12.1, 20% against 12.2) under the Letter of Credit payment terms, the contract introduces ambiguity. Clause 12 (DOCUMENTS) is still referenced, but the specific payment milestones tied to those documents are now undefined, creating an internal contradiction.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim. The Sellers, in accordance with the Buyers' claim, shall be responsible for the immediate elimination of the defect(s), complete or partial replacement of the commodity or shall devaluate the commodity according to the state of defect(s). Where necessary, the Buyers shall be at liberty to eliminate the defect(s) themselves at the Sellers' expenses. If the Sellers fail to answer the Buyers within one weeks after receipt of the aforesaid claim, the claim shall be reckoned as having been accepted by the Sellers.",

The main issue is not on the fact that the \"China Commodity Inspection Bureau\" is missing from the modified text.",

LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty which shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days.

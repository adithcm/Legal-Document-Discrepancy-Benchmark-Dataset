Unless otherwise provided,         charges will be assessed on each unit required to transport a Shipment         at the applicable minimum weight or truckload minimum weight shown for         each Unit used.\n\n        \"Tractor\" shall mean a truck tractor.\n\n        \"Trailer\" shall mean a tank semitrailer.\n\n        \"Unit\" shall mean a truck tractor-semitrailer combination motor vehicle.\n\n        \"Vehicle\" shall mean a Tractor or a Trailer.",

                "explanation": "The original detailed definitions are replaced with vaguer terms. This creates ambiguity and contradiction when specific interpretations are required in other clauses (e.g., calculating detention charges based on specific vehicle types) because the definitions are overly simplified. For example the difference between the trailer and the truck tractor is lost in translation creating ambiguity when referencing a specific \"unit\" or \"vehicle\".",

A claim for loss, damage, injury, or delay to      cargo shall not be paid by Carrier unless filed with Carrier in writing, as      provided in subparagraph (b) below. (b) Minimum filing requirements. A claim must be filed with Carrier within     thirty (30) days from the date the shipment in question was delivered, and     (i) contain facts sufficient to identify the shipment (or shipments)     involved (ii) assert the grounds for Carrier's liability for alleged loss,     damage, injury, or delay, and (iii) request payment of a specified or     determinable amount of money. (c) Documents not constituting claims. Bad order reports, appraisal reports of     damage, notations of shortage or damage, or both, on freight bills, delivery     receipts, or other documents, or inspection reports issued by Carrier or     inspection agencies, whether the extent of loss or damage is indicated in     dollars and cents or otherwise, shall, standing alone, not be sufficient to     comply with the requirements of subparagraph (b) above. (d) Claims filed for uncertain amounts. Whenever a claim is presented against     Carrier for an uncertain amount, Carrier shall determine the conditions of     the shipment involved at the time of delivery by it, if it was delivered,     and shall ascertain as nearly as possible the extent, if any, of the loss or     damage for which it may be responsible. It shall not, however, pay a claim     under such circumstances unless and until a formal claim in writing for a     specified or determinable amount of money shall have been filed in     accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (b) above. (e) Other claims. If investigation of a claim reveals that one or more other     carriers have been presented with a similar claim arising out of or relating     to the same shipment, Carrier shall communicate with each such other     Carrier, and prior to any agreement entered into between or among them as to     the proper disposition of such claim or claims, shall notify all claimants     of the receipt of conflicting or overlapping claims and shall require     further substantiation, on the part of each claimant of its title to the     involved commodity or rights with respect to such claim.",

If investigation of a claim reveals that one or more other carriers have been presented with a similar claim arising out of or relating to the same shipment, Carrier shall handle the claim independently.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Claims in writing required' to 'Claims encouraged' and weakening other requirements, enforcement becomes highly discretionary. Original text states that claims must be filed within thirty (30) days, which is now absent from the perturbation. Original text states that delivery receipts alone are not enough to comply with claim requirements, which is now stated in the perturbation.",

Except as otherwise provided in this Item, two (2) hours will be allowed for    loading and three (3) hours will be allowed for unloading.

A charge of $50.00 per hour or    fractional part thereof shall apply for all time consumed in excess of free    time allowed for unloading when due to delays caused by Shipper or Consignee    and beyond Carrier's control.\n\n2. Shipments moving in MC-330 or MC-331 trailers will be allowed one and one-    half (1.5) hours for loading and unloading. A charge of $12.50 per half hour    or fractional part thereof shall apply for all time consumed in excess of    free time allowed when due to delay caused by Consignor or Consignee and    beyond Carrier's control.\n\n3. Loading or unloading time shall be deemed to run from the time the unit    arrives on the premises of a plant until all connections have been removed,    necessary shipping papers have been executed and the unit is released from    further assignment at that location. The exception to this computation of    time shall be when, by mutual agreement of Carrier, Consignor and Consignee,    an arrival period is accepted and not met by the Carrier. In this case, this    time shall begin at the earliest hour of the agreed arrival period if the    Carrier is early or at the time of actual hookup and beginning of unloading    if the Carrier arrives later than the agreed arrival period.\n\n4. (a) Shipments requiring stops for partial loading will be allowed one and     one-half (1.5) hours free time at each loading, including the initial     loading.    (b) Shipments requiring stops for partial unloading will be allowed one and     one-half (1.5) hours free time at each unloading, including final delivery.\n\n5.

                "explanation": "The specific time allowances and corresponding charges for detention of vehicles are removed. By replacing specific durations (e.g., 'two (2) hours') with vague terms ('reasonable time'), the agreement creates a contradiction. The original text provides precise conditions for charging detention, now absent in the perturbation.",

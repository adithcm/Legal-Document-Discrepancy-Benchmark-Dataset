                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons (as such term is defined in the Schedule 13D referred to below) on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons on behalf of each of them of a statement with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) and Schedule 13D, we remove the legal basis for the joint filing agreement. Later, the term 'Reporting Persons' is used without explicitly defining it, which introduces ambiguity and contradicts the implied reliance on SEC regulations in the original agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly delineates responsibility for accuracy. The changed text introduces 'generally responsible' and 'internally delegated,' which contradicts the original specific allocation of liability and creates potential uncertainty about who is accountable for inaccuracies, especially given the removal of the SEC rule reference previously.",

Referring to 'Authorized Representative' without specifying the signatory's name or providing a signature contradicts the implication in the first paragraph that all parties have formally and individually agreed to the terms, further amplified by the lack of explicit reference to Rule 13d-1(k)(1).",

                "explanation": "By removing the Schedule 1 reference and replacing the specific Services Agreement details with a generic 'an agreement', we create ambiguity. The Funds are no longer clearly defined by reference to a schedule, and the governing agreement's details are vague, making it difficult to ascertain which funds are covered and the exact terms governing the agency relationship between Adviser and FASC. It creates an In-Text Contradiction, as the later paragraph refers to schedule 1.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party' we remove a key exception of when the indemnification would not be applicable. This would contradict the standard legal principles that normally do not allow to indemnify a party for their negligence or misconduct. This is an in-text contradiction because the clause implies indemnification covers *all* actions, while standard legal practice usually excludes gross negligence and willful misconduct.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"or as to any Fund upon the cancellation or termination of the Adviser's Investment Advisory Contract for such Fund\", this change creates a contradiction related to termination. The original text specifies automatic termination for individual funds if their respective Investment Advisory Contracts are cancelled. By removing this, the amended text implies that the Limited Power of Attorney only terminates entirely upon cancellation of the Services Agreement, even if an individual Fund's advisory contract ends. This causes ambiguity regarding the attorney-in-fact's powers related to funds with terminated advisory contracts, thus creating an in-text contradiction.",

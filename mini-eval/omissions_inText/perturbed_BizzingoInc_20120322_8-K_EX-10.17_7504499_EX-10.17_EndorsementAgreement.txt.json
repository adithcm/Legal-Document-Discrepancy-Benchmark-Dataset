Theismann\"), nicknames, initials, autograph, facsimile signature, photograph, image, likeness, voice, video portrayals, biographical data, character, symbols, and/or other endorsement, and any variations or deviations thereof.",

                "explanation": "By significantly narrowing the definition of 'Property' to only name and likeness, we create a contradiction because other clauses may rely on the full definition (e.g., use of video portrayals). Enforcement becomes uncertain because it's unclear if the original broader definition or the new restricted one applies.",

Following the execution of this Agreement, Theismann will provide Bizzingo with an availability schedule  indicating black out and/or available dates and from time to time will endeavor to update such schedule. In this regard, Bizzingo agrees to provide  Joseph Theismann with at least thirty (30) days' written notice of any photographic sessions or public appearances to permit Theismann to  properly schedule the session or appearance. Bizzingo will pay all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by Theismann in connection with  such session or appearance which expenses shall not exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per day unless Theismann receives prior written  approval from Bizzingo. For any travel incurred by Theismann as part of his appearances, Bizzingo will provide first class air travel and hotel  accommodations.",

For any travel incurred by Theismann as part of his appearances, Bizzingo will provide hotel accommodations.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specifics of the advance notice (30 days), expense limits ($1,000), and the requirement for first-class air travel, while keeping a general reference to providing notice and accommodations, we introduce ambiguity. This creates a contradiction in the intended obligations. Earlier text may mention promotional appearances, but this modification creates uncertainty. ",

                "original_text": "The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further  described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty  Period during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated  User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users,  respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common  stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of  common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The  form of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A-l and shall be referred to as the \"Royalty Warrant.\"",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific details of the royalty being in the form of stock warrants, removing schedule A-l, the quantity based on Activated Users, the exercise price ($0.15), and the term (5 years), we introduce a significant contradiction. The original text firmly establishes a warrant-based royalty system, while the new text provides vague language about 'mutually agreed upon amount'. Section 3 refers to the Royalty calculation, directly contradicting this new provision and creating confusion about the agreed-upon compensation method.",

                "explanation": "The original definition includes 'Parts, a MES, machine types, request for price quotation (“RPQ's”), model numbers and feature types purchased by IBM under this Agreement and as further described in the Product Attachments.' By changing the definition of 'Products' to a broader definition the uncertainty increases regarding the scope of the agreement. This creates a contradiction as other sections rely on the precise definition, especially when calculating prices or handling warranties.",

MSL shall not use any proprietary processes for the assembly, subassembly and final tests, and quality testing of the Products subject to this Agreement unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing.",

                "explanation": "By removing critical details regarding IBM's ownership of inventions and processes related to IBM's processes, systems as well as removing mentions of design and documentation of products, a clear contradiction arises. This omission directly impacts Section 13.1, by not indicating who owns an invention during the assembly, subassembly and final tests, and quality testing of the Products subject to this Agreement.",

The effectiveness of this Agreement shall be subject to       the condition that IBM deliver to MSL a certificate on and as of the       Effective Date that such representations and warranties are correct and       complete as of such date.\n\n      \"To the best of IBM's knowledge\" shall be defined as the information       available to IBM Charlotte Management after due inquiry as of the       Effective Date. A materially adverse effect shall be defined as an outcome       where MSL is unable to acquire appropriate title for assets to be       purchased under this Agreement.\n\n      a)    Organization of IBM\n\n            IBM is a New York corporation, duly organized, validly existing, and             in good standing under the laws of New York. IBM has all corporate             powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,             permits, consents, and approvals required to carry on its business             as now conducted.",

                "explanation": "By removing the subsequent clauses that support IBM's warranties (a, b, c, d, e, f, g), it creates confusion about what those statements actually are, as referenced in the changed text. The original text clearly defines IBM's organization, authorization, and noncontravention. Omitting these defined warranties introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to legally enforce.",

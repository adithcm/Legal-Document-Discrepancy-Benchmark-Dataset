                "explanation": "By removing \"fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement\" from the list of expenses paid by the Trust, while Section 3 still mandates compensation for the Sponsor, an inconsistency is created. Section 2 implies the Sponsor is not compensated directly by the Trust, contradicting the payment obligation outlined in Section 3. This introduces uncertainty regarding the financial obligations of the Trust.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated.

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence \"For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information,\" the method for calculating the net asset value is undefined within the Sponsorship Agreement itself. This creates an internal contradiction because while the percentage-based fee is stated, the mechanism to define net assets value, referenced as being described in the prospectus, is removed. This makes calculating the actual fee open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"without the payment of any penalty,\" from Section 6, the contract becomes ambiguous regarding the financial implications of termination. This lack of clarity creates a potential inconsistency with other sections of the contract. If Section 3 specifies payment terms, the absence of a no-penalty clause opens the possibility of conflicting interpretations regarding obligations at termination.",

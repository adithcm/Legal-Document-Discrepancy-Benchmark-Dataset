Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century.  After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come.\"",

Gregor, chairman and chief executive officer of United National. \"After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS' system would serve our needs. The specific system is outlined in Appendix A.\"",
                "explanation": "By omitting the reference to 'TOTALPLUS (R) system' but introducing a reference to 'Appendix A' outlining the specific system creates an issue if Appendix A is not defined later in the agreement. If Appendix A is never defined, this omission creates an internal contradiction and uncertainty in understanding what 'system' the agreement pertains to. Later mentions of the 'system' would become ambiguous.",

As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National will be  liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services  during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states United National will liquidate its interest. The changed text replaces 'liquidating its interest in United Financial Services during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS' with 'evaluating its options.' The changed text does not directly contradict the liquidation, but it creates ambiguity and the suggestion that it may not be liquidating, causing an internal contradiction. Subsequent sections which presume liquidation has happened are incorrect.",

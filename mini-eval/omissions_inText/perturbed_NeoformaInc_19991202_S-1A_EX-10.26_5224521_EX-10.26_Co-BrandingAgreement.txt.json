                "explanation": "By removing the exclusion of 'Advertising that is not paid for or which is part of an overall partnering or revenue sharing arrangement and any Product Listings,' the definition now ambiguously includes these forms of advertising. This contradicts later sections (e.g., revenue sharing calculations) that depend on a clearer distinction between paid and non-paid advertising, creating uncertainty in enforcement regarding which activities are subject to the terms applied to ‘Advertising.’",

                "explanation": "By removing 'New Medical Products and Used and Excess Medical Products' from the definition of 'MEDICAL PRODUCTS NET REVENUE,' the contract becomes vague about which types of medical products are included in the revenue calculation. This omission creates a contradiction if some sections assume that only new products are considered for revenue sharing, while others might interpret it to include used or excess products. This creates enforcement challenges due to the conflicting interpretations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement that a 'Qualified Lead' must agree to place a listing on the Co-Branded Career Center or Training and Education Center, the contract now lacks a clear criterion for what constitutes a qualified lead. This omission contradicts sections (such as the payment terms related to advertising revenue based on qualified ad leads) which rely on a specific definition of what a qualified lead entails, creating uncertainty in whether a simple referral without a commitment to listing qualifies for revenue sharing or other benefits outlined in the agreement.",

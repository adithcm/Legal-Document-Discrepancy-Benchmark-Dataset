                "changed_text": "Amounts which remain unpaid for 30 days may result in immediate termination of Service. Late payment fees will be assessed according to company policy.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the late payment finance charge (1.5% per month). The modified text removes this specific charge and replaces it with a vague 'company policy.' This creates an internal contradiction because other sections might reference 'finance charges' assuming the original definition still applies, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Customer authorizes the Company to take action to recover the unpaid portion of the Reversal Liability.",
                "explanation": "The original text lists specific actions the company can take to recover unpaid reversal liabilities. By removing the specific actions and replacing them with a general statement, the contract becomes vague. This is an issue because it removes the explicit debit and collection authorizations, but Reversal Liability is still in place. Enforcement becomes uncertain because the authorized methods are no longer clearly defined, but the liability is still present.",

                "changed_text": "This Service Agreement is for an indefinite term. Either party may terminate this Service Agreement at any time with written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a clear 'Initial Term' linked to the Company's Offering. The modified text introduces an indefinite term and allows termination 'at any time.' This contradicts the concept of an Initial Term linked to the offering, creating uncertainty. It is unclear whether early termination provisions tied to the Initial Term are still valid. Future references to an 'Initial Term' become ambiguous and unenforceable because it no longer has a defined duration.",

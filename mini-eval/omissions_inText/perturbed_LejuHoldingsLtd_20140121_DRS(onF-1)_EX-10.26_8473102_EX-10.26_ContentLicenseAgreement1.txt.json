                "changed_text": "\"Change of Control\" means the acquisition of the company by another entity. Details regarding consequences of Change of Control are described in section 6.4.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Change of Control included specific details about competitor ownership and board nomination rights. The modified definition is vague and omits the specific scenarios related to competitors, creating ambiguity. Section 6.4 references 'Change of Control', creating an inconsistency in defining the threshold.",

(a) Licensor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take action against third parties in the courts, administrative agencies or otherwise, at Licensor's cost and expense, to prevent or terminate misuse, infringement, dilution, misappropriation, imitation or illegal use by third parties of the Licensed Domain Names or Licensed Content. (b) Licensee shall reasonably cooperate with Licensor in any action, suit or proceeding that the Licensor may undertake under this Section 5.1 (including, without limitation, executing, filing and delivering all documents and evidence reasonably requested by the Licensor) and shall lend its name to such action, suit or proceeding if reasonably requested by the Licensor or required by applicable Law. All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Licensee in connection therewith shall be reimbursed by the Licensor. The Licensee shall have the right to participate and be represented in any such action, suit or proceeding by its own counsel at its own expense. (c) All damages or other compensation of any kind recovered in any action, suit or proceeding undertaken under this Article V, or from any settlement or compromise thereof, shall be for the benefit of the Licensor, provided, however, that any compensation granted or awarded in light of any losses incurred by Licensee shall be for the benefit of the Licensee after Licensor's reasonable expenses for taking such action, suit or proceeding have been paid.",

The Licensee shall have the right to participate in any such action by its own counsel at its own expense.",
                "explanation": "The omission includes the detailed description of actions Licensor may take, the clauses about reimbursement of the Licensee's expenses, and how damages recovered are distributed. This creates uncertainty about the scope of Licensor's rights and obligations, and the Licensee's potential compensation. Original clause 5.1(c) has been removed, while the section still refers to Licensee's cooperation, implying a shared benefit from enforcement actions which is now undefined.",

This Agreement shall automatically be terminated as of the effective date of the termination of the Agency Agreement and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect except as set forth in Section 6.7.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to termination pursuant to Section 9.02(c)(iii) or 9.02(d)(i) of the Agency Agreement, the trigger for termination of this agreement becomes unclear. This omission introduces ambiguity since the agency agreement's clauses that were originally the reason for the termination of this agreement are no longer apparent.",

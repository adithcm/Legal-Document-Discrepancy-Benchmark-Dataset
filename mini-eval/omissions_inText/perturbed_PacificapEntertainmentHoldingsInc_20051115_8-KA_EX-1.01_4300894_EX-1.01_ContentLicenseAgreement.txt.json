                "explanation": "By removing the specific 10% revenue share and the 10-year exclusive license, the modified text creates ambiguity about the actual percentage of revenue sharing and the exclusivity of the license. This omission contradicts the PERFORMANCE section, which still mentions a minimum annual payment seemingly tied to the original 10% figure, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. Also, it has been removed all the explicit content that is going to be produced and now it speaks more ambiguously about shared revenues.",

                "explanation": "By removing the 'BINDING ARBITRATION' clause and specifying the 'AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY , THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA' and instead specifying 'MEDIATION', it introduces an internal contradiction. The REMOVED clauses creates ambiguity as now mediation does not have a governing body or an specific place to be carried. This clause now means that the mediation could occur anywhere in the world and by any means the parties decide. This contradicts the intention of a binding agreement and leaves open questions about jurisdiction and enforceability.",

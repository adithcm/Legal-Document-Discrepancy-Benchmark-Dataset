                "explanation": "By removing the 'Regulatory Standards (including cGMP where applicable) and the requirements set forth in the Quality Agreement' requirements from the definition of Conforming Product, there is now a contradiction in the contract as to what constitutes an acceptable product. Later clauses rely on Conforming Product in clauses which ensure all products follow these standards. The deletion creates uncertainty around required manufacturing and product standards.",

MediWound will notify the IIA in accordance with applicable Israeli Laws upon the commencement of Manufacture of Product by such Second Source. MediWound will provide Vericel with access to the manufacturing process and information and any and all original processes, records, and any other information required to manufacture, package and test the Product in accordance with the Specifications.

                "explanation": "By omitting the requirement to facilitate technology transfer to the Second Source and the access to the manufacturing process, the Second Source will unlikely ever be able to replicate the processes. Thus, it creates a contradiction for MediWound providing Vericel the ability to have a reliable second manufacturing source.",

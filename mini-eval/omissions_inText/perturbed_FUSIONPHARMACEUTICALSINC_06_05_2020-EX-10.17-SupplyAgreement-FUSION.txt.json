                "original_text": "2.13 \"Specifications\" shall mean the standards established in writing by the Parties for the characteristics, quality, and quality control testing of Product, and its constituents, components, and packaging, as further described in Section 4.4 below and Schedule 2, and as in effect from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "2.13 \"Specifications\" shall mean the general guidelines followed during production. Specific details are subject to change at CPDC's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Specifications' clearly indicates mutually agreed-upon written standards. The modified version introduces ambiguity by referring to 'general guidelines' that CPDC can unilaterally change. This creates uncertainty in enforcement because the basis for quality control is now subjective, contradicting later sections that assume fixed, agreed-upon specifications.",

FUSION shall have the right but not the obligation to conduct any Batch testing [***] or investigation it determines to be of value to determine compliance of Product with the Specifications and/or pursuant to any other standard imposed by law. A Batch shall be deemed to be acceptable if, upon testing, it meets the Specifications, relevant cGMP standards, all other applicable laws, rules and regulations (and any additional tests as agreed by the Parties).",
                "changed_text": "3.6 Batch Testing. FUSION may observe the Batch testing that CPDC conducts to check for compliance with internal standards.",
                "explanation": "This change removes FUSION's right to conduct its own testing and significantly limits its role. The original text grants Fusion the authority to perform independent tests based on 'Specifications' and 'any other standard imposed by law.' The modified text restricts Fusion to merely observing CPDC's tests, thus creating a discrepancy around the process used for Batch approvals and accountability.",

CPDC hereby provides a limited product warranty, and accordingly does warrant for each Batch, that the Product shipped will (i) conform with the Specifications, (ii) be manufactured, tested, processed, packed and prepared for shipment in accordance with cGMPs, and (iii) be free from defects in material and workmanship for the period from the date of manufacture to the expiry date set out on each Unit of Product packed and prepared for shipment.",

                "explanation": "The original warranty explicitly guarantees that each Batch conforms to the previously defined 'Specifications' and cGMPs. The modified version replaces this specific guarantee with vague language, saying the product will 'be handled with standard manufacturing practices.' This weakens the warranty and introduces uncertainty about the standards being applied, since now 'Specifications' have no weight.",

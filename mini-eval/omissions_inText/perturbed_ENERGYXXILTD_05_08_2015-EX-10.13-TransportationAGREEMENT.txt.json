If during any monthly accounting period, the weighted average of the BS&W on all meter tickets covering Crude Petroleum delivered to Transporter by Shipper reflects a water, sediment and other impurities content which exceeds 1%, Shipper shall pay to Transporter a handling charge as specified in the table in Exhibit A on such excess water, sediment, and other impurities to cover the treating, separation and other aspects of handling such excess water, sediment and other impurities delivered to Transporter. This explicitly excludes disposal. Transporter shall accept excess water for handling only when Shipper has made the necessary arrangements for disposal of such excess water. Shipper may dispose of its excess water by method acceptable to Transporter such as barging or trucking subject to a mutually agreed upon schedule for excess water removal by Shipper from Transporter's Grand Isle tankage. As an alternative, Shipper may request Transporter to dispose of Shipper's excess water by use of Transporter's onshore disposal wells. The fees for disposal are set forth in Exhibit A. In any event, Shipper must contact Transporter in advance at 713-351-3000 to schedule means by which BS&W will be disposed. Where no meter tickets are available or meter tickets are in Transporter's opinion unreliable, water, sediment and other impurities in the system in excess of that reported on acceptable meter tickets will be allocated in a fair and equitable manner by Transporter. Notwithstanding the fact that Transporter levies a handling charge covering excess water, sediment and other impurities content in a Crude Petroleum stream, Transporter reserves the right to reject any nomination of products other than Crude Petroleum which satisfies all quality standards, requirements and conditions set forth herein.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'as specified in the table in Exhibit A' and 'The fees for disposal are set forth in Exhibit A', it creates an in-text contradiction because it removes the reference to where the handling charge and disposal fees are located. This would create uncertainty in enforcement because now there is no way of telling what the charges will be.",

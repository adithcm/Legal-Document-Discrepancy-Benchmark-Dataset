Payment to the following individual below within 7 days upon completion and handover on the Project to VAL. No. Name Function Amount\n\n1. Ms. Chen Weijie Coordinator/Lead Developer USD100,000.00\n\n2. Mr. Zheng Qing Developer USD50,000.00\n\n3. Mr. Gu Xianwin Developer USD50,000.00",

Payment to the following individual below within a reasonable time upon completion and handover on the Project to VAL. No. Name Function Amount\n\n1. Ms. Chen Weijie Coordinator/Lead Developer USD100,000.00\n\n2. Mr. Zheng Qing Developer USD50,000.00\n\n3. Mr. Gu Xianwin Developer USD50,000.00",
                "explanation": "By changing 'within 7 days' to 'within a reasonable time,' the contract creates ambiguity regarding the payment deadline. While specific amounts are still listed, the lack of a concrete timeframe introduces uncertainty and could lead to disputes. This contradicts the intent of having fixed payment terms for the services.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase, 'and will be turned over to VAL at the conclusion of the project by Developer and after the fulfillment of all commercial obligations by the VAL', we create a contradiction because the contract states the IP is owned by VAL during the project but does not explicitly state the terms of ownership after completion. This omission introduces uncertainty about when and under what conditions the IP rights are fully transferred, or if they are at all.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase, 'up to the date of termination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis', the contract no longer defines how VAL shall compensate the Developer. This absence of the compensation conditions creates a contradiction because the document states the developer shall be compensated, but fails to define how much or the conditions required for it to occur.",

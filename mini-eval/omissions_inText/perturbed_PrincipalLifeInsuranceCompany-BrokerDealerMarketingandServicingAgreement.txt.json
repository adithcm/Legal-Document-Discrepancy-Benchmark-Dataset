Broker Dealer will itself be, or will select persons associated with it who are, trained and qualified to solicit applications for purchase and service of Annuity Contracts in conformance with applicable state and federal laws. Any such persons shall be registered representatives of Broker Dealer in accordance with the rules of FINRA and any applicable state laws, be licensed to offer the Annuity Contracts in accordance with the insurance laws of any jurisdiction in which such person solicits applications and be licensed with and appointed by Issuer to solicit applications for and service Annuity Contracts.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'trained and qualified... in conformance with applicable state and federal laws' and 'in accordance with the rules of FINRA and any applicable state laws... and appointed by Issuer', creates an omission. Other sections reference compliance with regulations, but this section no longer explicitly mandates training or qualification to that standard, creating a contradiction regarding compliance responsibility and potentially leading to uncertainty about enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'Broker Dealer agrees to pay a commission to Registered Representatives in connection with the sales or servicing of Annuity Contracts under this Agreement.' creates an omission. The exhibits will mention compensation rates for Registered Reps, but if it is not stated the broker dealer must actually pay those Registered Reps, it contradicts sections referencing Registered Rep responsibility. This leaves a large uncertainty in enforcement, as the Broker Dealer may not give commissions at all.",

In connection with the offer, sale or servicing of Annuity Contracts, Broker Dealer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Distributor and Issuer from any damage or expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees, as a result of (a) the negligence, misconduct or wrongful act of Broker Dealer or producers; (b) any violation of any securities or insurance laws, regulations or orders or (c) any actual obligation of the Affiliated Agency under terms of the agreement between Broker Dealer and the Affiliated Agency, including claims by one or more of Registered Representatives for compensation due or to become due on account of such Registered Representatives' sale or servicing of Annuity Contracts and any claims or controversy between Broker Dealer and Affiliated Agency as to rights to compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Broker Dealer shall not indemnify and hold harmless Distributor and Issuer from any damage or expense on account of the negligence, misconduct or wrongful act of Broker Dealer or producer if such negligence, misconduct or wrongful act arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact in: (i) any registration statement, including any prospectus or any post-effective amendment thereto; or (ii) any material prepared and/or supplied by Distributor or Issuer for use in conjunction with the offer or sale of Annuity Contracts, or (iii) any state registration or other document filed in any state or jurisdiction in order to qualify any Annuity Contracts under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction. The terms of this provision shall not be impaired by termination of this Agreement",

                "explanation": "By removing the entire clause 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, Broker Dealer shall not indemnify and hold harmless Distributor and Issuer from any damage or expense on account of the negligence... such state or jurisdiction.' there are issues. Other sections of the contract will state that the Issuer and Distributor are responsible for the content of the prospectus, registration statements, etc. By removing this 'notwithstanding' clause, it creates an uncertainty and potential contradiction in the indemnity obligations, particularly in scenarios where claims arise from inaccurate or misleading information within the documents prepared by Distributor or Issuer.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'misappropriation of property; unfair or deceptive practices; or comparable civil or misdemeanor allegations', the contract now provides an incomplete list of potential legal actions. If another clause states the Franchisor must disclose ALL pending legal actions, this omission creates a contradiction, limiting required disclosures and creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

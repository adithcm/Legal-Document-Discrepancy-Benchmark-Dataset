                "original_text": "Each Sponsor represents and warrants to each other Party that such Sponsor is bound by and has complied with,  and agrees that such Sponsor shall continue to be bound by and comply with, the Equity Commitment Letter and that each other Sponsor (other  than any Defaulting Sponsor) shall be entitled to enforce, or direct the enforcement of, such Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this  Agreement if and only if the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) have determined by unanimous written consent that the conditions of  the Offer have been satisfied or to waive all such conditions remaining unsatisfied. No Party shall attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment  Letter until the conditions set forth in this Section have been satisfied. Purchaser shall have no right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter  unless and until directed to do so by the unanimous written consent of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor).",

No Party shall attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter until the conditions set forth in this Section have been satisfied. Purchaser shall have no right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter  unless and until directed to do so by a majority vote of the Sponsors.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit obligation to be bound by and comply with the Equity Commitment Letter, and changing the enforcement requirement to a majority vote instead of unanimous consent from sponsors, this change introduces uncertainty regarding the enforceability of the Equity Commitment Letters and creates a contradiction with other sections that rely on the Equity Commitment Letters being legally binding. Section 3 and 6 reference the Equity Commitment Letters.",

If the Participating Sponsors unanimously consent to proceed (and whether  or not any Participating Sponsor elects to seek specific performance as against any Defaulting Sponsor in connection herewith), the amount of the  commitment of each Defaulting Sponsor shall be offered, first, to the Participating Sponsors pro rata (based on the commitments of such  Participating Sponsors), and, thereafter, as applicable, to one or more other co-investors, unanimously approved by the Participating Sponsors.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the time any Sponsor becomes a Defaulting Sponsor, the approval or consent of  such Defaulting Sponsor shall not be required for any purpose hereunder; provided,  however, that each Defaulting Sponsor that ultimately  participates in the Offer (as a result of any Participating Sponsor electing to seek specific performance as against such Defaulting Sponsor) shall  cease to be a \"Defaulting Sponsor\" and shall have approval and consent rights hereunder.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definitions of 'Participating Sponsor' and 'Defaulting Sponsor' based on compliance with the Equity Commitment Letter, and changing the basis for termination to 'any reason', we remove the link between the Sponsors obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter and the sponsorship agreement, as well as create internal contradiction. The original clause contemplates Sponsors failing to meet a funding requirement, and this is now gone.",

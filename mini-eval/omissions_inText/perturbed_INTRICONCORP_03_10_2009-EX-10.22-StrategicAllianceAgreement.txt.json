                "original_text": "DSP means digital signal processing. More specifically, for the purposes of this SAA, DSP Technology shall mean ON Semiconductor  hardware and firmware algorithms used for the HH, PADA and ALD markets. Hardware shall include the ON Semiconductor Ezairo DSP, and the  Single Chip Hearing Amplifier (SCHA) from ON Semiconductor.",
                "changed_text": "DSP means digital signal processing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'DSP Technology' specifically names ON Semiconductor hardware. Removing this definition creates uncertainty about which hardware qualifies as 'DSP Technology' in later sections, especially concerning royalty payments tied to specific platforms. This could lead to disputes about royalty obligations if IntriCon uses DSP technology from other vendors but the contract still mentions royalty rates for Base Products using 'DSP Technology' elsewhere.",

                "changed_text": "For purposes of computing payments, a transaction shall occur when IntriCon ships a Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that a 'sale' (triggering royalty) occurs upon IntriCon receiving payment. Changing this to when IntriCon ships the product creates a contradiction. IntriCon might ship products that are later returned, or for which payment is never received. Other sections referring to royalty calculations based on 'sales' now conflict with this definition, creating uncertainty about when royalties are actually due. The initial definition is what payment received from customer and not when the product ships. The change creates uncertainty when to make payments.",

                "changed_text": "IntriCon must keep records of product shipments.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates keeping records of orders received, units sold, and returns specifically to substantiate royalty payments. The modified text only requires records of 'product shipments'. This creates an inconsistency because while shipments are recorded, the contract does not specify record-keeping of returns or actual sales figures, which are essential for calculating royalties per the original intention of Section 5. The lack of comprehensive sales data will create issues during audits mentioned in the contract, as the auditor will not have the full picture of actual revenues and sales.",

The Professional agrees that, with respect to men's apparel,          he will exclusively endorse and use exclusively in play, practice,           exhibits, clinics and other events open to the media or public, Haley           brand apparel which shall consist of shirts, vests, jackets, sweaters,          pants and shorts (if permitted by applicable rules).",

                "explanation": "The phrase '(if permitted by applicable rules)' has been removed, creating a potential contradiction. Section 5 states the professional retains all other endorsement rights except apparel described in section 1. If the 'applicable rules' restricted wearing Haley apparel the professional could be in breach of contract. By removing this clause the contract is unclear if the professional can be held accountable for endorsements that violate tour rules.",

                "explanation": "The clause regarding termination due to failure to observe agreements has been removed. This contradicts the implication that both parties have obligations under the agreement, as outlined in other sections (e.g., Section 1 outlining the Professional's services and Section 3 outlining compensation). Without a clear mechanism for termination due to breach of contract by *either* party, there's uncertainty about recourse if one party fails to fulfill their obligations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the method of arbitration and further clauses, it now contradicts itself, because it provides a dispute clause, but fails to include what Arbitration method needs to be used. Therefore, there is no clarity in how disputes shall be settled, leaving the parties to not agree and go against the contract to settle outside of Arbitration",

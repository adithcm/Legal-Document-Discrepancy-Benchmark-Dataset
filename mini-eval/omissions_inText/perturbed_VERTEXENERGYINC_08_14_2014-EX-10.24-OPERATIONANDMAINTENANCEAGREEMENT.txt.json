Operator shall maintain statutory worker's  compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates' employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit. Where not prohibited by law, Operator shall waive its right of subrogation against Owner.\n\n(b)     Commercial General Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance covering its operations under this Agreement including, without limitation, bodily injury, death, property damage, premises/operations, sudden and accidental pollution, independent contractors, products/completed operations, contractual, and personal injury liability, with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the annual aggregate.\n\n(c)     Commercial Automobile Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial Automobile Insurance coverage, including, without limitation, bodily injury and property damage for owned, hired, rented, and non-owned automotive equipment with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per accident.\n\n(d)     Umbrella Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain Umbrella Liability Insurance coverage covering in excess of (a), (b), and (c) above, excluding Worker's Compensation, in the amount of ten million dollars ($10,000,000).",

                "explanation": "By removing the detailed insurance requirements (Workers' Compensation, Commercial General Liability, Commercial Automobile Insurance, and Umbrella Liability Insurance) and replacing them with a vague requirement for 'insurance coverage' determined at the operator's discretion, it creates a potential contradiction.  Section 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 still reference specific types of insurance and require the owner to be named as additional insured, but the specific policy coverages are now undefined.  This introduces uncertainty and could lead to disputes over the adequacy of the operator's insurance coverage.",

By removing the phrase \", with a fair market value exceeding $10,000 in the aggregate, provided, however that Operator is expressly permitted to terminate leases or other contracts in respect of rental equipment regardless of value.\", now it requires approval before any asset is acquired or sold, which is not correct.",

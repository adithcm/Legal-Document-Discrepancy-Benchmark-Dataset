                "original_text": "8.2 This Agreement may be terminated by the Dolphins or modified to reduce or eliminate certain promotional benefits (such as use of Marks or Sponsorship Rights), as described in Sections 2.3, 4.5 and 5.4 hereof. Upon any such termination or modification, the Dolphins will in good faith attempt to substitute a promotional benefit of equivalent promotional value for any benefits that the Dolphins was forced to eliminate; or, if the Dolphins is unable to substitute a promotional benefit of similar magnitude, then the Dolphins and Hydron shall attempt, in good faith, to agree upon an adjustment in the amount of fees payable by Hydron to the Dolphins under this Agreement. If the Dolphins and Hydron cannot agree upon an adjustment in the amount of fees payable hereunder, then Dolphins and Hydron agree to arbitrate the adjustment in fees and to be bound by the decision of the arbitrators. Any such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.",

If the Dolphins and Hydron cannot agree upon an adjustment in the amount of fees payable hereunder, then resolution of fees will be at the sole discretion of the Dolphins.",
                "explanation": "By removing the good faith requirement to substitute an equivalent promotional value and stating Dolphins will attempt to provide a promotional benefit without quantifying it creates uncertainty. Furthermore, arbitration is removed, and fee resolution falls to the sole discretion of one party. This directly contradicts the initial intention of mutual agreement on the value of benefits or compensation.",

                "original_text": "3.2 In the event that the consideration is not paid by Hydron on or before the applicable payment due date, said failure to pay shall be considered a material breach by Hydron, and the Dolphins may elect to charge Hydron a late fee of 1.5% per month of the payment then due and owing until it is paid in full. The Dolphins agree to provide written notice to Hydron of the failure to receive any payment, and Hydron shall have a five (5) business day period following delivery of written notice in which to cure the payment default before the Dolphins may elect to terminate this Agreement and pursue applicable remedies. It is agreed by Hydron that any such election of remedies does not waive any other remedies for breach of contract available to the Dolphins.",

It is agreed by Hydron that any such election of remedies does not waive any other remedies for breach of contract available to the Dolphins.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specifics of the late fee percentage (1.5%) and the cure period after notice, the clause becomes ambiguous. Other sections may still assume a 1.5% late fee or a cure period after a written warning, which are no longer contractually defined, leading to disagreement in enforcement.",

                "original_text": "7.2 Insurance. The Dolphins shall, at its own expense, maintain in effect throughout the term of this Agreement, comprehensive general liability insurance policies with carriers of recognized standing, with limits of liability of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), governing any and all property damage and person injury (including death) arising out of activities covered by this Agreement. Hydron shall, at its own expense, maintain in effect throughout the term of this Agreement, comprehensive general liability insurance policies with carriers of recognized standing, with limits of liability of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), covering any and all property damage and personal injury (including death) arising out of activities covered by this Agreement and shall obtain and maintain such additional insurance coverage as the Dolphins shall reasonably require with respect to any Sponsored Events or similar activities.",

Hydron shall maintain general liability insurance policies and shall obtain and maintain such additional insurance coverage as the Dolphins shall require with respect to any Sponsored Events or similar activities.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for 'comprehensive' policies, specific coverage limits of 'at least One Million Dollars', and the 'carriers of recognized standing,' the modified clause introduces uncertainty about the level and quality of insurance required. If another section references insurance coverage in the context of indemnification, it is now unclear what level of coverage is expected, thus creating an internal contradiction.",

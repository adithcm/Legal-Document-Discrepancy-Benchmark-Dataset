                "explanation": "The original definition specifically limits the Company Field to solid hardwood and engineered wood flooring. By removing 'design, development, manufacture, marketing, promotion, advertising, sourcing, distribution and sale of solid hardwood and engineered wood', the new definition becomes vague and can now be interpretted more broadly. This creates uncertainty since other sections relying on the specific definition in Section 1.1(o) (e.g., the scope of licensed IP) are no longer clearly defined.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Arizona hereby grants to the Company a limited, non- exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth in Section 7.1), non-assignable license in, to and under the Arizona Licensed Trademarks for the Arizona Trademark License Term for use in the Company Field throughout the world only in the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in the form set forth on Schedule 6.1.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase 'only in the form and manner that such Arizona Licensed Trademarks are used in the Business as of the Closing, provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present the Arizona Licensed Trademarks in the form set forth on Schedule 6.1', the contract creates ambiguity regarding the permitted use of the licensed trademarks. Later section 6.3 discusses Quality Control and acknowledges the importance of Arizona's exercise of quality control over the use of the Seller Licensed Trademarks. Section 6.3(a) requires that goods and services provided by the Company under the Seller Licensed Trademarks, be substantially the same or greater quality than goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date. Without a required from and manner, it introduces uncertainty in the enforcement of quality control measures relating to those trademarks and could allow the company to freely rebrand.",

                "explanation": "By omitting '(i) with respect to the Arizona Licensed Trademarks, be for the Arizona Trademark License Term, (ii) with respect to the Diamond Licensed Trademarks, be for the Diamond Trademark License Term, (iii) with respect to the Phase- Out Marks, be for the term set forth in Section 6.6, and (iv) with respect to Copyrights, Know-How and Patents,', the section removes the time-limited scope of key trademarks licensed under the agreement. This creates a contradiction because Section 6.1 and 6.2 reference a term limit (Arizona Trademark License Term and Diamond Trademark License Term). This raises questions about the license's validity and enforceability after the original term and before termination.",

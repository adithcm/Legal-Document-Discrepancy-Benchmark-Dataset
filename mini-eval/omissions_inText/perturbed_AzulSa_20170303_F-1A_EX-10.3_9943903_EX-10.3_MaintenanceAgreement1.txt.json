WORK ORDERS\n\nDuring the Term, the Company shall use the appropriate Work Order form (Exhibit 7 \"Repairer Standard Work Order Forms\"), depending on the nature of the Service requested, and send the Work Order to the Repairer according to the notice details below or any other contact the Repairer may from time to time notify to the Company.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Exhibit 7 Repairer Standard Work Order Forms' and the requirement to use the 'appropriate' form based on the 'nature of the Service requested', it introduces ambiguity and contradiction. Other sections referring to specific work order forms in Exhibit 7 now lack context, creating uncertainty about how services should be requested.",

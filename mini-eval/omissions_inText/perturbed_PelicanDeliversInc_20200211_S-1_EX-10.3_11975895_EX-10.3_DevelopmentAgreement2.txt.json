                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to 'APPENDIX A hereto' containing the Statement of Work (SOW) and replacing it with 'general project goals,' the contract now lacks a clearly defined specification document. Subsequent sections that rely on the SOW for details like 'Delivery Schedule; Acceptance; Change Orders' will become ambiguous and unenforceable, creating an internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'pursuant to the Fee payment schedule provided in a SOW hereto (the Fee Payment Schedule),' the contract no longer specifies how fees are to be paid. This creates a contradiction because Section 5.1 still refers to 'Fees...as Described in the SOW', however the definition of Fee Payment Schedule, referencing SOW, is removed. This omission creates uncertainty about payment terms and schedule and contradicts the later mention of Fees in SOW.",

                "explanation": "By removing references to 'any SOW,' the applicability of termination obligations to individual Statements of Work is now ambiguous.

                "changed_text": "4.1 servicing and inspections will be conducted periodically, as determined by SEV. The specific forms for inspections may vary.",
                "explanation": "By removing the direct reference to 'Schedule One' for service intervals and FTA/SEV forms, and instead vaguely stating 'periodically, as determined by SEV' and 'forms for inspections may vary,' introduces an omission that contradicts the contract's intent for standardized, scheduled services. This creates uncertainty, especially if Schedule One still exists and is referenced elsewhere for maintenance charges based on vehicle type and service interval.",

                "changed_text": "9.3 use its reasonable endeavours to conduct periodic checks on the Vehicles as they see fit. These checks should include maintaining fluid levels. Detailed records are optional.",
                "explanation": "By omitting 'Code of Practice,' and stating 'periodic checks as they see fit' and making 'detailed records optional' creates contradiction because the original statement indicates a standard operating procedure where there is a required daily checklist according to the 'Code of Practice' which has now been omitted. The word 'optional' creates uncertainty when it comes to enforcement. The lack of daily requirement can lead to disputes about adherence to safety and maintenance standards, if the Code of Practice is still in other contract sections.",

                "changed_text": "3.5 Maintenance Charges may be increased annually. The amount of the increase, if any, will be determined at SEV's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the clear link to the 'Retail Price Index' and 'Schedule One', stating instead that increases are discretionary to SEV, removing the clear calculation formula. While the original text indicated an objective, predictable increase, the modified text introduces uncertainty, as the increase is no longer tied to a specific index or schedule. This creates a contradiction because DCL's financial year exists and references Schedule One in other contract sections.",

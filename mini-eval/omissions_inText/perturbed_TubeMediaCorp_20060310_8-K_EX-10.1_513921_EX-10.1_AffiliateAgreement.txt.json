                "explanation": "The definition of \"Acquired Station\" is modified by removing 'Broadcast Television', implying that it could be any type of station, not just Broadcast Television. This contradicts Section 3(a) which grants rights exclusively via Broadcast Television and the overall context of the agreement, which centers on Broadcast Television. This creates uncertainty as to whether non-broadcast stations acquired by Affiliate are subject to the agreement's terms.",

Except for the Local Advertising and advertising broadcast in Local Programming, Network shall have the exclusive right and authority to sell all of the advertising on the Service and shall share a portion of Network's Advertising Revenue generated from such sales with Affiliate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. A Station will not be obligated to broadcast advertising that does not comply with the Station's generally applicable broadcast standards. Network and Affiliate will cooperate in a good-faith effort to ensure that all Network advertising meets Stations' broadcast standards. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Network will not accept political or controversial-issue advertising, or advertising promoting distilled spirits or gambling, without Affiliate's prior written approval.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'and shall share a portion of Network's Advertising Revenue generated from such sales with Affiliate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement' is removed. This creates a contradiction because Section 6(b) and Exhibit D still reference and elaborate on the revenue-sharing arrangement. Without the explicit statement in Section 4(e), the legal basis for the revenue share is weakened, leading to potential disputes over payment.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'Provided they do not infringe the marks of Affiliate or an affiliate of Affiliate' is removed. Now the affiliate is required to reasonably cooperate with the Network's quality control regardless of the infringements it may pose on the Affiliate's original marks. This creates a contradiction because section 8 (e) provides for quality control, monitoring and inspection of the use of marks, therefore the Affiliate is responsible to reasonably cooperate with the network's quality control.",

It creates ambiguity in enforcing warranty claims. This leads to contradiction later in the document as there would be no clear baseline to measure the products' performance against.",

Upon the termination of DIALOG's right to manufacture the Licensed Products following any expiration or termination of the Agreement or any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period, as applicable, then all right, title and interest in the Tooling will automatically transfer to ENERGOUS subject to any Third Party IP, and DIALOG will, at ENERGOUS' option, either sell any Tooling in its possession to ENERGOUS at cost or destroy the Tooling and certify in writing as to same.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the clause 'and DIALOG will, at ENERGOUS' option, either sell any Tooling in its possession to ENERGOUS at cost or destroy the Tooling and certify in writing as to same,' there is no longer a defined procedure for what happens to the tooling post-termination. This omission creates an inconsistency because Section 3.1 still grants DIALOG rights related to Manufacturing Subcontractors utilizing ENERGOUS' Tooling. Now, at termination, DIALOG is not obligated to hand over the toolings, potentially leaving Energous with a right that it cannot exercise.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the clause 'including any software updates if any. The above warranties are valid for a period of [***] from the date of shipment of any Licensed Product to any customer', the duration of the warranty becomes undefined. Without a defined period, there is no clarity on how long ENERGOUS is liable for the warranties it provides. Since 11.2 (a) guarantees, these have unlimited time, which does not make sense. This also contradicts the intention of section 4.1 (d) in which there is a detailed agreement on rights and responsibilities relating to warranty claims, and by doing so makes the enforcement of warranty claims nearly impossible.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"The revenue share for the Program is stated in Exhibit B\", the contract now references a dispute mechanism for revenue share without specifying how that revenue share is calculated or determined. This creates uncertainty about the payment structure and what the Producer is entitled to dispute. Other clauses mention 'revenue share' making it unclear how this is derived.",

                "changed_text": "",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause \"The Program will conform to and be delivered in accordance with Exhibit A.\" creates an issue because there is no longer a deliverable guideline that exists. This creates uncertainty in delivery, and also makes the execution vague. The contract still implicitly references content delivery parameters, but these are undefined.",

                "changed_text": "it shall endeavor to deliver high-quality content.",
                "explanation": "By changing the clause \"it shall comply with the Producer Performance Standards set forth in Exhibit C.\" with \"it shall endeavor to deliver high-quality content.\", creates an internal contradiction because Exhibit C may contain provisions that differ from \"high-quality content.\" This weakens enforceability because the new language is subjective, while other sections might assume specific performance standards exist. 'Endeavor' also provides no obligation.",

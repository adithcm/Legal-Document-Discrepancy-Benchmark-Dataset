                "explanation": "The definitions of key terms have been weakened, made ambiguous, or removed specifics. For example, 'Distribution' is now based on 'internal guidelines' instead of the 'Prospectus'. 'Securities Commissions' means relevant regulatory bodies, instead of meaning the Alberta Securities Commission and the British Columbia Securities Commission. 'Special Warrants' is now described as warrants instead of the outstanding special warrants of the Issuer each such special warrant entitling the acquisition of one common share and one non-transferable share purchase warrant to purchase one additional common share in the capital of the Issuer, creating ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement, because another section may reference the original terms.",

APPOINTMENT OF SPONSOR 2.1 Appointment of Sponsor The Issuer appoints the Sponsor as sponsor of the Offering and the Sponsor accepts the appointment and agrees to act as sponsor of the Issuer under the Prospectus on the terms of this Agreement. 2.2 Duties of Sponsor As sponsor of the Issuer under the Prospectus, the Sponsor will conduct an investigation of the organization, management, business and affairs of the Issuer sufficient, in its sole discretion, to enable it to determine whether or not it is able to sign the certificate of the Prospectus. 2.3 Signature of Certificate If, following the investigation referred to in subsection 2.2, the Sponsor determines in its sole discretion that it is able to do so, the Sponsor will sign the certificate for the Prospectus, certifying that, to the best of its knowledge, the Prospectus contains full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the Securities. 2.4 Review of Business The Issuer will provide, or cause to be provided, to the Sponsor, its counsel and its agents a reasonable opportunity to conduct such full and comprehensive review of its business, capital, finances, operations and principals as the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, considers reasonably necessary in the circumstances. 2.5 Sponsor's Fee For the services of the Sponsor as sponsor of the Offering and as full and complete compensation therefor, the Issuer will pay to the Sponsor the sum of $32,100 (inclusive of Goods and Services Tax), the receipt of which is acknowledged by the Sponsor.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'under the Prospectus' from the appointment and duties clauses creates ambiguity about the scope of the sponsorship. Replacing 'certificate of the Prospectus' with 'certificate for regulatory compliance' weakens the Sponsor's liability regarding the Prospectus, contradicting sections that rely on the Sponsor's due diligence regarding the Prospectus. Omitting the specific fee amount and replacing it with 'The Issuer will compensate the Sponsor' creates uncertainty about the payment terms, which could be referenced in termination clauses.",

INDEMNIFICATION 8.1 Indemnification of Indemnified Parties The Issuer shall and does hereby indemnify and save the Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any liability, claim, demand or loss, excluding loss of profits, which the Indemnified Parties may suffer, whether pursuant to statute or otherwise, howsoever arising, in consequence of: AG2432.386 [097] - 11 - (a) any statement or omission in the Prospectus, or otherwise made or omitted by the Issuer in connection with the Offering, being or being alleged to be a misrepresentation; (b) the Issuer not complying with any requirement of applicable legislation of Canada or of British Columbia or Alberta; or (c) any order made or any inquiry, investigation or proceeding commenced, threatened or announced by any securities regulatory authority or other competent authority in British Columbia, Alberta or Ontario which prevents or restricts trading in or the sale or distribution in British Columbia and Alberta of the Securities. 8.2 Right to Counsel If any claim contemplated by this section is asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties, the Issuer shall be entitled (but not required) to assume the defence on behalf of the Indemnified Parties of any suit brought to enforce such claim, provided that the defence shall be through legal counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Parties and no admission of liability shall be made by the Issuer or the Indemnified Parties without, in each case, the prior written consent of all the parties hereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Any of the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defence thereof, at the expense of the Issuer. 8.3 Indemnity The indemnity provided for in this section will not be limited or otherwise affected by any other indemnity obtained by the Sponsor from any other person in respect of any matters specified in this Agreement and will continue in full force and effect until all possible liability of the Sponsor arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has been extinguished by the operation of law.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specifics of what the Indemnified Parties are protected from (misrepresentations in the Prospectus, non-compliance with securities laws, etc.) significantly weakens the indemnification clause, creating uncertainty in enforcement, other clauses may be reliant on these specifics. Eliminating the condition that the Issuer's choice of counsel must be 'acceptable to the Indemnified Parties' and that consent for admissions of liability cannot be 'unreasonably withheld' reduces the Indemnified Parties' control over their defense. Changing 'at the expense of the Issuer' to 'at a mutually agreed expense' introduces ambiguity and requires further negotiation for each claim, contradicting the original intent of indemnification. Removing 'until all possible liability of the Sponsor arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has been extinguished by the operation of law' weakens this section.",

                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A. Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A. Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor some monies payable by Master Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'all monies' to 'some monies', the contract becomes ambiguous. While Guarantors are still responsible for payments, the exact amount is no longer clearly defined, potentially contradicting the intent of the agreement. Other sections refer to 'the obligations,' creating uncertainty about what is being guaranteed. The amount is not specified anymore, leading to a conflict.",

                "original_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated. In the event of any conflict of law, the laws of such state shall prevail, without regard to the application of such state's conflict of law rules. If, however, any provision of this Guarantee would not be enforceable under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and if the Master Franchisee's franchised business is located outside of such state and such provision would be enforceable under the laws of the state in which the Master Franchisee's franchised business is located, then such provision shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of that state. Any action brought to enforce or interpret this Guarantee in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the county and state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and Guarantors hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
                "changed_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted under laws deemed appropriate by the Franchisor. Guarantors waive all questions of personal jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "By removing specific guidelines about which state laws govern the agreement and granting Franchisor broad discretion, this clause creates a significant contradiction. Previously the governing law was somewhat defined. Now, the interpretation is arbitrary, contradicting clauses that assume a consistent legal framework. This is coupled with removing venue specification. The removal of venue weakens the agreement because it is no longer fixed and can change according to the franchisor's determination.",

                "changed_text": "B. Guarantors guarantee some level of performance by Master Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "The alteration from 'full performance and discharge of all obligations' to 'some level of performance' introduces ambiguity and directly contradicts the original intention of an unconditional guarantee. Other clauses refer to the 'Guarantors' obligations,' but the extent of these obligations is now unclear. This undermines the enforceability of the guarantee.",

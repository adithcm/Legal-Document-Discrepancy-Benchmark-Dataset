Agent shall use its best efforts to promote Kallo and its products and service and shall promptly report and follow up all leads provided.

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'Agent may not offer or promote competitive products without the consent of Kallo.', we create a contradiction if, for example, section 3(f) states that Agent agrees to market Kallo exclusively. Now, the agent's obligation is uncertain, raising enforceability issues.",

Upon delivery of the system the Agent is responsible for getting the signed EULA from the customer before the  installation process starts.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit payment percentages and replacing it with 'as per mutually agreed terms', while Schedule A still lists specific percentages, creates a contradiction. Enforcement becomes challenging as the main body lacks specifics.",

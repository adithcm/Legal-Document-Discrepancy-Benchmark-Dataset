                "explanation": "The original definition includes a provision for 'a mutually agreed discount percentage' that is removed in the modified version. However, the term 'Add-On Software Modules' is still used elsewhere in the contract with reference to discounts, creating a contradiction. This creates uncertainty as to whether a discount applies and how it's determined.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a 45 day notice period before a price list change is effective. By removing this clause, WGT can change prices immediately. This creates an internal contradiction if other clauses assume a stable price list for forecasting or minimum purchase calculations.",

Payment of such finance charges will not excuse or cure Distributor's breach or default for late payment. If WGT retains a collection agency, attorney or other person or entity to collect overdue payments, all collection costs, including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees, will be payable by Distributor.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies an interest rate of 1.5% per month for late payments. By removing this rate, the contract is left ambiguous as to how the finance charge will be determined. This is a contradiction because other sections of the contract rely on defined financial terms, and the lack of a specific rate creates uncertainty.",

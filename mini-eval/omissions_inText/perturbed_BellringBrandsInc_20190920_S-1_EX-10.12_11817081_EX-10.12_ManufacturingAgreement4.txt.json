                "changed_text": "The Parties hereby agree to remove Schedule C-1 in its entirety.",
                "explanation": "Removing the replacement clause for Schedule C-1, while the agreement still refers to Schedule C-1 in other sections (specifically mentioning incorporating it into the agreement), creates a contradiction. There's no longer a defined Schedule C-1, but the contract implies its existence, leading to uncertainty regarding the obligations or terms that were previously defined in that schedule.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'covenants' from the section stating which parts of the original agreement remain in effect, there is now uncertainty as to whether previous covenants are still enforceable, especially if those covenants relied on Schedule C-1 or other amended sections. This is because if other sections still reference 'covenants', but this amending statement removes them, there will be issues surrounding how to enforce covenants.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'conditions' from this section, there is now uncertainty if previous conditions are still enforceable, especially if those conditions relied on Schedule C-1 or other amended sections. This introduces an internal contradiction because while the original agreement had conditions, the amendment now seemingly ignores them.",

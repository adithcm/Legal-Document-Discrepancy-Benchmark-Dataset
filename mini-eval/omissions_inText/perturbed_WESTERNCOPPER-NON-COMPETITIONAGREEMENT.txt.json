                "changed_text": "Area of Non-Competition means the State of Zacatecas, Mexico",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'area extending 20 kilometers...' definition, enforcement becomes uncertain. Later clauses reference 'Area of Non-Competition' without clearly defining its spatial extent, leading to ambiguity. This creates an in-text contradiction as the contract implies a defined area, but only specifies the state.",

For a period of 30 days from the time of delivery of the Disposition Notice Glamis will, if requested by Western Silver, entertain an offer from Western Copper to acquire the Designated Mineral Property. In the ease of a Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to dispose of for cash consideration, the parties will negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable agreement for the sale to Western Copper of the [Designated Mineral Property. If Glamis and Western Copper are unable to negotiate an acceptable agreement with respect to the Designated Mineral Property within the 30 day period, Glamis may thereafter dispose of the Designated Mineral Property as it sees til in its absolute discretion. If Glamis does not dispose of the Designated Mineral Property within a period of 3 months from the first to occur of the date that Glamis and Western Copper acknowledge failure to negotiate an acceptable agreement with respect to the Designated Mineral Property and the end of the 30 day period, the provisions of this section 2.2 will once again apply to any intended disposition of the Designated Mineral Property by Glamis. In the case of a Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to abandon, Glamis wall, if requested by Western Copper, transfer such Designated Mineral Property to Western Copper at no cost save and except for the reasonable costs of transfer incurred by Glamis.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the details regarding the Disposition Notice and the 30-day negotiation period introduces uncertainty and a potential contradiction. The modified clause states Glamis will 'notify' Western Copper, but removes any specifics of the 'Disposition Notice' requirements, the timeline for response or negotiation, making it difficult to enforce the right of first offer. This contradicts the implied intent of the original clause to provide a structured opportunity for Western Copper to acquire the property.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific conditions under which Western Copper can terminate the agreement, the modified text creates ambiguity. The original clause lists specific events of default allowing termination, while the modified clause allows termination with only written notice. This could be interpreted as allowing termination for any reason, contradicting the need for specific grounds outlined elsewhere in the agreement regarding adherence to covenants. Other clauses that reference remedies dependent on valid termination would be subject to dispute.",

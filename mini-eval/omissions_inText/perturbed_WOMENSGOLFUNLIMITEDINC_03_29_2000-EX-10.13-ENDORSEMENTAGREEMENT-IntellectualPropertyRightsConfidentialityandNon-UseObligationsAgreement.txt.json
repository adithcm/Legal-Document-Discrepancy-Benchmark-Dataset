The Professional acknowledges her obligations under the provisions of the Intellectual Property Rights Confidentiality and Non-Use Obligations Agreement attached hereto as \"Exhibit A\" and made a part hereof by this reference. The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A shall survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement, regardless of cause or circumstances of the termination or expiration.",
                "changed_text": "11.7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE. The Professional acknowledges her general understanding regarding intellectual property rights, confidentiality and non-use. Specific details regarding these obligations may be outlined in separate internal documents. The rights and obligations of the parties related to intellectual property survive termination or expiration.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit reference to 'Exhibit A' and replaces it with a vague reference to 'separate internal documents'. This creates an internal contradiction if Exhibit A, detailing specific obligations, is missing or incomplete elsewhere, because the agreement continues to suggest such obligations exist, but provides no clear way to determine them. The change impacts the enforceability of specific confidentiality and non-use obligations, because without Exhibit A, the exact scope of these obligations becomes unclear.",

Recipient hereby assigns and agrees to assign all Recipient's rights in any Intellectual Property to the Company. Recipient hereby grants to the Company power of attorney for the purpose of assigning all Recipient's rights in Intellectual Property to the Company for the purposes of filings, registrations and other formalities deemed necessary by the Company to prosecute, protect, perfect or exploit its ownership and interests in Intellectual Property. Recipient further agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver any documentation, instruments, specifications or disclosures necessary to assign, prosecute, protect, perfect or exploit the Company ownership of Intellectual Property.",

Recipient agrees to discuss assigning rights related to these inventions to the Company. Recipient agrees to cooperate in good faith regarding any necessary documentation.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit assignment of all Intellectual Property to the Company and replaces it with a requirement for 'further negotiation'. By deleting the original clause which states that ALL discoveries are property of the company. The modified clause now suggests that ownership of inventions will be determined later through negotiation, which contradicts the initial agreement in principle, introducing uncertainty and potential for disputes. This significantly weakens the Company's position regarding IP ownership, because if another section still refers to IP being owned by the company, there is an apparent conflict. The original text stated it would be a work for hire.",

Accordingly, Recipient hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal and County Courts in Essex County, New Jersey and agrees that the Company may seek temporary restraining orders against it or other extraordinary relief necessary to protect the Information.",
                "changed_text": "(g) Recipient acknowledges that the Company considers some of its information to be confidential.  The parties agree to attempt to resolve any disputes through mediation before resorting to legal action.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit acknowledgement of the Company's proprietary information and the agreement to jurisdiction in Essex County, New Jersey. It introduces a requirement for mediation instead of directly consenting to legal action and TROs. If another section of the overall contract details a process for seeking immediate injunctions in Essex County for IP breaches, this modified clause contradicts that process by mandating mediation first. This weakens the Company's ability to quickly protect its confidential information through legal means and increases the risk of damage due to delayed action, thus making the entire contract inconsistent.",

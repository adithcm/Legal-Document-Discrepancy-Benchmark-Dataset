                "changed_text": "\"Base Salary\" means the Employee's total salary as determined by the Employer.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Base Salary' provides a specific calculation method. The modified definition is ambiguous, leaving the determination of the base salary solely to the Employer's discretion. This contradicts Article IV which uses 'Base Salary' to determine the death benefit, creating uncertainty in the benefit calculation.",

The Employer shall be the beneficiary of the remaining death proceeds of the policy after the Employee's interest is determined. Within 60 days after the death of the Employee, the Employer will provide to the \"Insurer\" a written statement indicating the amount of each policy's proceeds the Employee's beneficiary is entitled to receive.",

                "explanation": "The original Article IV defines exactly how the beneficiary proceeds will be paid out, namely 'the lesser of (a) (two (2) times the Employee's annualized base salary at the time of death as provided by the Employer's payroll department) plus $100,000, reduced by any amount payable under the Employer's group term life insurance plan, or (b) the Net Amount At Risk'. The changed text removes this definition of proceeds and instead gives the Employer discretion to determine that amount at the time of death.

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that the Employer must make the policies available for beneficiary changes. By removing this, the Employee's right to change the beneficiary is impaired, contradicting the 'Split Dollar Policy Endorsement Beneficiary Designation' section on page 6, which grants the Employee the right to change the beneficiary. This creates uncertainty regarding the Employee's rights and makes the agreement ambiguous to enforce.",

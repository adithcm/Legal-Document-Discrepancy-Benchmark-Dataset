In order to maintain the exclusive rights to sell, lease, distribute and service Products in the Market, the Distributor must use all commercially reasonably efforts to purchase for sale to subdistributors the following minimum quantities of the Products from the Company:\n\nOn the commencement of the Term Distributor will issue to the Company an irrevocable letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. The LC shall have a two (2) month term, and shall be renewed for five (5) consecutive bimonthly periods. A minimum of a $250,000.00 purchase order must be received by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month period.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific purchase quantities and the irrevocable letter of credit terms, the modified text creates uncertainty regarding the minimum purchase obligations of the Distributor. This contradiction makes it difficult to determine whether the Distributor is meeting its contractual obligations, potentially leading to disputes over the exclusivity of the distribution rights.",

Neither e-details, nor presentations made at conventions, exhibit booths, a sample drop, educational programs or speaker meetings, or similar gatherings, shall constitute a Detail.",
                "changed_text": "1.19 \"Detail(s)\" shall mean any form of Product presentation to a Target Professional or a Sales Representative, during which the Product's attributes, benefits, prescribing information and safety information are presented for use in the Field in the Territory. This may include, but is not limited to, face-to-face sales calls, e-details, presentations made at conventions, exhibit booths, sample drops, educational programs, speaker meetings, or similar gatherings.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Detail(s)\" explicitly excludes e-details and presentations at conventions, etc. The modified definition broadens this to include all such forms of presentations. This creates an internal contradiction because subsequent clauses that rely on the original definition (e.g., those calculating the 'aggregate actual number of Details') will now be ambiguous. The definition is broad and it creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, [***]) and continuing throughout the remainder of the Term, Valeant shall maintain at least one hundred (100) Sales Representatives with responsibility to Detail the Product in the Specialty in the Territory. Notwithstanding the above, the sole remedy of Dova for breach of this Section 4.1.2 shall be (i) the adjustment to the promotion fee as set forth in Section 6.1.2 and (ii) the termination right set out in Section 12.2.2.",
                "changed_text": "4.1.2 Number of Sales Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, [***]) and continuing throughout the remainder of the Term, Valeant shall maintain a sales force to Detail the Product in the Specialty in the Territory. The size and composition of this sales force shall be determined at Valeant’s sole discretion. Notwithstanding the above, the sole remedy of Dova for breach of this Section 4.1.2 shall be (i) the adjustment to the promotion fee as set forth in Section 6.1.2 and (ii) the termination right set out in Section 12.2.2.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific 'one hundred (100) Sales Representatives' requirement and stating the size is at 'Valeant’s sole discretion', the clause becomes contradictory. Section 6.1.2 still references adjustments to the promotion fee based on a minimum number of sales representatives, but Section 4.1.2 no longer guarantees that minimum. This creates uncertainty in how the promotion fee is calculated and whether Dova can enforce a specific sales force size. This introduces uncertainty and would affect the promotion fee.",

For initial orders of Product from Dova (or its Affiliates or its Intermediaries) to the Non-Retail Institutions, Dova shall not engage in any \"channel stuffing\" or any similar program, activity or other action (including any rebate, discount, chargeback or refund policy or practice) that in each case is intended by Dova to result in purchases by the Non-Retail Institutions that are materially in excess of purchases in the ordinary course of business or that is intended to materially adversely impact Valeant's promotion fee pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, this Section10.4.1 shall not be applicable to any activity or action taken by Dova which applies to all or substantially all customers for the Product, or any activity or action taken by Dova in good faith and consistent with customary sales and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry.",

Without a concrete definition of what activities are restricted, it's difficult to determine if Dova is violating the clause. The new clause only prohibits activity that adversely impacts Valeant's promotion fee, but does not describe what activity.",

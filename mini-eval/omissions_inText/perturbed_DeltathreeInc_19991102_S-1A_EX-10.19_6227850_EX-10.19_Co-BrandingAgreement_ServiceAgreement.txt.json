                "original_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the \"DeltaThree Network\" shall mean Internet Protocol (IP) communications services, which utilize the Internet and networks, based on IP to provide telecommunications products and services. It is fully understood that the Calling Card is a DeltaThree product and accordingly all revenues derived therefrom will inure to the benefit of DeltaThree.",
                "changed_text": "It is fully understood that the Calling Card is a DeltaThree product and accordingly all revenues derived therefrom will inure to the benefit of DeltaThree.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the definition of \"DeltaThree Network\" makes it unclear what constitutes the DeltaThree Network. This is important because Section 2.01 states that both parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to increase the percentage of traffic derived from the use of the Calling Card which will be carried via the DeltaThree Network. Now it is undefined which creates uncertainty.",

In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree shall provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within seven (7) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for DeltaThree to provide written notice detailing the reasons for any disputed amounts in the report creates uncertainty. DeltaThree can now dispute amounts without providing any justification or explanation. Section 5.01 states payment must be calculated based on these reports; thus, this affects enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the explicit conditions under which PrimeCall may assign this agreement without DeltaThree's consent (affiliate, merger, consolidation, or sale of business) creates ambiguity. It contradicts the later statement requiring DeltaThree's consent for any assignment by PrimeCall, because it's now unclear if there are *any* exceptions to that requirement.

                "explanation": "This change modifies the definition of 'Threshold Block' to five percent (5%) ownership. This creates a contradiction if Article VII refers to the original one percent (1%) threshold, making enforcement ambiguous regarding rights triggered by ownership of a 'Threshold Block'.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the joinder agreement clause means that 'Permitted Transfers' no longer necessarily require the transferee to agree to the terms of the agreement. However, other sections may rely on transferees adhering to the original agreement, creating enforcement contradictions.",

The Company shall not file any Eligible Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto in respect of which the Farids Group has a right to review prior to the filing of such document, if the Farids Group, its counsel or the managing underwriter, if any, shall reasonably object, in writing, on a timely basis.",

                "explanation": "By modifying 'shall afford' to 'may, at its sole discretion, afford', the obligation for the company to allow Farids Group to review registration statements is removed. If other sections still imply Farids Group has this review right, this creates a direct contradiction, making enforcement uncertain.",

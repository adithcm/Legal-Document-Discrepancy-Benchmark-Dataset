                "original_text": "\"Applicable Specifications\" means the functional, performance, operational, compatibility, and other specifications or characteristics of the LMG Tools, CSC Software and Other Third Party Software described in the applicable Documentation or necessary for TAG to provide the TPA Services to the New Customers and perform its obligations under the New Customer Contracts.",
                "changed_text": "\"Applicable Specifications\" means specifications deemed appropriate by LMG.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'Applicable Specifications' to be solely determined by LMG, it contradicts other sections of the agreement that assume the specifications are related to functionality, performance and customer contracts. This creates uncertainty as to what specifications LMG is obligated to meet and makes the enforcement ambiguous as it relies on LMG's subjective assessment rather than an objective standard.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement that LMG provide all upgrades developed and replacing it with 'at their discretion' creates a contradiction. Earlier sections may imply TAG's reliance on continuous updates for the TPA Services, and this change allows LMG to withhold crucial improvements, impacting TAG's ability to serve New Customers adequately. It makes enforcement uncertain because the term 'discretion' is open to interpretation.",

The plans will be made available to TAG for review upon TAG's request. LMG agrees that it will (a) test the plans at least once every calendar year during the Term hereof, and certify to TAG that such plans are fully operational, and (b) consult with TAG regarding the priority to be given to the LMG Services during any such disaster.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirements for a business continuity plan, necessary resources, capabilities, testing and certification and consulting with TAG about disaster priorities. It introduces an ambiguity in LMG's obligations. Now, the contract only specifies a 'disaster recovery plan' but omits the necessary details. This creates an inconsistency as TAG still relies on LMG services, but there are no longer comprehensive disaster safeguards.",

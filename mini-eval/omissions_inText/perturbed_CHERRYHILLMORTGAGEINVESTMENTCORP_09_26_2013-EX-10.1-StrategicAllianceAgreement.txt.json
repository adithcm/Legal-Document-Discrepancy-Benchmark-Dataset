                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'Acknowledgement Agreement' but still referencing it in Section 2, the contract now contains a reference to a term that is not defined within the agreement itself, creating ambiguity and potentially hindering enforcement related to Ginnie Mae requirements. If there is any dispute about the Purchase Agreement it will be hard to interpret since the definition is now missing.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific threshold of '$40,000,000 plus', for Freedom Mortgage's Tangible Net Worth the contract causes ambiguity in determining when a Standby Trigger Event has occurred. Section 2(b) refers to Standby Trigger Event, and it will be hard to determine the trigger if the worth is not defined. This omission creates uncertainty and contradiction, particularly when calculating the Trigger Event.",

                "explanation": "By removing '(as defined in the Acknowledgement Agreement)' but still requiring Freedom Mortgage to designate a Standby Issuer that will be accepted by Ginnie Mae, the text introduces a degree of circularity and ambiguity. This is because without the reference of the Standby Issuer, the obligations and criteria will be ambiguous. Section 2 references the Acknowledgement Agreement and becomes hard to enforce since this has had its definition perturbed.",

                "original_text": "NAI will pay any resulting costs, damages and attorneys' fees finally awarded by a court, or agreed to in settlement by NAI, with respect to any such claims to the extent of the compensation received under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "NAI will pay any resulting costs, damages and attorneys' fees finally awarded by a court, or agreed to in settlement by NAI, with respect to any such claims.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"to the extent of the compensation received under this Agreement\", the changed text implies that NAI's liability is unlimited, which contradicts the Limitation of Liability clause in Section 10 that caps direct damages at fifteen million dollars. This creates an inconsistency regarding the maximum amount NAI is liable for in case of claims.",

                "changed_text": "Late payments shall incur penalties.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific interest rate and replacing it with 'penalties,' the modified text contradicts the 'Payment Terms' in the previous section. Without specifying the penalty amount, it is unclear how late payments will be handled, creating uncertainty in enforcement. Section 3(b) still mentions the penalty, but the exact amount is missing.",

If neither of the foregoing alternatives is available on terms that NAI deems reasonable, Co-Host will return such Products on written request from NAI. NAI will grant Co-Host a credit equal to the price paid by Co-Host for such returned Products, as adjusted for discounts, returns and credits actually given, provided that such returned Products are in an undamaged condition.",
                "changed_text": "Co-Host agrees that, if the Products in the inventory of Co-Host, or the operation thereof, become, or in NAI's opinion are likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Co-Host will permit NAI, at NAI's option and expense, to, among other things, procure the right for Co-Host to continue marketing and using such Products, or to replace or modify them so that they become non-infringing.",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes the obligation of NAI to grant Co-Host a credit for returned infringing products. This creates a contradiction because Co-Host is still obligated to return infringing products, but is no longer guaranteed compensation for doing so. This inconsistency creates uncertainty about the financial repercussions of returning products due to infringement claims.",

Other sections of the agreement still reference and depend on the Cooperation Period for determining the duration of certain obligations. The omission makes it unclear how long these obligations are meant to last, causing uncertainty in the enforcement of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The clauses specifying \"in Section 7 in any material respect, and shall not have remedied such failure or non-fulfillment if capable of being remedied or fulfilled within three (3) business days following written notice from the Company of such failure or non-fulfillment\" have been removed. This creates an ambiguity because any failure by JANA, regardless of its materiality or ability to be remedied, now triggers the consequences outlined in this section. This contradicts the initial intent, where only material, un-remedied breaches lead to these severe actions. Furthermore, section 7 outlines cooperation terms during an undefined Cooperation Period, adding uncertainty to these terms.",

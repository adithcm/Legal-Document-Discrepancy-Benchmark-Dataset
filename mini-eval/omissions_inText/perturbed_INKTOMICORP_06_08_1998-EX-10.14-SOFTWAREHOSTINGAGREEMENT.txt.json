                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to 'Exhibit A' and the formal amendment process, the definition of 'Deployment, Hosting and Maintenance Specifications' becomes vague and unenforceable. This omission creates an in-text contradiction because later sections of the contract still refer to these 'Specifications' as if they have a defined, mutually agreed-upon content, when in fact their meaning is now ambiguous.",

Such employees are identified in Exhibit D attached hereto; and their replacements shall be subject to Microsoft's prior written approval (which approval Microsoft will not unreasonably withhold). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Microsoft and Inktomi mutually agree in writing, additional Inktomi employees may be required to be assigned to maintenance duties hereunder.",

                "explanation": "By removing the mention of Exhibit D and the requirement for Microsoft's approval for replacements, the clause becomes significantly weaker. This creates a contradiction with other sections that might rely on dedicated and qualified staff, as the contract now lacks a specific commitment to two full-time employees, and gives Inktomi the unilateral right to appoint or reappoint staff.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of Exodus Communications, the commitment to a specific facility and the required Microsoft approval, the hosting arrangements become more ambiguous. Furthermore, the removal of the obligation to provide Exodus with the Security Measures creates an internal inconsistency, because previous sections still talk about the 'Security Measures' but the contract no longer ensures that the hosting provider is bound to them.",

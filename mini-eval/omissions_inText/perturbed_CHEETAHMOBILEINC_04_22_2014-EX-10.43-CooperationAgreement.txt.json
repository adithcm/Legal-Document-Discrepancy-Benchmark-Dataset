The search traffic generated by Party A for Party B, which forms the basis for calculating the actual revenues, shall be determined by Party B based on its statistical data.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause that 'actual revenues' are 'less Party B's related costs and legal taxes and charges' and that the traffic is 'determined by Party B based on its statistical data,' creates ambiguity in how the actual revenues are calculated. Section 5.2.2 references 'Actual Revenues,' but without a clear definition, it's open to interpretation and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "Removing the condition that \"Cheetah Browser\" will list Party B's search engine service as the default search engine service weakens Party B's guarantee of prominent placement, and introduces uncertainty regarding the actual cooperation. This contradiction arises since Annex 2 and other clauses rely on search engine box",

                "explanation": "By removing 'require Party B to pay 30% of Party A's share of revenues as liquidated damages', Party A has no immediate penalty if Party B publishes unauthorized content. While Party A can terminate the agreement, the removal of damages makes that termination less desirable than it was previously. Without the liquidated damages clause, section 8.1 is now the only route to take against breach of contract; this undermines the purpose of the original section and creates an internal contradiction.",

Schwarzman, on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",

                "explanation": "By removing the initial clause referencing the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 13, the contract omits its legal basis, weakening enforceability and creating potential ambiguity. It now lacks a clear statement of compliance with the Exchange Act, which it originally claimed. Without the specific reference, it's unclear if all necessary filings are intended to be covered. This omission introduces uncertainty regarding the scope of the filing obligations.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and any amendments thereto' clause the contract introduces ambiguity and could lead to disputes. Without the explicit mention of 'amendments', a party could argue they are not responsible for the timely filing of amendments, even though they are responsible for the 'timely filing of such filings'. This omission weakens the agreement, creating a loophole and uncertainty in legal obligations.",

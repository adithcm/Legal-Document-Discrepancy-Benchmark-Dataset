The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases like \"meanings that the parties find mutually agreeable from time to time\" and \"some of the Patents,\" which creates uncertainty about which specific items are covered.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the seller transfers ALL rights and interest in the Assigned IP to the purchaser.

This introduces an internal contradiction because other sections will assume a full transfer of rights, while this section now limits it.",

Each such item of Registered Intellectual Property is subsisting and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, valid and enforceable (except with respect to applications for Intellectual Property).

                "explanation": "The original text asserts ownership and marketable title definitively, with schedules providing complete and accurate lists. The modified text weakens these assertions using qualifiers like \"believed to be owned,\" \"some Intellectual Property,\" and removes the guarantee of \"complete and accurate list\". It introduces uncertainty about the extent of ownership and the scope of what's listed in the schedules. This contradiction is significant because Article II relies on a clear and accurate definition of the IP being transferred and licensed.",

(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\") and A.B. Watley, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"ABW\"), who are also the parties contracted in the aforementioned Co-Branding Agreement. This Amendment shall apply to said PCQ and ABW and all of their subsidiaries and related companies.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to \"Section 2 (titled 'Term')\" creates uncertainty. If another part of the original agreement or a future amendment references Section 2's term without explicitly defining it, it's now unclear what 'Term' refers to, creating a contradiction if later interpretations conflict with the original intent or references to a term in a section that no longer exists.",

                "explanation": "Removing the names and titles (Mr. Steven Malin, Mr. Howard Meltzer, Director, President) creates an inconsistency. If other sections rely on these official titles to determine authority or responsibility, removing them makes it unclear who officially agreed to the amendment on behalf of each company. This could create contradictions or ambiguities if the signatures are later challenged or if authority is disputed.",

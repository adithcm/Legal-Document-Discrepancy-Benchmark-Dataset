                "explanation": "The removal of specific examples of what constitutes 'Advertising Services' creates ambiguity. Later sections referring to specific advertising services (Digital Content Service, Digital Carousel etc.) are now unclear as their relationship to the broader definition is now undefined. This introduces uncertainty in how 'Advertising Revenue Share' is calculated if the scope of 'Advertising Services' is unclear.",

The policy trailer will be (i) up to 60 seconds, (ii) exhibited in the Theatres after Showtime, (iii) be customized to include the name of the Network Affiliates Theatre business and (iii) used to feature content relating to Theatre policy and operations, and may include (w) a policy service announcement that promotes appropriate theatre behavior, (x) promotions of Network Affiliate Concessions, (y) upon prior written approval of Network Affiliate, other promotional materials of third-party products for which NCM sells advertising and is paid a fee (the \"Policy Trailer\").

                "explanation": "By removing specific details about the 'Policy Trailer' length, exhibition time, and customization options, the modified text contradicts the original intent. If later clauses reference these specific characteristics, they become unenforceable or ambiguous. For example, if revenue sharing depends on 'Policy Trailer' advertising revenue, its length becomes crucial but undefined, leading to a conflict.",

Subsequent sections that rely on this amount for calculating minimum fees or revenue sharing will create an internal contradiction because the key monetary value is missing, making enforcement of financial obligations uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By removing the deductions from gross receipts, the definition of 'Net Revenue' becomes unclear, especially concerning what costs can be subtracted before commission calculations. This contradicts Exhibit B which bases reseller compensation on 'Net Revenue'. Without defined deductions, commission payments become ambiguously enforceable.",

This contradicts standard legal principles and could create uncertainty about whether the reseller is responsible for damages caused by their intentional or reckless actions related to the company products. This could conflict with Section 8 regarding Indemnification by the reseller.",

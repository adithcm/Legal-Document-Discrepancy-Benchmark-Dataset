                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the payment deadline from 30 days to 60 days. This creates uncertainty about which deadline should be enforced, potentially leading to disputes over late payment penalties.",

Full payment of the purchase price for Products (other than Systems), Spare  Parts and upgrades shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars by wire transfer to a bank selected by Accuray  and is due net 45 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by  Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice. Accuray shall bear the cost of any commission charge for a wire transfer.",
                "explanation": "This changes the payment terms for products, spare parts and upgrades to 'net 45 days' after delivery and invoice receipt, which contradicts the 'net 30 days' mentioned earlier in Section 5.4.1.2.2, and creates ambiguity.",

This directly conflicts with the originally stated interest rate, thus creating an in-text contradiction. This would create uncertainty about which interest rate to apply to late payments.",

This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual\n\nconsent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the adjustment of advertising fees. The original text requires mutual consent for revising the formula, while the modified text allows 2TheMart to unilaterally adjust the rate. This creates uncertainty about how the advertising fees can be changed.",

Initially, audits could occur once every twelve months, but now it's every six. Payment timeframe changes from two weeks to two months, and the overdue payment threshold from 10% to 5%.

                "explanation": "The modified text introduces conflicting terms regarding payment deadlines and the survival of agreement provisions after termination. Previously, i-Escrow had six weeks to pay all outstanding amounts. This is now reduced to 30 days. Moreover, all provisions were to survive unless there was a material breach; this is changed so that all provisions are upheld even if there was a material breach. The survival of sections is also inverted, causing contradiction. This introduces ambiguities concerning what happens upon termination.",

                "changed_text": "8. Term of Joint Venture. The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination. However, either Joint Venturer may unilaterally terminate the agreement with written notice of sixty (60) days.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Section 8 initially states the term ends on February 28, 2004 unless extended by mutual agreement. The added sentence allows unilateral termination by either party with 60 days' notice, regardless of the initial term or extension agreement. This creates uncertainty about when and how the Joint Venture can be terminated and conflicts with the extension clause.",

No Joint Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided, however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.",
                "explanation": "This creates a conflict because while the original section dictates distributions are based on pro-rata interest and only if assets exceed liabilities, the added sentence provides PVSS with a guaranteed monthly payment irrespective of the Joint Venture's financial status. This contradicts the pro-rata distribution rule and introduces ambiguity about distribution priority, potentially leading to disputes.",

On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.",

However, in the event of a dispute regarding the valuation of assets during liquidation, Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. will have the final say on the asset's value.",
                "explanation": "This amendment introduces a conflict regarding asset valuation during liquidation. While the original text stipulates that Parties must agree on a price for assets not easily divided, the new addition gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. unilateral authority in case of a valuation dispute. This contradicts the initial agreement to mutual consent on asset value and raises concerns about whether both parties receive their fair share of Joint Venture assets.",

                "changed_text": "Provider shall maintain records relating to the provision of the Services under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'in such form as Recipient shall approve', it creates ambiguity regarding the required format and detail of the records. While Provider is still obligated to maintain records, Recipient's ability to enforce a specific standard or level of detail is weakened, potentially leading to disputes and difficulty in verifying the Services.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states Provider *irrevocably assigns* all rights. The omission of \"irrevocably assigns\" and other key phrases introduces ambiguity as to whether the Recipient automatically owns all rights or if there are conditions to the transfer. It also removes explicit ownership of rights on a 'worldwide basis'. This contradiction weakens Recipient's claim of ownership.",

In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
                "changed_text": "As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount for providing the Services. In addition to such amount, Recipient shall reimburse Provider for out-of-pocket expenses.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the payment terms ('actual cost plus 10% service fee') and specifies the conditions and types of out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursable ('reasonable and documented'). By removing these specific details, the modified text creates uncertainty about how the 'amount for providing services' is determined and what constitutes reimbursable 'out-of-pocket expenses'. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes regarding invoice amounts and what expenses are covered, contradicting any implied agreement on payment structure.",

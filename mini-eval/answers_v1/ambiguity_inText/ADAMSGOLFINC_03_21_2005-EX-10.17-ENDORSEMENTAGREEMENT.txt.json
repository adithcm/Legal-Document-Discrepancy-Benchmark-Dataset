                "original_text": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image in connection with the marketing, advertising, promotion and sale of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT.",
                "changed_text": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image solely in print advertising campaigns for ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. This excludes any personal appearances or television commercials.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict with section 11, which discusses promotional appearances. The original definition broadly covers all marketing, but this revised definition limits it to print, potentially creating disputes about the scope of the endorsement and whether appearances are covered.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever practical. The decision on whether to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT in a specific tournament will be at the sole discretion of the CONSULTANT based on performance considerations. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the 'exclusive use' clause. Initially, CONSULTANT *had* to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. Now, it's 'whenever practical' at his discretion. This creates conflict with paragraph 8, which penalizes CONSULTANT for not playing in a minimum number of tournaments with ADAMS GOLF equipment.",

However, ADAMS GOLF will cover CONSULTANT's attorney fees up to $10,000.",
                "explanation": "This creates ambiguity regarding who covers attorney fees and to which amount. The original text indicates CONSULTANT covers 'any and all expenses,' including attorney fees. The change excludes attorney fees but then says ADAMS GOLF will cover some amount, which goes against what it means to 'indemnify'.",

                "explanation": "The change in section 8B, extending the payment deadline from one month to three months following the end of the calendar year, introduces an in-text contradiction. This contradicts the original payment deadline of one month, creating ambiguity about when the repayment is actually due. This could lead to disputes over late payment penalties or accusations of breach of contract.",

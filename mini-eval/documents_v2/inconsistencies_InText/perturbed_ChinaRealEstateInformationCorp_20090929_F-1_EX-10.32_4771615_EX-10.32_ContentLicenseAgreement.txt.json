                "original_text": "For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") with respect to the Source: CHINA REAL ESTATE INFORMATION CORP, F-1, 9/29/2009 relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the possession, directly or indirectly or as trustee, personal representative or executor, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the affairs or management of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, as trustee, personal representative or executor, by contract, credit arrangement or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") with respect to the relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the ability to influence, directly or indirectly, the affairs or management of a Person, whether through ownership, contractual agreements, familial relationship, or any other means. This definition shall be interpreted broadly to encompass any form of influence, regardless of the percentage of ownership or the formality of the arrangement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the definition of \"control.\" Originally, control was defined as the power to direct affairs through ownership of voting securities, trusteeship, contract, or credit arrangement. The change broadens this to 'ability to influence' through any means, including familial relationships, and states it should be interpreted broadly, moving away from the original, more specific criteria. This contradicts the original definition, which relies on more concrete and measurable elements like ownership of voting securities or formal agreements. This broadens the scope of 'control' which creates uncertainty in various parts of the agreement that rely on the original definition.",

For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") with respect to the relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the ability to influence, directly or indirectly, the affairs or management of a Person, whether through ownership, contractual agreements, familial relationship, or any other means. This definition shall be interpreted broadly to encompass any form of influence, regardless of the percentage of ownership or the formality of the arrangement. \"Agency Agreement\" means that certain Advertising Sale Agency Agreement by and between SINA Corporation and China Online Housing Technology Corporation, dated as of the date hereof. \"Business\" means an online real estate media platform in the PRC that (i) provides information and updates related to real estate, home furnishing and construction in the PRC and provides real estate, home furnishing and construction advertising services, and (ii) operates a business-to- business and business-to-consumer Internet platform targeting participants in the PRC real estate industry, in each case, as currently conducted or contemplated to be conducted on the websites owned or operated by Licensee or any of Licensee's Affiliates in the PRC."

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by removing the requirement for Licensor to communicate changes to the content distribution policy in writing in advance and allowing Licensor to unilaterally establish policies without agreement from Licensee. This contradicts the original clause that ensures Licensee is afforded the same period of time to implement any new content distribution policy as Licensor's Affiliates and other third parties, as the change does not consider the potential impact on Licensee's operations. The insertion is conflicting in the sense it alters power dynamics in how policies are implemented.",

This in-text contradicts the initial clause granting a transition period upon termination for any reason, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over the actual transition timeframe. As the previous clause stated the transition period shall be 90 days, this new clause introduces uncertainty regarding what is to be followed, 90 or 30 days.",

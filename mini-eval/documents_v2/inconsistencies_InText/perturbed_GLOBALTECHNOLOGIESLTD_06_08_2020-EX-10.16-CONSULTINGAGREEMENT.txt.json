                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for one (1) year or until Consultant completes the services requested.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for six (6) months or until Consultant completes the services requested.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'one (1) year' to 'six (6) months' creates an in-text contradiction with Section 5, which implies ongoing compensation and services for a potentially longer period related to inventory/asset sales from the TCBM Holdings, LLC acquisition, without specifying any end date based on the initial term of the agreement. This introduces uncertainty regarding the duration of Consultant's responsibilities and compensation related to the TCBM Holdings, LLC acquisition beyond the initial six month.",

                "contradicted_text": "As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition. The Consultant will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the Consultant's performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. The Company will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf. The Consultant agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this Agreement. The Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest."

                "explanation": "Changing 'without notice' to 'with 30 days notice' contradicts the later part of Section 2 which states: 'Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be the date such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party.' Now it's not clear how much notification is needed, as well as creating an in-text contradiction between the cases of termination without and with notice, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over what constitutes proper termination procedure in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors.",

Consultant shall devote such time and efforts to the affairs of the Company as is reasonably necessary to render the services contemplated by this Agreement. Consultant is not responsible for the performance of any services that may be rendered hereunder if the Company fails to provide the requested information in writing prior thereto. The services of Consultant shall include the rendering of legal opinions and the performance of any work that is in the ordinary purview of a certified public accountant. Consultant cannot guarantee results on behalf of the Company but shall use commercially reasonable efforts in providing the services listed above. Consultant's duty is to identify prospective acquisition/joint venture companies for the Company. Consultant will in no way act as a \"broker-dealer\" under state securities laws. Because all final decisions pertaining to any particular investment are to be made by the Company, the Company may be required to communicate directly with potential acquisition/joint venture prospective companies."

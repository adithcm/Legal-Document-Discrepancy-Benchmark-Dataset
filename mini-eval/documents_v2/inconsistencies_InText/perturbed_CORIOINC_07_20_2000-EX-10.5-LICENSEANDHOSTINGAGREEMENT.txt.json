                "explanation": "The modified text introduces an in-text contradiction by changing terms for accounting practices. Corio's books and records are to be kept for one year instead of three, the inspections are to be acceptable by commerce one and not corio, inspections can be made twice each year and at any time without reasonable notice, the expenses of inspection are shared, and in case of underpayment they enter a negotiation phase instead of paying, and that the underpayment should be more than 1%. It is creating an in-text contradiction because the original audit rights state that Corio is responsible for paying and maintaining records for 3 years, meaning this perturbation affects the original terms, because how can Corio be audited when commerce one approves the audit inspections? Additionally, it is not clear on when will the negotiation phase end for settling in case of underpayment.",

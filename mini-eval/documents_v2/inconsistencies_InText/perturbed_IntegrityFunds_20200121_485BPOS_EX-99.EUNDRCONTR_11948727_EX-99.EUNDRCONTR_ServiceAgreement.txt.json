The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by specifying a payment timeframe of 'within 15 days of invoice' in Section 1.7, while the original text defers to the 'manner and terms set forth in the Plan.' If the Plan outlines a different payment schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or upon certain milestones), Section 1.7 now creates a direct conflict, resulting in uncertainty regarding payment deadlines. This contradicts with section 2.3, where it sets that 'The Fund shall pay to Integrity, as set forth in the Registration Statement, any distribution and service fee authorized by the Plan.'",

This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days' written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity.

                "explanation": "The modification changes the termination notice period required from the Fund's Qualified Trustees from '60 days' to '30 days'. This alteration creates an in-text contradiction within Section 7.1 itself, because there are now two different periods of time, for termination, if The Fund's is going to terminate the agreement. This causes an In-Text Contradiction, because it generates a contradiction, because of 2 different termination periodes for a termination from the Fund's, generating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By removing the word 'not' from 'shall not include any expenditures', the modified Section 1.8 now states that distribution expenses *include* expenditures that Integrity has agreed to bear without reimbursement. This contradicts the original intention of the clause, which was to exclude such expenses from the definition of 'distribution expenses' that Integrity is responsible for. The original text intended to prevent Integrity from being reimbursed for costs it voluntarily agreed to cover. The modified text implies the opposite: that Integrity *can* be reimbursed for these expenses, thus conflicting with previous sections where it stated that Integrity bears the cost. The specific contradiction is the reversal of who bears the cost for expenses Integrity agreed to.",

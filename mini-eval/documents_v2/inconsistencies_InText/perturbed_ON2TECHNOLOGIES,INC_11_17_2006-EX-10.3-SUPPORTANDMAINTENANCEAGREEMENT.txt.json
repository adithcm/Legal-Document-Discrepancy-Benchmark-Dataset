                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline for the first monthly payment. Initially, it's due 30 days from the Effective Date. The change extends this to 45 days, contradicting the clause stating \"each subsequent payment payable within thirty (30) days of the preceding payment\". This could lead to disputes regarding when the first payment is due and when subsequent payments should start.",

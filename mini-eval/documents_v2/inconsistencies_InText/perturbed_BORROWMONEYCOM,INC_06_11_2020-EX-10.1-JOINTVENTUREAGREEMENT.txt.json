This contradicts the original text, which implies the payment is derived from monthly government contracts without any fixed deadline. This creates uncertainty about when the payment is actually due, as the generated revenue from awarded contract would vary, contradicting the set day frame.",

                "explanation": "The change alters the valuation method of the Venture, replacing the fair market value appraisal of assets with the total revenue generated over the last 3 months. This contradicts the sentence that states: 'In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Venture will be determined based on the fair market value appraisal of all Venture assets (less liabilities) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members.' This introduces ambiguity, as both valuation methods are presented, and the section now lacks the previous detail of being determined in accordance to GAAP by an independent accounting firm, which contradicts the binding nature of the results to all members.",

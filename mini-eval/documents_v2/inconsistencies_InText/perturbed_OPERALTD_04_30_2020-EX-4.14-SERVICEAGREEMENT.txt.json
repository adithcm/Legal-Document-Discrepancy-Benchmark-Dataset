                "changed_text": "4.1 PC Financial shall pay a monthly Fee to Mobimagic in accordance with this Agreement, but the timeline for payment can be extended beyond what is permitted under the prevailing India regulations, subject to mutual agreement documented via email.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that the payment timeline can be extended beyond the limits of Indian regulations, conflicting with the original text which mandates adherence to those regulations. This creates uncertainty about which payment terms are actually enforceable and opens the door for potential disputes.",

PC Financial will promptly inform Mobimagic in writing of any such Action and will co-operate in the defence and/or settlement of the Action. Mobimagic agrees that in negotiating any settlement, it shall act reasonably and shall obtain PC Financial's prior, written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.",

PC Financial will promptly inform Mobimagic in writing of any such Action and will co-operate in the defence and/or settlement of the Action. Mobimagic agrees that in negotiating any settlement, it shall have sole discretion and is not required to obtain PC Financial's prior consent.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces an in-text contradiction by limiting Mobimagic's indemnification obligations, stating that it specifically excludes liability for indirect/consequential damages unless gross negligence is proven. This contradicts the initial statement that Mobimagic shall indemnify against \"any cost, penalty, loss or damage\". It also contradicts and creates an in-text contradiction with the original consent required, which now states that Mobimagic has sole discretion and isn't required to obtain PC Financial's consent. This creates uncertainty about the extent of Mobimagic's indemnification responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the governing law from the laws of India to the laws of the People's Republic of China. It also changes the exclusive jurisdiction from the courts of New Delhi to the courts of Beijing. This creates uncertainty about which legal system governs the agreement.

                "explanation": "The modification to the definition of \"Interim Period\" from four (4) years to two (2) years creates an in-text contradiction. Several clauses, such as 2.2.1, 2.3.1, 2.5.1 and 2.8.1, rely on the original definition of the Interim Period being four years. By changing the definition, these sections now contradict the newly defined 'Interim Period' of two years, causing confusion about the duration of the licenses and usage rights granted to HERC. Particularly, the termination of rights after the interim period as described in those sections are now contradicting because of the time gap.",

                "explanation": "The modification to section 2.5.1, which grants HERC the right to retain ownership and use of the HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks 'in perpetuity,' directly contradicts the stipulation that HERC shall discontinue use of these trademarks upon the expiration of the 'Interim Period', and contradicts the previously defined 'Interim Period'. This creates a significant in-text contradiction about the duration of HERC's rights to use the trademarks and enforce the coexistence agreement. The perpetuity clause undermines the temporal limits set by the rest of the agreement.",

If HERC's breach involves an issue with the insurance policy, the reduced cure period may not allow sufficient time for HERC to rectify the insurance issue if the ten-day window is required for both the cure and to notify THC and HSI, creating uncertainty about the enforcement of the termination clause and the remedies available to THC/HSI. The cure period does not overlap with the time to notify, creating an in-text contradiction regarding compliance and a limited timeframe.",

Such policy shall provide, in addition to other protection, protection against any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any act, omission, negligence or otherwise giving rise to a third party claim. The amount of coverage shall be a minimum of three million dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit, with no deductible amount for each single occurrence for bodily injury and/or property damage. HERC shall provide for ten (10) days notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination.

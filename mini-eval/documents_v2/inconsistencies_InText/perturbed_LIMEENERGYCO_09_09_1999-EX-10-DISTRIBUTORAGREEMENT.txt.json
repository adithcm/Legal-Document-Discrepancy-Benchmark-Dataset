                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by initially stating that the Distributor shall pay the Company within 60 days of receipt of products, but then creating an exception specifying a payment term of 90 days for the first year. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding which payment deadline should be enforced during the initial year of the contract, therefore, creating an in-text contradiction on the payment terms.",

This contradicts the initial term that set forth on the same terms and conditions of the original agreement, therefore, creating an in-text contradiction on the terms of the contract",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing who the beneficiary of the product liability insurance is and changing how much notice the Distributor would get. Initially, the distributor was a beneficiary, now they are not. The second contradiction, refers to the advance notice period. The original time frame was 30 days now it is 15 days. This creates an in-text contradiction because the contract now becomes ambigious.",

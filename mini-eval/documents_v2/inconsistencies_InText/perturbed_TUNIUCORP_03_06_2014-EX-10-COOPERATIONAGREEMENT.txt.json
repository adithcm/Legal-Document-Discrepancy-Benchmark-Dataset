                "original_text": "4.2 The Service Fee of the last quarter shall be paid prior to the seventh business day following the commencement of the next quarter. Such Service Fee shall be paid to the bank account designated by Party B in writing. If Party B intends to change its bank account, it shall send a written notice to Party A seven business days in advance.",

However, if Party A notifies Party B that they are experiencing financial difficulty, Party A can delay payments up to 60 days. Such Service Fee shall be paid to the bank account designated by Party B in writing. If Party B intends to change its bank account, it shall send a written notice to Party A seven business days in advance.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by adding a clause allowing Party A to delay service fee payments by up to 60 days if they claim financial difficulty. This contradicts the original clause which stipulates that payment must be made within seven business days following the commencement of the next quarter. This creates uncertainty about the payment deadline and enforcement, specifically in Article 4.3.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by adding a new condition, 6.1.4, stating that Party A can terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice.

This directly contradicts the first sentence of the original Article 12.2, which states that neither Party's rights and obligations shall be transferred, except for Party B transferring to affiliates.

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the timeframe for opening a letter of credit from 30 days to 60 days. This contradicts the later clause that states the Letter of Credit shall be valid until 90 days after the latest shipment, potentially creating situations where the credit is not valid for the originally intended period and causes uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By extending the claim period from 7 days to 30 days in Section 16, this modification creates an in-text contradiction with the penalty clause in Section 18. This is because the late delivery penalty is calculated based on a 7-day interval (0.5% for every seven days), now the buyer has 30 days to claim for the goods, making the penalty clause not in relation to how much time the buyers are allowed to make any claims.",

The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty"

                "explanation": "By reducing the contract validity from 5 to 3 years and changing the governing language in case of conflict from Chinese to English, an in-text contradiction is created.

The term of agreement is invalidating older purchase orders, which signed to 5 years but only valid for 3 and it cause dispute.",

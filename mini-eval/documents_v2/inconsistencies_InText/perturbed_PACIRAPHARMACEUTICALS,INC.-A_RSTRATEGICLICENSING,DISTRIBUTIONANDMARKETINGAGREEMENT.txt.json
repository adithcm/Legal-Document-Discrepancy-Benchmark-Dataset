                "explanation": "The change in the definition of 'Affiliate' from entities under 'Control' to those 'loosely associated' creates contradiction. The original definition implies a specific degree of control or ownership, typically requiring a certain percentage of ownership or influence. The modified definition includes entities with weak associations such as familial connections. This in-text contradiction impacts sections relying on a clear definition of Affiliate, such as those governing liability, indemnification, and confidentiality obligations, by creating uncertainty about which entities fall under these contractual obligations and what that entails.",

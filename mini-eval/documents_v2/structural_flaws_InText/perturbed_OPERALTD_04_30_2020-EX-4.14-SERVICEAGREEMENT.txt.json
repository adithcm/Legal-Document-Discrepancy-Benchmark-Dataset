                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Service Period' provides a fixed duration. By adding 'unless earlier terminated as per section 9, or as unilaterally extended by PC Financial upon written notice to Mobimagic,' we create a contradiction. Section 9 deals with termination, but this addition allows PC Financial to unilaterally extend the agreement, conflicting with the initial fixed duration and the mutual agreement needed for renewal in 9.1. This creates uncertainty about the actual Service Period and gives PC Financial more power to extend the terms. This also creates a contradictory situation, because Section 9.1 states \"The Agreement may be extended or renewed by the Parties in a writing executed by authorized representatives of each of the Parties.\"",

                "explanation": "The original text states Mobimagic warrants the services will not infringe on legal rights or violate laws, creating a firm commitment. The inserted phrase '; however, PC Financial acknowledges that Mobimagic cannot guarantee complete accuracy or reliability and is not responsible for any inaccuracies' immediately undermines this warranty, essentially stating that while Mobimagic warrants quality and legality, it is not liable if those standards are not met. This creates an in-text contradiction because it negates the impact and assurance of the original warranty. The warranty implies a guarantee of no infringements, whereas the additional clause states that they are not responsible if there are inaccuracies that might result in infringements. This can create dispute between the parties because Mobimagic could claim not to be responsible for legal infringements since 'accuracy' and 'reliability' can't be granted.",

                "explanation": "Section 7 originally contains a strict prohibition on disclosing Confidential Information. The added phrase 'unless required to do so by law or regulation, or at the discretion of the disclosing party' creates a contradiction. While the first exception (law or regulation) is standard, the second ('at the discretion of the disclosing party') allows a party to unilaterally decide to disclose the other party's Confidential Information, negating the purpose of the confidentiality clause. While seemingly permitting flexibility, this addition effectively renders the entire confidentiality section unenforceable, creating uncertainty. This is an in-text contradiction because the section begins with a clear prohibition on disclosure but then grants an unrestricted right to do so at will. The confidentiality clause is contradicted, as any confidential information can be shared if the disclosing party wishes to share it.",

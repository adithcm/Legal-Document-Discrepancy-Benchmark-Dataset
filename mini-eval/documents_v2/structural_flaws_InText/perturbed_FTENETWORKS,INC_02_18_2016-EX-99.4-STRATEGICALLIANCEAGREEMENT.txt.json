                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding subcontracting. Originally, Subcontractor could subcontract without EDGE's consent. The modified text now requires EDGE's prior written notification and consent. This contradicts Section 30(A), which states, 'All provisions on Subcontractor's forms shall be deemed deleted. Additional or different terms inserted in this Agreement by Subcontractor, or deletions thereto, whether by alterations, addenda, or otherwise, shall be of no force and effect, unless expressly consented to by EDGE in writing.' This highlights the conflict because the original agreement allowed subcontracting freely, but the changed text and Section 30(A) makes the validity and process of subcontracting unclear.",

Additional or different terms inserted in this Agreement by Subcontractor, or deletions thereto, whether by alterations, addenda, or otherwise, shall be of no force and effect, unless expressly consented to by EDGE in writing.

                "explanation": "The original agreement clearly states that EDGE's payment to the Subcontractor is independent of Customer's payment to EDGE. The modified text reverses this, making EDGE's payment contingent on Customer's approval and payment. This introduces a Pay-When-Paid clause, which directly contradicts the previous statement and creates uncertainty about when the Subcontractor will get paid. It also directly contradicts the meaning of the original statment, since the 'not' was omitted from the original statment.",

                "changed_text": "After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall continue on a month to month basis and will be considered perpetual, unless terminated by both parties upon mutual written agreement, overriding any individual termination clauses.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows either party to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice after the initial term. The modified clause states that the agreement is considered perpetual unless both parties mutually agree to terminate, effectively overriding the original termination clause. This creates a direct contradiction, as the agreement can now only be terminated by mutual consent rather than unilateral action, making the requirements for termination inconsistent and creating uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement can be dissolved. This statement directly contradicts the previous statement, thus causing a change that can be argued in court.",

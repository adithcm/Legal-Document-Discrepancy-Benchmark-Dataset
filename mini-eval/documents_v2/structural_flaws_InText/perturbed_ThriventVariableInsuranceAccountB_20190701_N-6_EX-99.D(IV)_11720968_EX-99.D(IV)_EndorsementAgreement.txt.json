If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

The modified text adds 'However, the Society reserves the right to waive this indebtedness at its sole discretion.' This creates an in-text contradiction because the original states it will be charged, which implies a requirement, while the addendum provides an escape clause that creates uncertainty if the indebtedness is actually charged or not.",

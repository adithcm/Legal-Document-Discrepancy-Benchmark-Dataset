                "original_text": "The phrase \"Purchase Schedule\" will mean a written supplement to this Agreement signed by an officer of each Party which references this Agreement and which identities, among other terms and conditions, the specific types and quantities of products that will be purchased and sold by the Parties on terms and conditions in the schedule, the specifications for the identified products, the duration of the commitment period during which the Parties will be obligated to purchase and sell the identified products on the terms and conditions in the schedule, the prices of the identified products, any mechanisms for adjusting the prices of the identified products over the commitment period, and the facilities at which the identified products will be manufactured, stored and delivered by Seller.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the requirement for a Purchase Schedule to be 'written' and 'signed by an officer of each party' creates an in-text contradiction with Section 12(a) and 12(b), which specify that amendments and the entire agreement itself must be in writing and signed by the chief executive officers of each party. This creates uncertainty about the validity and enforceability of purchase schedules and opens the door to disputes over whether unsigned or verbally agreed-upon schedules are binding.",

This Agreement, including its appended Exhibits and Purchase Schedules entered into during the Term, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the sale of products by Seller to Buyer and the purchase of products by Buyer from Seller. This Agreement supersedes all prior and simultaneous representations, discussions, negotiations, letters, proposals, agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to this subject matter. This Agreement will not be binding on either Party unless and until signed by the chief executive officers of each Party. No handwritten or other addition, deletion or other modification to the printed portions of this Agreement will be binding upon either Party to this Agreement."

                "explanation": "By removing the clause that states the parties must attempt negotiation or mediation before suspension or termination, I am creating an in-text contradiction between Subsection 11(a) and 11(b) which mandates negotiation and mediation before litigation, and the modified Subsection 11(d), which now allows termination without these steps. This creates uncertainty and potentially encourages premature termination or suspension of performance, circumventing the intended dispute resolution process.",

If a Party believes that the other Party has breached this Agreement or if there is a dispute between the Parties over the interpretation of this Agreement (a \"Dispute\"), the Parties will endeavor to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiation for a period of thirty (30) days after a Party notifies the other Party of the Dispute and before either Party requests mediation or files litigation to resolve the Dispute. b. Mediation. If the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute through good faith negotiation as provided in the prior Subsection, a Party may request that the Parties attempt to resolve the Dispute through mediation by notifying the other Party with a copy to JAMS. The Parties will attempt to select a mutually acceptable JAMS mediator within ten (10) days of the notice requesting mediation. The mediation will be held in Lake County or Cook County, Illinois within thirty (30) days of the notice requesting mediation before a JAMS mediator and in compliance with JAMS mediation guidelines. Each party will bear its own costs in preparing for and participating in the mediation and one-half of the fees and expenses charged by JAMS for conducting the mediation."

                "explanation": "By omitting clause (c), which explicitly prevents either party from binding the other or assuming obligations on their behalf, a contradiction is created with various sections that impose obligations on both parties (e.g., Section 7 on Indemnification, Section 8 on Insurance). Without the explicit prohibition on binding the other party, the scope of obligations and liabilities becomes ambiguous, particularly regarding third-party claims. The absence of the statement A Party will not be considered an agent of the other Party only exacerbates the issue.",

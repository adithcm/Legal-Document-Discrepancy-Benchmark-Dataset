                "explanation": "By changing the statement that 'any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed' to 'the buyer can unilaterally cancel the order at any time before the shipment' creates an in-text contradiction. The original text states neither party can cancel, where as the modified text is changing this by only enabling the buyer to be able to cancel the order.",

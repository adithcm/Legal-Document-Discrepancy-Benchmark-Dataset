Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",

Delays will not affect the due dates.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction by stating that due dates are 'guaranteed' regardless of client delays, directly contradicting the original text that allowed for delays if the client did not provide materials promptly. This creates confusion and uncertainty. Section 1(b) originally states that project timelines are subject to client dependencies. The modified text now states timelines are guaranteed irrespective of client action, contradicting the original clause in the same section.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a direct contradiction in Section 4. First, it states that the company is obligated to provide Customer Service and cannot stop, but then repeats the original clause that the Company may, at its sole discretion, cease providing Customer Service, which causes uncertainty in enforcement for Customer Service. The altered text now has a contradiction because the statement the company is obligated to provide Customer Service is followed by the original clause where the company is not obligated to provide Customer Service.",

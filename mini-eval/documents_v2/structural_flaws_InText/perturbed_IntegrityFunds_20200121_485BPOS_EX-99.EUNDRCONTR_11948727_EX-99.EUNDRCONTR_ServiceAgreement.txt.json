                "original_text": "Section 1.7 In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.7 In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity may or may not receive the excess of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter, contingent upon a yearly performance evaluation. The Fund will determine, at its sole discretion, whether any distribution and/or service fees are applicable to the Shares, regardless of the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. The applicability and amount of such fees shall be determined annually.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by making Integrity's compensation and the Fund's obligation to pay fees uncertain and discretionary, contradicting the original language which states Integrity 'shall receive' the excess of the sales price and the Fund 'shall also pay' service fees. The addition of 'may or may not' and 'contingent upon a yearly performance evaluation' regarding the excess of sales price, alongside 'will determine, at its sole discretion' regarding service fees, directly conflicts with the original agreement. This creates uncertainty about Integrity's expected revenue and the Fund's financial obligations under the agreement.",

Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such amounts as Integrity shall determine from time to time, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement.

All commissions or concessions shall be variable, determined by the Fund, and may differ significantly between dealers at the Fund's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by stating Integrity is 'prohibited' from setting commissions, conflicting with the original clause stating Integrity 'may allow commissions'. Additionally, the clause stating commissions 'shall be variable' and 'may differ significantly between dealers' directly contradicts the original expectation of commissions being 'uniform to all dealers'. This creates uncertainty on dealer compensation and potentially discriminatory practices.",

All commissions or concessions shall be variable, determined by the Fund, and may differ significantly between dealers at the Fund's discretion. Shares sold to dealers shall be for resale by such dealers only at the public offering price(s) set forth in the Fund's then current Registration Statement. The price the Fund shall receive for all Shares purchased from the Fund shall be the net asset value used in determining the public offering price applicable to the sale of such Shares."

                "explanation": "The perturbation introduces a direct contradiction regarding the term of the agreement. The original states the agreement 'shall continue automatically' with specific approval processes. The changed text states automatic renewal is 'explicitly disallowed' and continuance is based on 'sole discretion', negating the original agreement.

This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act)."

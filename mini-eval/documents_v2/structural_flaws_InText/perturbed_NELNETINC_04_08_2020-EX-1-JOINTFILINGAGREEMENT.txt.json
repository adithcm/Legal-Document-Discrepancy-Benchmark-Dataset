                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned may, at their sole discretion, choose to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, but it is not mandatory. This filing does not constitute an affirmation that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'hereby agree' to 'may, at their sole discretion, choose to' and adding 'but it is not mandatory', the clause introduces uncertainty about the commitment to jointly file. The original clause clearly indicates an agreement to jointly file, while the modified clause suggests it's optional. The added phrase, 'This filing does not constitute an affirmation that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.', directly contradicts the affirmation that it is being filed pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k), creating an in-text contradiction within the paragraph itself.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states each party is responsible for their own information's accuracy. The changed clause eliminates all responsibility, stating they are not liable. This directly contradicts the original assignment of responsibility, creating an in-text contradiction within the section. Additionally, the requirement of 'majority vote' introduces another layer of complication, as the initial clause did not contemplate any collective decision-making regarding filing amendments.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states a specific date. The changed clause introduces a retroactive effective date and a contingency for regulatory approval. This creates contradiction because the agreement is simultaneously 'effective' from a past date and potentially 'null and void' depending on future approval. This creates an internal contradiction because the agreement date stated is March 27, 2020, and in the perturbation says that it is effective retroactively to January 1, 2020. Those dates differ.",

Hearing Aids may include in-the- ear Hearing Aids (ITE), behind-the-ear Hearing Aids (BTE), or completely-in-the-canal Hearing Aids (CIC).",

Hearing Aids may include in-the- ear Hearing Aids (ITE), behind-the-ear Hearing Aids (BTE), or completely-in-the-canal Hearing Aids (CIC).",
                "explanation": "The modification of 'low power hybrid circuit' to 'high power circuit' in the definition of 'Hearing Aids' introduces an in-text contradiction. The original definition implies hearing aids are designed for low power consumption, suitable for continuous use. Changing 'low' to 'high' power directly contradicts this implicit characteristic, raising uncertainty about the hearing aids' design and usage, particularly in relation to battery life and safety. This is contradicting the definition of ALD in Section 2.1",

                "explanation": "The modification shifts the definition of 'sale' for royalty calculation from 'receipt of payment' to 'shipment of product'. This contradicts with the payment clauses under Section 4.9 where a royalty payment is paid when IntriCon is paid, introducing ambiguity about when royalties are due, especially if IntriCon offers payment plans or experiences payment delays. Introducing contradictory terms on the time when royalty payments are applied.",

Royalty Payment for HH, ALD and PADA units that incorporate Dynamic Hearing Technology shall be paid according to the table set forth below:"

                "explanation": "By changing the end of the sentence to the '1st day of January of 2009' from 'Agreement commences', we are modifying what exactly is considered confidential information. This modification creates an ambiguity in what information is protected under the confidentiality clause. The original text protects all information exchanged before the agreement, while the modified text only protects information exchanged before January 1st, 2009. Since the agreement was effective October 1st, 2008. This would cause the rest of the agreement to contradict from clause 7.0. This change causes confusion regarding the scope of confidential information. A in-text contradiction is taking place here, since now some of the data exchanged between October 1st, 2008 and January 1st, 2009, would not be considered confidential due to the edited confidential information clause.",

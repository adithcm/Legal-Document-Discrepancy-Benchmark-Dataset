This creates a contradiction regarding when the franchisee must provide notice, potentially leading to disputes about renewal eligibility. The location where the change was made is Section 2.2.1. This change creates an in-text contradiction with the rest of Section 2.2, which assumes the franchisee has a ten-year timeframe, making planning for renewal significantly affected.",

The terms of the Successor Franchise Agreement may be substantially different from the terms of this Agreement and may require the payment of different fees.\n2.2.3. You must pay all amounts owed to us, to our affiliates, and to your major suppliers; you must not be in default of this Agreement or any other agreement with us, our affiliates, or our suppliers; and you must have substantially and timely complied with all of your obligations throughout the term of each such agreement.\n2.2.4. If we inspect your Franchised Business and give you notice at least six months before the end of the term of any required maintenance, refurbishing, renovating, and upgrading (including purchasing one or more new delivery vehicles); then you must complete all such required maintenance, refurbishing, renovating, and upgrading to our reasonable satisfaction no later than 60 days before expiration of the term.\n2.2.5.

Termination By Us Without A Cure Period. We may terminate this Agreement by written notice to you, without giving you an opportunity to cure, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:\n15.2.1. You, the Operating Principal, and/or your personnel fail to complete training under Section 5.1 [Initial Training Program] to our satisfaction.\n15.2.2. You fail to open for business by the opening deadline specified in Appendix A.\n15.2.3.

You refuse to permit, or try to hinder, an examination or audit of your books and records or of the Franchised Business as provided in this Agreement.\n15.2.5. You make any material misrepresentation in connection with your application to us for the franchise, or you submit to us any report or statement that you know or should know to be false or misleading.\n15.2.6. You understate to us your Gross Revenues, by 2% or more on three or more occasions in any twelve-month period, or by 5% or more for any period of four or more consecutive weeks.\n15.2.7. You fail to operate the Franchised Business for three or more consecutive business days on which you were required to operate, unless we determine that the failure was beyond your control.\n15.2.8. You or any Owner, officer or director is convicted of a crime that we reasonably believe is likely to harm the reputation of the Pizza Fusion concept.\n15.2.9. Any Transfer occurs that does not comply with Section 14, including a failure to transfer to a qualified successor after death or disability within the time allowed by Section 14.7 [Non-Conforming Transfers].\n15.2.10. You are in default three (3) or more times under Sections 15.3 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for Monetary Default] and/or 15.4 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period] within any twelve (12) month period, whether or not the defaults are similar and whether or not they are cured.\n15.2.11. After curing a default pursuant to Sections 15.3 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for Monetary Default] or 15.4 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period], you commit the same default within twelve (12) months, whether or not the second default is cured.\n15.2.12. Any condition exists with respect to the Franchised Business that, in our reasonable judgment, seriously jeopardizes public health or safety.\n15.2.13.

You cease to operate the Franchised Business for more than seven (7) consecutive days or fourteen (14) days in any calendar year unless we approved a temporary closing or we determine, that the failure to operate was beyond your control, you otherwise abandon the Franchised Business, or you lose the right to possess the Premises or you otherwise forfeit the right to do or transact business as required under this Agreement. If, however, through no fault of you, the Premises are damaged or destroyed by an event such that repairs or reconstruction cannot be completed within ninety (90) days thereafter, you will have thirty (30) days after such event in which to apply for our approval to relocate and/or reconstruct the premises, and we will not unreasonably hold our approval.\n15.3. Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for Monetary Default. You will be in default under this Agreement if you fail, refuse, or neglect to pay when due (including if we are not able to collect payments by electronic fund transfer pursuant to Section 3.6 [Method of Payment] due to insufficient funds in your account(s), closure of your account(s), or any other reason resulting in the nonpayment) any monies owing to us, our affiliates, or any lender that has provided financing to you under this Agreement or any other agreement, or to your landlord and/or any supplier of goods or services to your Franchised Business. You will have ten (10) days after written notice of such default from us within which to remedy the default. You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 10-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require). If you do not cure the default within such 10-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require), this Agreement will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period.\n15.4 Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period. For any default not covered under Sections 15.1 [Termination By Us Without Notice], 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period], or 15.3 above, you will have thirty (30) days after written notice of default from us within which to remedy the default. You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 30-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require). If you do not cure the default within the specified time, this Agreement will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period. Any failure to comply with this Agreement, as amended or reasonably supplemented by the Manual or otherwise in writing, not covered by Sections 15.1 [Termination By Us Without Notice], 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period], or 15.3 above constitutes a default, including, but not limited to, the following:\n15.3.1. You fail, refuse, or neglect to submit to us the financial and other reports and information required under this Agreement.\n15.3.2. You fail to comply with any of the mandatory standards or procedures prescribed by us in this Agreement, the Manual, or otherwise in writing.\n15.3.3. You fail, refuse, or neglect to obtain our prior written approval or consent as required by this Agreement (other than a failure to obtain consent to a proposed Transfer, for which we may terminate without a cure period as provided in Section 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period]).\n15.3.4. For a period of fifteen (15) days, you allow a continued violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation of a governmental agency, including the failure to maintain or procure any required licenses, permits, or certifications, in the absence of a good faith dispute over its application or legality and without promptly resorting to an appropriate administrative or judicial forum for relief.\n15.3.5. You misuse or make any unauthorized use of the Proprietary Marks or otherwise materially impair our goodwill or rights in the Proprietary Marks.\n15.5. Cross-Default. Any default by you (including for this purpose your affiliates) under any other agreement with us will constitute a default under this Agreement, subject to the same provisions for notice and cure, if any, as may be applicable to the default under the other agreement."

The Transfer will be subject to the provisions of Sections 14.2 [No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent] through 14.8 [Our Right of First Refusal], as applicable, except there will be no Transfer Fee. In addition, if the deceased or incapacitated person is the Operating Principal, you must within 30 days thereafter, hire and retain a replacement, who is satisfactory to us, to perform such obligations. If a satisfactory replacement is not retained, we will have the right (but not the obligation) to take over operation of the Franchised Business, or to hire and retain a replacement on your behalf, until the Transfer is completed and to charge a reasonable management fee for these services. For purposes of this Section, \"incapacity\" means any physical or mental infirmity that will prevent the person from performing his or her obligations under this Agreement: (i) for a period of thirty (30) or more consecutive days; or (ii) for sixty (60) or more total days during a calendar year. In the case of Transfer by bequest or by intestate succession, if the heirs or beneficiaries are unable to meet the conditions of Section 14.3 [Transfer of Entire Business], the executor may transfer the decedent's interest to another successor that we have approved, subject to all of the terms and conditions for Transfers contained in this Agreement. If an interest is not disposed of under this Section 14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity] within six (6) months after the date of death or appointment of a personal representative or trustee, we may terminate this Agreement under Section 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period] below."

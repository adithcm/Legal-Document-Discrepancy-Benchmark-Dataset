                "explanation": "The modification to the definition of \"Confidential Information\" in Section 1.3, specifying that it *only* includes information explicitly marked as 'Confidential' in writing, creates a contradiction with the rest of the paragraph. The original text broadly includes various types of information *whether or not* explicitly marked. The change makes it uncertain whether the enumerated information qualifies as 'Confidential Information' if it's not explicitly labeled, potentially limiting the scope of confidentiality obligations and creating an in-text contradiction within the definition itself. Also, this definition is referenced and contradicted at Article V: Confidentiality, and it's uncertain if the types of information there should be classified as confidential.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"On2 shall promptly so notify Wildform in writing\" to \"On2 may or may not notify Wildform in writing\" introduces ambiguity. The original text mandates notification of non-conformities, while the modified text leaves it to On2's discretion. This creates a contradiction within the section. If On2 does not notify Wildform, it's unclear whether Wildform is obligated to modify the Deliverable, and it also creates uncertainty whether On2 needs to notify for modifications. Thus, creating an in-text contradiction and affects the whole text regarding software deliverables, and it is uncertain what is the next step.",

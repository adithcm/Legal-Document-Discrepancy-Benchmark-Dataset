                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"except as expressly set forth in this Amendment\" and changing the interpretation of \"Company\" or \"Companies\" to *include* VNBJ, we create an in-text contradiction. The amended clause states the JV Agreement ceases to have effect with respect to VNBJ, yet simultaneously includes it in the definition of 'Company,' implying the JV Agreement *does* still apply to VNBJ in some contexts. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall not release' to 'shall release', it directly contradicts the intention of holding parties liable for breaches prior to closing.

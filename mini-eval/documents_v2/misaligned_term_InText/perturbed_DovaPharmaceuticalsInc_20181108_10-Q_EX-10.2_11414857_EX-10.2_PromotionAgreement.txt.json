This substitution introduces an ambiguity, potentially allowing Valeant to fulfill its obligations with personnel who might not have the same qualifications or training as expected of Sales Representatives, which are specificly defined later in the agreement. This contradicts the intent of maintaining a qualified sales force, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

These responsibilities shall include mutually acceptable guidelines and procedures for the receipt, investigation, recordation, communication and exchange (as between the Parties) of safety information such as Adverse Events, lack of efficacy, misuse/abuse, and any other information concerning the safety of the Product. Such guidelines and procedures will be in accordance with, and enable the Parties and their Affiliates to fulfill, regulatory reporting obligations to Governmental Authorities.

                "explanation": "The term **'promotion fee'** is replaced by **'service fee.'** This introduces inconsistency because the contract repeatedly uses **'promotion fee'** in subsequent sections (e.g., 6.1.2, 6.2), leading to confusion about whether the fees are distinct or refer to the same concept.

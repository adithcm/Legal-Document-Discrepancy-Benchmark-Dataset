                "explanation": "The original definition explicitly excludes the full paid version and translator software. This perturbation changes the definition to *include* those versions, which directly contradicts the original intent and creates confusion on whether Google is owed compensation for distribution via those channels. This directly affects payment and exclusivity obligations, creating legal uncertainty.",

This perturbation states that goodwill will benefit both Google and the distributor which is contradictory to the original terms. In the event Google and Distributor has any dispute over goodwill, there could be ambiguity to it and further action will be required to seek clarification.",

This modification makes it optional, changing 'shall' to 'may,' which directly contradicts Google's right to enforce distribution of the latest version.

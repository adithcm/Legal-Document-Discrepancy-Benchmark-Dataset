                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The parties hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby acknowledge that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agree' to 'acknowledge' introduces a contradiction because 'agree' implies a mutual understanding and obligation to act, while 'acknowledge' simply means recognizing a fact without necessarily committing to any action. This creates uncertainty regarding the enforceability of the agreement to jointly prepare and file the schedules. The change in terminology might suggest that the parties are merely aware of the filing requirement but not necessarily bound by an obligation to actively participate in it.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'acknowledge' to 'warrant' intensifies the obligation. 'Acknowledge' implies a recognition of responsibility, while 'warrant' is a guarantee of responsibility. Then contradicting that heightened standard, by replacing 'shall not be responsible' with 'shall only make an effort' for the others information creates an in-text contradiction and drastically reduces their responsibility regarding the accuracy of the others information. One portion implies guarantee to be responsible, while other part says they only make and effort to be responsible.",

Therefore by changing the definition from \"Activity\" to \"Venture\" creates an in-text contradiction as the rest of the document uses the term \"Activity\", but section 1.1 defines this term to be \"Venture\". This makes it unclear which term is being referred to, especially in sections where the term \"Activity\" is used.",

                "explanation": "Changing the term 'Fee' to 'Consideration' in section 6.1, introduces a contradiction, as the rest of the document uses the term 'Fee' when referring to the amount PC Financial should pay Mobimagic. By changing this term to 'Consideration' this affects the enforcement of payment terms since the definition of 'Fee' is now different from what is referenced through out the rest of the contract, for example in section 6.3.",

The modified version changes this to 'THC shall defend, indemnify and hold HERC harmless.' This creates an in-text contradiction because the agreement involves multiple parties (THC, HSI, HERC), and shifting the responsibility for indemnification from HSI to THC is not consistent with the rest of the document where HSI is primarily responsible for trademark-related matters. It is unclear who is ultimately responsible for the indemnification of HERC.",

The modified version changes this to 'HERC will have the option to retain ownership and use,' making it discretionary. However, the subsequent sentence states that HERC *shall* discontinue use and abandon the trademarks upon the expiration of the Interim Period. This creates a contradiction: if HERC only has the *option* to retain ownership, the requirement to *shall* discontinue upon expiration becomes illogical. There is no certainty whether the change in the definition could create issues in ownership.",

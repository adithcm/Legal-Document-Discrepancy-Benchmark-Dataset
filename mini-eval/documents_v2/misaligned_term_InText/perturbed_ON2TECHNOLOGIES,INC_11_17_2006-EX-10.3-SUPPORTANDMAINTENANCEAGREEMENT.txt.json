The initial Primary Coordinators shall be Chris Schapdick for On2 and Jonathan Blank for Wildform. Each party may treat an act of a Primary Coordinator of another party as being authorized by such other party without inquiring behind such act or ascertaining whether such Primary Coordinator had authority to so act. Wildform and On2 shall advise each other in writing of any change in the Primary Coordinators, setting forth the name of the Primary Coordinator to be replaced and the name of the replacement, and certifying that the replacement Primary Coordinator is authorized to act for such party in all matters relating to this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Changing the defined term 'Primary Coordinators' to 'Lead Communicators' in the first sentence, while still referring to them as 'Primary Coordinators' in the subsequent sentences, creates confusion. It's unclear whether 'Lead Communicators' and 'Primary Coordinators' are intended to be the same role, which introduces ambiguity in who is authorized to act on behalf of each party. The contradiction exists in Section 2.3 where the terms are used in the same paragraph, creating a direct conflict in definition and application.",

                "explanation": "Changing the term 'Term' to 'Service Period' in Section 3.2 introduces a contradiction. 'Term' is defined in Section 9.1 as eighteen (18) months. 'Service Period' is not defined, so we do not know the duration of the support to be given and it contradicts with Section 9.1 where it is already defined the meaning of 'Term'. This creates uncertainty regarding the duration of Wildform's obligation to resolve Program Errors.",

                "explanation": "Replacing the word 'corrections' with 'modifications' in the initial clause leads to ambiguity. The term “Program Errors” in the contract refers to software issues to be resolved as a part of the Support and Maintenance Agreement. The original 'corrections' referred to fixing these errors. However, changing it to 'modifications' implies broader changes, potentially including feature enhancements or changes beyond simply fixing defects. Because Wildform is still required to apply 'modification of the product of such other companies' the in-text contradiction is in Section 1.13: Program Errors, as the nature of this is no longer clear due to the confusion as to what this term refers to.",

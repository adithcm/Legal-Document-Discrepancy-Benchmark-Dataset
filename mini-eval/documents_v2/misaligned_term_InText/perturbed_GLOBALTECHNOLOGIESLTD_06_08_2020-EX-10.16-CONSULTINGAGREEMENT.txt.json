                "original_text": "As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019.",
                "changed_text": "As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000.00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant may earn further remuneration for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019.",
                "explanation": "The perturbation replaces 'additional cash compensation' with 'further remuneration.' While seemingly similar, 'remuneration' is broader and can include non-cash benefits. This contradicts the explicit statement that the initial $250,000 is 'entire compensation' creating an ambiguity about what constitutes the Consultant's total payment, thus creating an in-text contradiction.",

In addition, the Consultant may earn further remuneration for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition. The Consultant will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the Consultant's performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. The Company will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf. The Consultant agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this Agreement. The Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest."

                "explanation": "By replacing the term 'Opportunity' with 'prospect' within the description of what constitutes confidential information, we introduce an ambiguity. The agreement defines 'Opportunity' specifically, but doesn't define 'prospect'. This implies that the protections for 'confidential information' might not extend to 'prospects,' contradicting the intent of the non-circumvention clause, which is to protect Consultant's introductions.",

The Company further acknowledges and agrees that the identity of the subject Opportunities, and all other information concerning an prospect (including without limitation, all mailing information, phone and fax numbers, email addresses and other contact information) introduced hereunder are the property of Consultant, and shall be treated as confidential information by the Company, it affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns. The Company shall not use such information, except in the context of any arrangement with Consultant in which Consultant is directly and actively involved, and never without Consultant's prior written approval. The Company further agrees that neither it nor its employees, affiliates or assigns, shall enter into, or otherwise arrange (either for it/him/herself, or any other person or entity) any business relationship, contact any person regarding such Opportunity, either directly or indirectly, or any of its affiliates, or accept any compensation or advantage in relation to such Opportunity except as directly though Consultant, without the prior written approval of Consultant. Consultant is relying on the Company's assent to these terms and their intent to be bound by the terms by evidence of their signature. Without the Company's signed assent to these terms, Consultant would not introduce any Opportunity or disclose any confidential information to the Company as herein described."

                "explanation": "Replacing 'insolvency' with 'financial distress' introduces ambiguity and a potential in-text contradiction. 'Insolvency' has a specific legal definition; 'financial distress' is broader and less defined. This change suggests the contract can be terminated for general financial difficulties, which is not the same as the legal threshold of insolvency. It directly contradicts the original intention of the clause, which was tied to a defined legal event.",

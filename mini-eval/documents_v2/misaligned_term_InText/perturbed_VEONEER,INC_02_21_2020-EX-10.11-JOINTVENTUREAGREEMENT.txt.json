                "explanation": "Changing 'except as the context otherwise requires' to 'unless explicitly stated otherwise' creates an in-text contradiction. The original implies the context can guide interpretation, while the modified version demands explicit statements. This adds an ambiguity in legal interpretation and potential for dispute.

                "explanation": "Changing 'except as the context otherwise requires' to 'regardless of context' creates an in-text contradiction. The original allows for contextual interpretation, while the modified version removes it. This adds ambiguity by demanding a literal reading of 'Company', even when it is obvious context suggests a different meaning. This change could mean references to one company now defaults as the other company. Which can lead to breaches, due to the lack of due dilligence.",

'Terms' is broader than 'provisions,' suggesting potential non-binding agreements within the agreement may no longer be relevant. Since it is regarding the agreement, it is creating a contradiction.

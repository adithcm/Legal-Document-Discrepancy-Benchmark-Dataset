                "explanation": "Changing \"Products\" and \"Product\" to \"Goods\" and \"Good\" respectively introduces ambiguity and contradicts the defined term 'Products' in Section 1.1. The contract relies on the definition of \"Product(s)\" to specify exactly what EKR is responsible for marketing, distributing, and obtaining regulatory approvals for. By using 'Good,' which is not a defined term, this modification creates uncertainty as to whether EKR's obligations extend only to the explicitly defined 'Product(s)' or to a broader range of items, leading to potential disputes over the scope of EKR's responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "By substituting 'Products' with 'Goods,' this change introduces an in-text contradiction because 'Goods' is not a defined term in the contract. This creates confusion regarding whether EKR's discretion in pricing extends only to the specifically defined 'Products' in Section 1.1 or to a broader, undefined category of items. This ambiguity undermines the clarity and enforceability of the pricing clause, leading to disagreements over pricing strategy and potentially affecting royalty calculations.",

The contract relies on the term 'Improvements' as defined in Section 1.1.

                "original_text": "The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",

If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed', it introduces uncertainty about the cancellation terms. This omission creates an in-text contradiction because while it initially states the order becomes effective upon acceptance, it removes the explicit restriction on unilateral cancellation. The contradiction arises because the section implies that once the order is effective, cancellation should follow a defined process, which is no longer clarified, leaving the enforceability of the contract uncertain in case of order cancellations.",

The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1. The remaining 20% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.2. The Letter of Credit shall be valid until 90 days after the latest shipment is effected.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'The remaining 20% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.2.', it creates an in-text contradiction. The contract specifies that 80% of payment is tied to documents in 12.1, and removes the payment terms for the remaining balance making the clause regarding 12.1 potentially unenforceable due to uncertainty regarding when the full payment will be issued. This also means Clause 12.2 will not be followed making it difficult to determine if the buyer has met the payment terms set out, creating ambiguity and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The change replaces specific timeframes for correcting 'Serious' and 'Minor' Program Errors (1 and 4 business days respectively) with the vague term 'Within a reasonable time'. This creates an in-text contradiction because the rest of the agreement still implies that there are defined correction times. This lack of specificity introduces ambiguity and makes it harder to enforce the correction obligations, potentially conflicting with the requirement for 'commercially reasonable efforts' and making 'reasonable' subjective.",

A \"Minor\" Program Error shall be defined as a bug that causes a less than substantial degradation in the performance, usability or appearance of the Deliverables."

                "explanation": "The modification removes the limit on Wildform's obligations for Deliverable Support. This creates an in-text contradiction because earlier clauses specify the support limitations. By removing the original limit, the contract now implies there is no limit, conflicting with the sections outlining specific support durations. The contradiction can make contract enforcement uncertain because there are conflicting statements of the limit of the services.",

The foregoing obligations of Wildform, shall be limited to a maximum of forty (40) hours, or up to a maximum of two hundred twenty (220) emails, whichever accumulates first.', it creates an in-text contradiction since the text is stating that Wildform will provide support but not limiting it for the website backend. Since the initial text limits the support to 40 hours and 220 emails. Thus, the removal of the limitation contradicts the implied finite nature of the support. This introduces uncertainty because it will difficult to enforce what the limit of the website back end is. ",

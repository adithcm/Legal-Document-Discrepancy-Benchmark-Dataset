                "explanation": "The original text specified that Bravatek would receive a lead-finder fee between 10% and 20% of project revenue. The modified text removes the specific percentage range and replaces it with 'to be defined in future addendums'. This creates uncertainty as the contract no longer guarantees any specific compensation, even though the obligation to pay 'a lead-finder fee' remains. This contradicts the intention of Section 4 and creates uncertainty with Bravatek's compensation.",

COMPANY and Bravatek agree to maintain in strict confidence and not to disclose or disseminate, or to use for any purposes other than performance of the projects, the Confidential Information disclosed. The obligation of non-disclosure shall not apply to the following: a. Information at or after such time that is publicly available through no fault of either party b. Information at or after such time that is disclosed to either party by a third party entitled to disclose such information c. Information which is required by law to be disclosed to federal, state or local authorities.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Confidential information' in detail, specifying its scope. By removing the initial definition, the meaning of 'Confidential Information disclosed' becomes vague. This creates an in-text contradiction as the contract references 'Confidential Information disclosed', but no longer clearly defines what information that entails, making it difficult to enforce the confidentiality obligations. This ambiguity affects the enforcement of Section 5, particularly regarding what constitutes a breach of confidentiality.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that indemnification includes 'costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs'. The modified text removes this explicit listing, only mentioning 'damages'. This creates an in-text contradiction because while the obligation to indemnify remains, the extent of what is covered by the indemnification is significantly reduced. Without the explicit mention of legal fees and court costs, it's now unclear whether these are covered, making the indemnification clause less comprehensive and creating potential disputes over its scope. This weakens the protection offered by the clause, and will contradict the definition from reasonable protections.",

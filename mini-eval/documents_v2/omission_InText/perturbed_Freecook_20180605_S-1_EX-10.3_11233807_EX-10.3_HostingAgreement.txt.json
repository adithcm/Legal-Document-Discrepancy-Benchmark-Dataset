(a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". The costs of any such changes shall be added to the Contract Price. Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",

The total sum will no longer be legally supported in section 1, where it stated it was $5,000. Section 2 now has no legal support on the 'Contract Price' as it isn't defined. This affects the enforceability of the amount owed upon completion of work",

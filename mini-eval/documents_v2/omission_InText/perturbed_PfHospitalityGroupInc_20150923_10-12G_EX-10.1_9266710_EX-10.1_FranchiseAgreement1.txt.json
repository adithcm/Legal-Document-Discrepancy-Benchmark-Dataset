If you wish to use a vehicle to provide delivery services (a \"Delivery Vehicle\") as part of your Franchised Business, you must comply with the specifications and standards that we may periodically prescribe in the Manuals for Delivery Vehicles. Our specifications and standards may include, among other things: designating Delivery Vehicles specific make and model; limitations on the Useful Life for a Delivery Vehicle and standards for maintenance or repair services.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the requirement to comply with specific standards prescribed in the Manuals for Delivery Vehicles and instead stating that the standards are “flexible”, it creates an in-text contradiction with other sections of the agreement that emphasize strict adherence to the Manuals. This omission introduces ambiguity regarding the actual standards required for delivery vehicles, affecting enforcement of vehicle-related operational standards. The removal of specific standards creates ambiguity, potentially contradicting Section 6.1 which states that you must comply with all mandatory specifications and procedures set forth from time to time in our confidential operating manual (the \"Manual\").",

Reports and Financial Statements. 8.2.1 You agree to submit financial and operational reports and records and documents to us at the times and in the manner specified in the Manual or other written instructions. You agree to submit, (a) within twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar month, a balance sheet and income statement, and (b) within ninety (90) days of the end of each fiscal year, an annual balance sheet and income statement. Upon our request, each such financial statement must accompanied by an unqualified review opinion from an independent certified public accountant acceptable to us. You or the Operating Principal must certify that the income statement and balance sheet are correct and complete and that they have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the US (or, if we request, international financial reporting standards if, by then, IFRS have been adopted in the US). You must also submit to us a complete photocopy of the Franchised Business' annual federal and state income tax returns when you file such reports with the appropriate tax authorities.",

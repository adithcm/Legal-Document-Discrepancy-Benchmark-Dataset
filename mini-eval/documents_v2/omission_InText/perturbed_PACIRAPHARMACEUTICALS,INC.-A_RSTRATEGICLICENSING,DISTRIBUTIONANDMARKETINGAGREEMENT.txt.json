Definitions 1.1 As used in this Agreement, the following words and expressions have the following meanings: \"Affiliate\" With respect to any Party to this Agreement shall mean any company, corporation, firm, individual or other entity which Controls, is Controlled by or is under common Control with such Party to this Agreement for only so long as such Control exists;",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' specifies Control through ownership or direction of management. The modified definition broadens it to any entity with a 'business relationship,' creating ambiguity. Later sections relying on the precise definition of 'Affiliate,' such as those outlining financial obligations or limitations based on control, are now uncertain and contradictory to the limited changed definition.",

Subject to Section 20.2, neither Party shall, nor shall it purport to, assign, license, transfer or change any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 20.4 either Party may assign its rights hereunder to an Affiliate or to any successor by merger, consolidation, sale of stock or other equity interests or the sale of substantially all of the assets of such Party without the consent of the other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, either Party may grant a security interest with respect to its rights under this Agreement in connection with a secured financing or similar transaction."

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Field' includes the management of post-operative pain following major orthopedic, abdominal, or pelvic surgery. By removing 'abdominal or pelvic surgery,' the definition is narrowed. This creates a contradiction with other sections that assume the 'Field' encompasses a broader range of surgeries, creating uncertainty about the scope of licensed activities.",

By omitting most of the deductions, the definition becomes vague and incomplete, specifically by removing the deductions of the deductions allowed by GAAP which effectively reduce the net selling price of Product. This omission creates an in-text contradiction with Section 6.5 which implies a need for those deductions. This omission will create huge financial exploitation for EKR since it is only reffering the deductions of freight, transport and insurance costs.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934', the agreement no longer explicitly states compliance with Rule 13d-1(k). This creates an in-text contradiction, especially if other clauses implicitly assume or depend on adherence to this rule for filing procedures or responsibilities. The contradiction arises because the agreement's purpose (joint filing under securities regulations) is undermined by the omission of the compliance statement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate', it eliminates the caveat that holds each party responsible for the other's information if they have reason to believe it's inaccurate. Without this exception, each party is only responsible for their own data, which contradicts the 'joint' nature of the filing agreement. If incorrect data is present and not challenged, there is a clear conflict.",

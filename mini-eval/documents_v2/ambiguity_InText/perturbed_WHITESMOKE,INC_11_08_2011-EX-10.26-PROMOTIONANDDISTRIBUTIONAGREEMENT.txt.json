                "explanation": "The original definition restricts 'Chrome Use Event' to specific occurrences. The modified definition broadens this to 'any event Google deems relevant,' creating uncertainty about what counts as a 'Chrome Use Event' for the purposes of royalty calculations or tracking commitment, which leads to an In-Text contradiction that can affect Clause 4.1 Payments.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the [ * ] of [ * ] by Google to Distributor for all [ * ] and all [ * ] in respect of [ * ] (as set out in Exhibit A) exceed [ * ] ([ * ]) of the [ * ] to Distributor for such [ * ]."

                "explanation": "The original text makes the distribution timeline mandatory. By changing it to 'endeavor to begin' and adding 'subject to resource availability,' the obligation becomes non-binding and discretionary. This weakens Google's ability to enforce timely distribution, contradicting earlier clauses that emphasize Distributor's obligations, specifically Clause 3.4 Launch.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows Google to unilaterally withhold overpayments. The modified version replaces this with discretionary consideration and discussion, undermining Google's right to immediate recovery of funds. This introduces a contradiction because it conflicts with Google's rights and remedies established in Clause 4.3 Payment Terms.",

                "original_text": "The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Sponsor's liability. Previously, the Sponsor was only liable for willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard. The modified text makes the Sponsor fully liable for any error of judgement or mistake of law that leads to monetary loss, even without those conditions. This creates an In-Text contradiction with section 1, Duty of the Sponsor. While section 1 states that the Sponsor’s duties are subject to the direction and control of the board of trustees, this perturbation states that they can be liable for any monetary loss derived from 'mistake of law' in the execution of their duties.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust."

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction concerning the termination of the agreement. Previously, termination was allowed without penalty. Now, a substantial penalty is imposed. This contradicts Section 3, Compensation of the Sponsor, because if the agreement is terminated, the Sponsor would no longer be compensated, potentially affecting the Sponsor's willingness to terminate even if it's in the best interest of the Trust. The modified term directly conflicts with the initially agreed-upon compensation structure.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information. 2"

                "original_text": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons; provided, however, that Domini shall not enter into any such subcontract unless the Trustees of the Trust shall have found the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that, unless the Trust otherwise expressly agrees in writing, Domini shall be as fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor as it would be for its own acts or omissions.",

                "explanation": "By removing the Trustees approval of qualified subcontractors and only holding Domini responsible in cases of gross negligence by the subcontractor, this change contradicts the Duty of the Sponsor defined in Section 1. Previously, Domini was fully responsible for subcontractors’ acts and omissions, aligning with their oversight duties. The new terms dilute that responsibility. This creates uncertainty about liability for mismanagement by subcontractors and reduces the Trust's protection.",

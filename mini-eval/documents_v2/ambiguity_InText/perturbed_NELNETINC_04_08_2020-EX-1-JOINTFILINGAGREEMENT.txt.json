                "changed_text": "The undersigned agree to prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and future filings reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, but this does not represent a joint filing agreement unless all parties explicitly confirm their agreement in writing within 5 business days of each filing.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear joint filing agreement. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the agreement is not joint unless confirmed within 5 business days. This creates an in-text contradiction because the initial statement of agreement is undermined by the conditional clause, conflicting with the purpose of the initial sentence and the entire agreements purpose.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies responsibility for timely filing and accurate information. The modified text attempts to soften this responsibility by stating that no entity will be held liable unless direct involvement or knowledge of inaccuracy can be proved. This adds an ambiguity regarding the level of due diligence expected of each party. If 'direct involvement' is difficult to prove, it contradicts the initial intention of ensuring each party's accountability in the original text.",

Company agrees to pay Consultant the compensation set forth on Exhibit A hereto for the performance of the Services.",

Company agrees to pay Consultant the compensation set forth on Exhibit A hereto for the performance of the Services.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the 'Services' are mutually agreed upon. The modified text states that the 'Services' are unilaterally determined by the Company. This creates a contradiction if the agreement elsewhere assumes that the consultant has any say in the services performed. This is an in-text contradiction because the changed definition of 'Services' directly conflicts with the expectations set by the contract that both parties are in agreement.",

This compensation will be subject to adjustment pursuant to the Company's consultant compensation policies in effect from time to time. Consultants shall be given written notice of any adjustments to compensation at least fourteen (14) days prior to adjustments becoming effective.",

This compensation will be subject to arbitrary adjustment at any time without notice. Consultants shall not have the right to dispute any such adjustments.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that adjustments to compensation will be subject to the Company's consultant compensation policies and that the Consultant will receive 14 days notice prior to any adjustments. The modified text removes the 14 day notice and states that changes to compensation are arbitrary. This causes an in-text contradiction due to a conflict in the conditions under which adjustments to compensation can be made. The original agreement establishes a compensation policy based on a certain agreement and the edited text establishes no agreement to the set compensation, therefore an in-text contradiction is being made.",

The modified text states that the contract can be unilaterally amended or modified by the Company, which establishes the in-text contradiction. The amendment introduces a contradiction regarding who has the power to alter the terms of the agreement.

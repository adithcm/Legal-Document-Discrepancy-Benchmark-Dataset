Reimbursement for pre-paid IP Costs shall be in accordance with 2 (b) 2 above.",

Initially, THI was responsible for reimbursing 'all IP Costs', but now is only responsible for 50% and not for pre-paid cost. This creates uncertainty and contradicts the original agreement on the financial responsibilities, specially when it comes to pre-paid costs.",

The original text states that Marv shall be 'reimbursed in full' for all legal expenses by THI, while the modified text limits the reimbursement to a portion (25%) and introduces requirements for proof of necessity. This creates a direct conflict on the extent of financial responsibility that THI has in regards to the legal expenses.",

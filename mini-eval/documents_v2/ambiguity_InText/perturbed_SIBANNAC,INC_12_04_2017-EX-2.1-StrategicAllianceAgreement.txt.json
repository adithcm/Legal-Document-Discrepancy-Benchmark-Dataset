                "explanation": "Changing 'non-exclusive' to 'exclusive' and 'will use its best efforts' to 'may, at its discretion' creates a contradiction. Section 1(a) now implies Bravatek is the only lead finder, but Section 2(a) requires COMPANY to list Bravatek as a 'non-exclusive alliance partner,' leading to confusion over the exclusivity of the agreement. Additionally, the term Bravatek's effort is now optional which contradict the term of diligently perform their duties.",

Payment terms will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates a clear compensation structure (10-20% lead-finder fee, payable NET 30). The modified clause introduces ambiguity by making payment discretionary and removing specific percentage guidelines. This contradicts Section 4, which creates uncertainty and a potential dispute over Bravatek's compensation, considering it was written to be mutually discussed, but not it isn't. This affect the payment due to services already render.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'twelve (12) months' to 'indefinite' and modifying the renewal terms creates a contradiction. The original text had an automatic renewal with a 90-day notice requirement, while the changed text makes the agreement indefinite, only reviewed annually. The section still states “This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.”, this creates contradiction with the new 30 days writting notice, leading to disputes over the contract's duration and termination conditions.",

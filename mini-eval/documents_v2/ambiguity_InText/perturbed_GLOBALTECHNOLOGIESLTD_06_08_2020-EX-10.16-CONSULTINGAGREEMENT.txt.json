                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for one (1) year or until Consultant completes the services requested. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be the date such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for one (1) year, with an option for automatic renewal for subsequent one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the current term. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be thirty (30) days after such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states the term is for one year or until services are complete, implying a potentially shorter duration if services finish early. The modified version introduces an automatic renewal unless notice is given, creating ambiguity. This contradicts the initial term statement, making it unclear whether the agreement automatically renews even if the consultant completes services within the initial year. The termination notice period has also been changed, which introduces contradiction with how termination is handled in the original text. These changes create an In-Text Contradiction between the different termination conditions of the original and modified text.",

Consultant's duty is to identify prospective acquisition/joint venture companies for the Company. Consultant will in no way act as a \"broker-dealer\" under state securities laws. Because all final decisions pertaining to any particular investment are to be made by the Company, the Company may be required to communicate directly with potential acquisition/joint venture prospective companies.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that the Consultant cannot guarantee results. The modification introduces a contradiction by stating the Consultant 'guarantees specific financial results,' which are supposedly detailed in Appendix B. This creates an internal contradiction because the original statement negates any guarantees, while the new statement affirms them. This contradiction creates ambiguity regarding the Consultant's obligations and potential liabilities if those 'guaranteed' results are not met. This change introduces ambiguity as there is now an implicit guarantee which is not being fulfilled, thus the text contradicts itself. Additionally, the changed text contradicts Section 4, Standard of Performance.",

                "explanation": "The original allows several methods of notice. The modified version mandates BOTH overnight delivery AND email, eliminating all other options. It then changes the delivery timeframe, as well. The original section specifies delivery times for each method (personal, fax, overnight, mail). This alteration creates an In-Text Contradiction because in other sections within the text, the other methods may have been utilized for notices. The contradiction makes it impossible to verify if all other notices being given in the original format are applicable to the new format.

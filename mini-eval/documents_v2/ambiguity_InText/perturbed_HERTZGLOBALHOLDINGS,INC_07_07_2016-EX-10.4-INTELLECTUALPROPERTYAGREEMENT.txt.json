                "explanation": "The definition of 'Interim Period' is changed from four years to two years. This introduces a contradiction because various sections of the contract rely on the 'Interim Period' being four years long, particularly sections concerning the duration of licenses and permitted use of trademarks. This affects the interpretation of timelines related to intellectual property rights, creating uncertainty in enforcement. Specifically, section 2.2.1 states that HERC shall discontinue use of certain trademarks upon expiration of the Interim Period, so the question is what the real period, which is now contradicted.",

This changes the responsibility and right of initiating action for trademark infringement from HSI to HERC, contradicting the later clause which states, 'HSI may authorize HERC to initiate such action in HERC's name.' making it unclear who has the ultimate authority and decision to initiate the infringements.",

                "explanation": "The original text states an 'unconditional guarantee,' creating a strict liability. The modified version introduces 'best efforts,' which is a weaker standard and lessens the guarantor's obligation. This contradicts the original intent of an unconditional guarantee.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates guarantors pay 'all monies'. The modified text introduces 'some of the monies,' creating ambiguity and reducing the guarantor's financial commitment. This introduces a contradiction regarding the extent of monetary responsibility.",

Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect, except if the Master Franchise Agreement is deemed unenforceable against Master Franchisee, under which conditions this Guarantee shall be reviewed and potentially adjusted by mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the guarantor's obligations remain unaffected by the unenforceability of the Master Franchise Agreement. The modified version introduces an exception, making the guarantor's obligation contingent and subject to review. This directly contradicts the initial assertion that the guarantee is unaffected by unenforceability.",

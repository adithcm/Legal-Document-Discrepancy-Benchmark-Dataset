                "original_text": "13. Insurance: During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with a Best's rating of A+. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 30 days' notice for cancellation of policy and 10 days' notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",
                "changed_text": "13. Insurance: During the term of this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $1,000,000 per occurrence and $1,000,000 aggregate. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 15 days' notice for cancellation of policy and 5 days' notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction regarding the required insurance coverage amount and notice period. Originally the agreement stipulated coverage of $2,000,000 per occurrence and aggregate, with a Best's rating of A+ and notice periods of 30 and 10 days, respectively. The modified version reduces the coverage to $1,000,000 and lowers the notice periods to 15 and 5 days respectively, and also omits the Best's rating requirement. This creates an internal contradiction and uncertainty regarding the insurance obligations of the Company.",

Termination: Before expiration of the Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon: (i) any material breach of the Agreement by the other Party, if such breach is not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party within ten (10) business days after written notice; (ii) ten (10) business days written notice to the other Party whenever the notifying Party in its sole discretion determines that the continuation of the Agreement will damage its reputation or good will; or (iii) written notice in the event one Party (a) becomes or is declared insolvent or bankrupt or is subject to the appointment of a trustee or receiver or any equivalent thereof, (b) is the subject of any proceeding related to its liquidation or insolvency (whether voluntary or involuntary) which is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, (c) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (d) is subject to any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to any entity; or (e) is subject to a change of control (whether by merger, stock transfer or otherwise), except in the case of an initial public offering.",

Termination: Before expiration of the Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon: (i) any material breach of the Agreement by the other Party, if such breach is not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party within thirty (30) business days after written notice; (ii) five (5) business days written notice to the other Party whenever the notifying Party in its sole discretion determines that the continuation of the Agreement will damage its reputation or good will; or (iii) written notice in the event one Party (a) becomes or is declared insolvent or bankrupt or is subject to the appointment of a trustee or receiver or any equivalent thereof, (b) is the subject of any proceeding related to its liquidation or insolvency (whether voluntary or involuntary) which is not dismissed within sixty (60) days, (c) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (d) is subject to any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to any entity; or (e) is subject to a change of control (whether by merger, stock transfer or otherwise), except in the case of an initial public offering.",
                "explanation": "The original termination clause allows for termination due to material breach if not remedied within 10 business days and 90 days for liquidation or insolvency. The modified clause changes this to 30 business days for remedying a material breach and 60 days for dismissal of liquidation or insolvency, but also changes 10 business days written notice to 5 business days, creating a contradiction within the same section of the contract, and hence ambiguity over the correct timeframe for remediation or notice.",

                "explanation": "The original section 8 allows the Association sole discretion in approving the use of Association Marks and provides a five-day turnaround for approval. In contrast, the modified version changes the Association's discretion to a 'reasonable discretion' standard and extends the approval timeframe to ten days. Further, the modified version states that failure to have the material reviewed can be considered a breach of the agreement, but not cause for immediate cancellation, contrary to the original language. This introduces an in-text contradiction by giving different standards for approval and timelines, creating ambiguity and dispute over the approval process and the consequences of not following the procedure.",

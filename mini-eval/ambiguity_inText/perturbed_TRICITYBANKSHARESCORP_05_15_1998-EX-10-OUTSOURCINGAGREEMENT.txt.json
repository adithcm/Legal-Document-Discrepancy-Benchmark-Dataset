                "explanation": "The original definition specifies completion of conversion for *all* banks, whereas the modified version indicates the start date is when *one* bank is converted, creating ambiguity. This could cause disputes over billing and service level agreements tied to the commencement date.",

                "explanation": "The Term is originally clearly defined as starting on the Effective Date and ending eight years after the Commencement Date. By changing it to eight years after the *Effective* Date, there is ambiguity, since the Commencement Date could be later, therefore shortening the service period. If the Commencement Date is later, Customer pays without full services for a while. If Customer insists on eight years of services after the *Commencement* Date, M&I will need to provide extra services without pay. This creates an internal contradiction.",

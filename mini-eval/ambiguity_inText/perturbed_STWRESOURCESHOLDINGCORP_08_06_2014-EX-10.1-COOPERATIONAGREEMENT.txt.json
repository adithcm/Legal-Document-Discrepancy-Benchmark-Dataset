                "original_text": "Subject to the other provisions contained herein, this AGREEMENT shall be for a term of thirty (30) years from the Effective Date, which shall automatically renew from year-to-year thereafter unless terminated by a Party upon sixty (60) days' written notice after the end of the term. Notwithstanding the 30-year term of this agreement, should STW procure sales agreements with customers for a duration of longer than 30 years, STW shall be authorized to maintain and service such contract(s) to the extent of the water volume(s) purchased, and this AGREEMENT shall not terminate during the initial term of any such water supply agreement with a term extending beyond this AGREEMENT.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the other provisions contained herein, this AGREEMENT shall be for a term of thirty (30) years from the Effective Date, which shall automatically renew from year-to-year thereafter unless terminated by a Party upon sixty (60) days' written notice at any time after the first 10 years of the term. Notwithstanding the 30-year term of this agreement, should STW procure sales agreements with customers for a duration of longer than 30 years, STW shall only be authorized to maintain and service such contract(s) to the extent of the water volume(s) purchased within the initial 30 year term.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for contract continuation if STW has sales agreements beyond 30 years. The modified text limits this authorization to the initial 30-year term, creating a contradiction regarding the contract's duration and STW's rights beyond the initial term. The original text states sixty (60) days' written notice after the end of the term, but in the modified text, it can be at any time after the first 10 years of the term, implying STW's rights after certain sales agreements.",

STW shall also provide to COFS three (3) million GPD of CRA water at no cost to COFS at such time that COFS requests delivery of the water for COFS use. Each payment made by STW to COFS will include an accounting statement providing the number of gallons sold, the price paid by any customer(s), the gross revenues received by STW, and the expenses paid by STW for the sale, treatment, use, and/or delivery of the CRA water. STW shall calculate the amount owed to COFS every one hundred-eighty (180) days (\"Accrual Period\"), and shall provide required payments to COFS within thirty (30) days after the end of the previous Accrual Period.",
                "changed_text": "STW shall pay COFS a seventeen percent (17%) royalty of the price STW receives per 1,000 gallons of CRA water produced from the Property and sold, unless the water is sold for industrial use, in which case no royalty is paid. STW shall also provide to COFS three (3) million GPD of CRA water at a cost of $0.01 per gallon to COFS at such time that COFS requests delivery of the water for COFS use. Each payment made by STW to COFS will include an accounting statement providing the number of gallons sold, the price paid by any customer(s), the gross revenues received by STW, and the expenses paid by STW for only the delivery of the CRA water. STW shall calculate the amount owed to COFS every one hundred-eighty (180) days (\"Accrual Period\"), and shall provide required payments to COFS within ninety (90) days after the end of the previous Accrual Period.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 17% royalty on all water sales and free water to COFS. The modified text introduces exceptions, stating no royalty for industrial use and a cost for water provided to COFS. Furthermore, the payment term of the original text specifies 30 days of the Accrual Period, whereas the modified text changes it to 90 days. This creates a conflict regarding payment responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that STW is responsible for constructing, maintaining, operating, owning, and repairing the wells. The modified text flips this, making COFS responsible for operating, maintaining, owning and repairing. Also, the original text indicates that COFS or its authorized representatives can enter upon premises at reasonable times, but in the modified text, it states that STW or its authorized representatives can do that, creating in-text contradiction. In addition, the original text says when the wells are abandoned it should comply with the requirements of Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District, TDLR, and/or TCEQ, but the modified text only enforces the applicable regulatory requirements of the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the Arizona Assigned IP is that which is used or held for use 'exclusively' in the Company Field 'as of' specific dates. The modification changes these phrases to use or held for use in the company Field 'at any point before' the specific dates. This creates an ambiguity because it is now unclear whether assets used briefly in the Company Field and then discontinued would qualify as \"Arizona Assigned IP,\" or if assets currently used in the company field but were not in use as of the specific dates would also qualify.",

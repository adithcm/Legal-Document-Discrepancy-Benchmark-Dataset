For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means an equity or income interest of fifty percent (50%) or more, or the possession of the power, directly or indirectly, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Affiliate, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.",

For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means an equity or income interest of thirty percent (30%) or more, or the possession of the power, directly or indirectly, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Affiliate, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'control' for Affiliates of Village Media Company and PFHOF is now inconsistent. For Village Media Company, control remains at 50%, but for PFHOF, it is reduced to 30%. This introduces ambiguity. If a company has a 40% equity interest in PFHOF, it would be considered an affiliate of PFHOF under the modified definition but not Village Media Company under original definition, leading to potential disagreements regarding rights and obligations.",

For purposes of this Section 4.4, a \"Change of Control\" shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions that results in (including by way of merger or consolidation), or that is in connection with, the Village Media Company no longer being controlled (as defined in Section 1.2) by or under common control (as defined in Section 1.2) with HOFV.",

                "explanation": "The definition of Change of Control now contradicts the definition of 'control' used in Section 1.2. Section 4.4 originally defined Change of Control as the Village Media Company no longer being controlled by or under common control with HOFV, referencing the 'control' definition in section 1.2, which defines control with specific numerical thresholds (50% equity or power to direct management). The modified text now states control needs to be with 'a publicly traded entity' meaning that if HOFV, which is the original controlling interest, is sold to a private entity, then the Change of Control condition is met despite there being a controlling power. This can lead to disputes about whether termination is valid.",

For clarity, if for any calendar year during the Term, the amount of License Fees for such calendar is (x) less than the amount of the Annual Guarantee, the Village Media Company shall still be required to pay the Annual Guarantee for such calendar year or (y) more than the Annual Guarantee, the Village Media Company shall be required to pay all License Fees in excess of the Annual Guarantee for such calendar year.",

                "explanation": "Originally, the License Fee was determined by mutual agreement of both parties. The definition of License Fee is now changed so it is solely determined by Village Media Company which conflicts with the intention of the original text. In the event that the original contract is enforced on this section, both parties need to determine the fee, and the updated text violates the original text as it implies that only the Village Media company determines it.",

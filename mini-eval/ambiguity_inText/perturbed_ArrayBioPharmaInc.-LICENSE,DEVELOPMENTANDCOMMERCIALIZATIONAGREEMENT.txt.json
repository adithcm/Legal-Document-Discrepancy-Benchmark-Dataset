As used in this Section 1.1, the word \"control\" (including, with correlative meaning, the terms \"controlled by\" or \"under the common control with\") shall mean the actual power, either directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such entity, whether by the ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting share capital in such person, corporation, or other entity, or by contract or otherwise.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Affiliate' by suggesting control can exist even with less than 50% ownership. This contradicts the initial, more stringent definition requiring more than 50% ownership for control.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original 'Control' definition. The original definition explicitly states that 'Control' means the ability to grant licenses without violating Third-Party agreements. The altered definition suggests that a Party can still have 'Control' even when doing so violates a Third-Party agreement.",

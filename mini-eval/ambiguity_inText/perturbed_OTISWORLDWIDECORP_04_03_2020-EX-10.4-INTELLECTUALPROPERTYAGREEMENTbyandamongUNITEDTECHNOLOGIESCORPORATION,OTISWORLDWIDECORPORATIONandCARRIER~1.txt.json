                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, unless explicitly stated otherwise in a subsequent section, the following terms shall have the following meanings. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Article I or elsewhere in this Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the SDA.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by suggesting that definitions provided in Article I may be overridden later in the document, creating potential inconsistencies. It is not clear when the definitions in the article should be considered, and when not.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' is changed in the article about Trademarks, creating uncertainty. The main definition is for a member of a Party Group, which is limiting, and in Article IV, it is defined to be any entity controlled by the party, which creates an internal contradiction as a third party might rely on either definition.",

Details of such agreements will be outlined in Schedule 3.1.2(a).",

The original clause has a clearly outlined exception but the modified version creates an 'unless otherwise agreed' clause, leading to an inconsistent definition of the permitted license group field of use.",

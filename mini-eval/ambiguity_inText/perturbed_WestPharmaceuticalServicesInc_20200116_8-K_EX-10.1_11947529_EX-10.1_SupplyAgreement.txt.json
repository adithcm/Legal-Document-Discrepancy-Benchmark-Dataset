                "original_text": "Payment for Product shall be made in U.S. Dollars and shall be due, in good funds in Seller's account, no later than thirty (30) days after the date of shipment. With respect to any monetary obligations of Buyer or Buyer's affiliates owed to Seller, Seller may (i) set-off such obligations against any sums owing to Buyer or Buyer's affiliates; and/or (ii) recoup such obligation from any amounts paid to Buyer or Buyer's affiliates by Seller.",
                "changed_text": "Payment for Product shall be made in U.S. Dollars and shall be due, in good funds in Seller's account, no later than sixty (60) days after the date of shipment. With respect to any monetary obligations of Buyer or Buyer's affiliates owed to Seller, Seller may (i) set-off such obligations against any sums owing to Buyer or Buyer's affiliates; and/or (ii) recoup such obligation from any amounts paid to Buyer or Buyer's affiliates by Seller.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. Attachment E specifies different payment terms based on location, but Attachment A dictates a blanket 30-day period. Changing Attachment A to 60 days creates uncertainty, as it conflicts with Attachment E's regionally varying terms and could lead to disputes over which payment term applies.",

Seller warrants that all products sold hereunder are free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of shipment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding warranties. The original text disclaims all warranties except for conformance to specifications. The modification adds a one-year warranty against defects, creating ambiguity as to the extent of the seller's liability and conflicting with the initial disclaimer. This could lead to disputes over whether defects are covered and for how long.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the governing law. The main agreement specifies in ORDER OF PRECEDENCE clause  that this agreement will prevail except with respect to the governing law specified in attachments. Modifying the governing law of Attachment G from Singapore law to Delaware law introduces conflict as the main agreement also state that it is governed by the law set forth in attachments. This can creates disputes over which jurisdiction's laws apply.",

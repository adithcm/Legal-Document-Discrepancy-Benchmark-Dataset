Franchisor and Franchisee shall agree upon and decide the locations at which the Smaaash Centres shall be set up within the Territory. The Franchisee shall not be entitled to set up any new Smaaash Centres without consulting with, and obtaining the prior written consent of Smaaash. (b) The prices of the products and services offered in each of the Smaaash Centres shall be decided mutually among the parties. Any revision to the agreed fees, including any discounts or prizes or other promotional measures shall require the prior written consent from Franchisor.",

Franchisor and Franchisee shall agree upon and decide the locations at which the Smaaash Centres shall be set up within the Territory. The Franchisee is fully authorized to set up new Smaaash Centres and is not obligated to consult with, or obtain consent from the Franchisor. (b) The prices of the products and services offered in each of the Smaaash Centres shall be determined solely by the Franchisee. Franchisee is not required to seek the Franchisor's consent for any revision to the agreed fees, including any discounts or prizes or other promotional measures.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Franchisee's autonomy in setting up new Smaaash Centres and deciding prices. Initially, the Franchisee needs Franchisor's consent, but later, this requirement is removed, creating confusion about the level of control the Franchisee has.",

Franchisee shall also be obligated to identify suitable locations to set up the Smaaash Centres. Franchisee shall comply with, and ensure that the third party sub-franchisees comply with the standards prescribed by Franchisor (as provided in the operating manuals which shall be shared by Franchisor with Franchisee) with respect to the services, products and operations of the Smaaash Centres and shall operate the Smaaash Centres in strict conformity with such standards and specifications as Franchisor may from time to time prescribe to Franchisee. Franchisee shall refrain from deviating from such standards and specifications without Franchisor's prior written consent and from otherwise operating in any manner which reflects adversely on the Trademarks and Smaaash Centres.",

Franchisee is encouraged but not required to identify suitable locations to set up the Smaaash Centres. The Franchisee is not obligated to comply with standards set by the Franchisor, or to ensure that third party sub-franchisees comply with the same. The standards will be taken into account but the Franchisee will have ultimate control over how the Smaaash Centres are operated. Franchisee has the discretion to deviate from any such standards and specifications without Franchisor's prior written consent.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original text by weakening the obligation of the Franchisee to adhere to the Franchisor's standards. 'Best efforts' is replaced with 'reasonable endeavors,' making the marketing obligation less stringent. The requirement to identify suitable locations is made optional, and the Franchisee is allowed to deviate from standards, even without consent. This creates uncertainty around the consistency and quality of Smaaash Centres.",

This Agreement may be terminated by either party for \"Cause\" without the need of providing a notice period prior to such termination becoming effective. \"Cause\" shall exist if circumstances occur which, taking into consideration the substance and purpose of this Agreement, would make it unreasonable for one or both of the parties to continue the contractual relationship and the other party fails to cure the cause (assuming that such cause is susceptible to cure) within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of a corresponding written notice (\"Remedy Notice\"). If such cause by its nature is not curable, then no such Remedy Notice is required. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a party may terminate this Agreement for \"Cause\"if: (a) the other party to this Agreement is in breach of one or more of its material obligations; or (b) the other party to this Agreement becomes insolvent, generally cannot pay its obligations when due or otherwise suffers a substantial deterioration of its financial situation, or if insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings are initiated against such party or such party initiates any dissolution or liquidation of its business and/or assets.",

This Agreement may only be terminated by the Franchisor for \"Cause\" without the need of providing a notice period prior to such termination becoming effective. \"Cause\" shall exist only if the Franchisee engages in illegal activities that harm the Franchisor's reputation.

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding who can terminate the agreement for cause. The original text allows either party to terminate for cause, but the modified text initially states only the Franchisor can terminate. However, the following sentences then describe conditions under which the Franchisor can terminate, implying that the Franchisee cannot, although the earlier sentence is now more focused on illegal activities. This creates uncertainty about the Franchisee's rights in the event of the Franchisor's breach or other significant issues.",

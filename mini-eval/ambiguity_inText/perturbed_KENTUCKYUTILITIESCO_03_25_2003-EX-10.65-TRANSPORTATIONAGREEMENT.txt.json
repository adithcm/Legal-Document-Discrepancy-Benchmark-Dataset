                "original_text": "1.1 TRANSPORTATION QUANTITY - shall mean the maximum daily quantity of gas which Transporter agrees to receive and transport on a firm basis, subject to Article II herein, for the account of Shipper hereunder on each day during each year during the term hereof, which shall be 51,000 dekatherms. Any limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery shall be as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 TRANSPORTATION QUANTITY - shall mean the typical daily quantity of gas which Transporter intends to receive and transport on a firm basis, subject to Article II herein, for the account of Shipper hereunder on each day during each year during the term hereof, which shall be approximately 51,000 dekatherms. Any limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery shall be as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'TRANSPORTATION QUANTITY' clearly defines it as the 'maximum daily quantity.' The modified definition changes this to 'typical daily quantity' and 'approximately 51,000 dekatherms', introducing ambiguity and uncertainty. This creates a contradiction because the original definition enforces a firm commitment for a maximum amount, while the revised definition suggests a more flexible, non-binding expectation.",

                "original_text": "Transportation Service - Transporter agrees to accept and receive daily on a firm basis, at the Point(s) of Receipt from Shipper or for Shipper's account such quantity of gas as Shipper makes available up to the Transportation Quantity, and to deliver to or for the account of Shipper to the Point(s) of Delivery an Equivalent Quantity of gas.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the Transporter 'agrees to accept and receive daily on a firm basis,' which creates a strong obligation. The modified version replaces this with 'intends to accept and receive daily, when feasible' and 'will endeavor to deliver', weakening the obligation to a mere intention or effort. This creates a conflict because the term 'firm basis' is now contradicted by the qualifier 'when feasible,' making the obligation non-binding and discretionary.",

If the FERC or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the service rendered pursuant to this Agreement authorizes abandonment of such service, this Agreement shall terminate approximately on the abandonment date permitted by the FERC or such other governmental body.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the contract 'shall be effective' and 'shall remain in force', presenting a clear and definite timeline. The modified text changes this to 'may be effective' and 'is intended to remain in force' and 'approximately on the abandonment date,' introducing uncertainty about the contract's start date, duration, and termination. This creates a contradiction because the original version mandates a specific term, while the modified version suggests the term is subject to conditions and approximations.",

                "original_text": "Dolphin agrees to complete its photo-editing services within 14 days of receiving the original digital photo files. The completed files must meet DGT pre-defined standards for finished products;",
                "changed_text": "Dolphin agrees to complete its photo-editing services within 14 days of receiving the original digital photo files. The completed files must meet DGT pre-defined standards for finished products; Alternatively, Dolphin can deliver within 21 days if they notify DGT within 3 days of receiving the files.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the delivery timeframe. Initially, it's strictly 14 days. The modified version adds an exception allowing 21 days under certain conditions, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over which timeframe applies.",

Dolphin shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement only after DGT fails to meet a material obligation hereunder and only after Dolphin has given DGT written notice of such failure and only after the DGT has not rectified such failure within 30 days of the notice.",
                "changed_text": "DGT shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement if Dolphin fails to meet its requirements and material obligation hereunder and only after DGT have given Dolphin written notice of such failure and only after Dolphin has not rectified such failure within 10 days of the notice. Dolphin shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement only after DGT fails to meet a material obligation hereunder and only after Dolphin has given DGT written notice of such failure and only after the DGT has not rectified such failure within 30 days of the notice. However, Dolphin can terminate this agreement with immediate effect in writing notification if it is able to show circumstances which it considers a material breach.",
                "explanation": "This adds a contradiction regarding Dolphin's ability to terminate the contract. The original text requires a 30-day rectification period. The modification allows immediate termination if Dolphin deems there's a 'material breach' they can demonstrate, creating ambiguity as to which termination clause is valid and what constitutes sufficient demonstration.",

The price per unit shall be open to renegotiation - in response to competitive pricing pressures - upon receipt of written notice at any time by either party; however, the price for the first 10,000 photos each month will remain fixed at USD1.50.",
                "explanation": "While the original clause allows for renegotiation of the price per photo, the addition of a fixed price for the first 10,000 photos introduces a contradiction. It's unclear if the renegotiation clause applies to those first 10,000 photos, creating uncertainty about the pricing structure and potentially leading to disputes over billing.",

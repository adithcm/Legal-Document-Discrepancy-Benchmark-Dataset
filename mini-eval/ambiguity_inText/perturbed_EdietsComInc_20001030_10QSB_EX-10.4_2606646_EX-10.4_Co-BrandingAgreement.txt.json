The modified text introduces ambiguity by adding \"knowingly\", \"unless Women.com deems another provider more suitable\" and \"generally avoid\", which weakens the commitment and makes enforcement uncertain. This allows Women.com to potentially work with competitors under certain interpretations, conflicting with the original intent of exclusivity.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear payment schedule and limits on how Women.com can increase the payment. The modified text changes 'no fewer than sixty (60) days prior written notice' to 'with reasonable notice', 'not increase the Payment Schedule more than once in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months' to 'may increase the Payment Schedule multiple times in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months', and 'may not exceed twenty percent (20%)' to 'may not exceed fifty percent (50%)'.

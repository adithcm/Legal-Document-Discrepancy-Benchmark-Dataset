The  following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning:\n\n\n1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America),  APAC (Asia Pacific, including Australia and other than India and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and  Japan.",
                "changed_text": "1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement. The  following terms, as used herein, have the following meaning:\n\n\n1.1. \"Accuray Regions\" means Accuray's sales regions specifically for CyberKnife products and services (as of the Effective Date) of the Americas (North America and South America),  APAC (Asia Pacific, excluding Australia, India, and Japan), EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East, and Africa), and  Japan.",
                "explanation": "The original definition broadly defines 'Accuray Regions' for sales. The modified definition restricts it to 'CyberKnife products and services' and alters the countries included within APAC, creating confusion about the scope of regions for other Accuray products or general business dealings.",

Distributor shall be and must at all times make it clear that it is an independent entity contracting with  Accuray, and is not the employee, representative or agent of Accuray. Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter  into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner.",

Distributor shall be and must at all times make it clear that it is an independent entity contracting with  Accuray, and is not the employee, representative or agent of Accuray, except when explicitly authorized by Accuray in writing. Distributor does not have the ability or authority to enter  into any legal agreements or obligations that would bind Accuray in any manner, unless such authority is expressly delegated to the Distributor by Accuray.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes the distributor as fully independent. The change introduces an exception, stating that they *can* act as an agent or bind Accuray if authorized, which directly contradicts the initial assertion of complete independence. This ambiguity undermines the defined relationship and creates uncertainty regarding liability.",

                "explanation": "The original text states Accuray is responsible for 'ensuring products supplied are of good quality', implying a high standard. The changed text lowers the standard to 'meeting minimum quality standards'. This creates a contradiction if elsewhere in the agreement a higher quality is expected or implied.",

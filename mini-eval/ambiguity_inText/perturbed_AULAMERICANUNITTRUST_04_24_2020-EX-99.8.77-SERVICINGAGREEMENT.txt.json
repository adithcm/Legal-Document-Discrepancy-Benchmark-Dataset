                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original text allows for multiple methods of communication (mailed, telegraphed, telexed, etc.) while the modified version restricts communication to only mail. If another section relies on urgent communication via electronic means, this change could cause issues with proper notification. The definition of valid notice is now ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'if known' from 'TIN', this creates a contradictory obligation. The original text implies that providing the TIN is only mandatory if it is known. Now, it suggests that the servicing agent must provide TIN, regardless of whether the Servicing agent knows it or not. This leads to potential breaches due to an inability to fully comply with the instruction",

                "explanation": "The text originally defined the Trustees as acting in their capacity as trustees, specifically excluding individual liability. By changing 'not individually or personally' to 'individually and personally', this introduces a direct contradiction. The agreement now implies that trustees can be held individually liable, conflicting with the standard understanding of a trust and creating legal uncertainty about their responsibilities.",

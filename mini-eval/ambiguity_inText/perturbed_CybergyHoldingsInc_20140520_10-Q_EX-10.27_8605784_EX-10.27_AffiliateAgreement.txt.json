                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Clients' included corporate users, government agencies, and educational facilities. The modified version adds a contradictory clause restricting 'Clients' to only government agencies within the same section.

The change allows Company to modify the quota at its 'sole discretion', removing the 'mutual agreement' requirement.

                "original_text": "AJR shall use its best efforts to promote the name, image, brand and reputation of XC and the products and services of XC. In addition, AJR shall assist XC in evaluating various applications of wearable and wireless devices to automobile racing including -2- potential applications for the use of devices at the track, in the pits, in the stands and generally for crowd control.",
                "changed_text": "AJR shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the name, image, brand and reputation of XC and the products and services of XC. In addition, AJR is not obligated to assist XC in evaluating various applications of wearable and wireless devices to automobile racing including -2- potential applications for the use of devices at the track, in the pits, in the stands and generally for crowd control.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the level of commitment required from AJR. Initially, AJR was expected to use their 'best efforts' in promotion and assistance. The modified text reduces this obligation to 'commercially reasonable efforts' which is a lower standard, and removes the obligation of assistance altogether. This creates an ambiguity as other sections might refer to AJR's promotional duties, potentially causing disputes over the level of effort required.",

AJR is not obligated to provide XC with any information regarding AJR, and XC remains fully responsible for any material misstatement or material omission with respect to such information",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause requiring AJR to provide information to XC for the registration statement and to indemnify XC for any misstatements or omissions related to that information. By stating AJR is 'not obligated' to provide any information and remains fully responsible, it becomes unclear who is responsible for providing accurate information for the registration statement, and if AJR has any liability for errors, potentially causing disputes.",

Neither party shall have the right to use the corporate name of the other.",
                "changed_text": "AJR shall take commercially reasonable measures to avoid actions or events by the Team or others that could significantly harm XC's reputation or the value of its licensed materials, unless approved in advance by both parties. AJR shall have the right to use the corporate name of the other with the consent of the other party.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of AJR's responsibility and the conditions under which the corporate names of both parties can be used. Initially, AJR was strictly prohibited from actions that could adversely affect XC, and neither party could use the corporate name of the other. The modified version now states that AJR must take 'commercially reasonable measures,' which is open to interpretation and less strict. Now, there is allowance for use of the corporate name, but there is a confusion about when the consent is and isn't required.",

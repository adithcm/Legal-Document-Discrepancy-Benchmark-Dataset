Customer acknowledges that Metavante's execution of the Form 4804 Affidavit or the equivalent form with the Department on Customer's behalf does not relieve Customer of responsibility to provide accurate TINs or liability for any penalties which may be assessed for failure to comply with TIN requirements.",

Customer acknowledges that Metavante's execution of the Form 4804 Affidavit or the equivalent form with the Department on Customer's behalf completely relieves Customer of responsibility to provide accurate TINs or liability for any penalties which may be assessed for failure to comply with TIN requirements.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding Metavante's authority related to IRS and Department of Treasury filings. The original text appoints Metavante as attorney-in-fact to take 'all appropriate actions,' while the modified text limits Metavante to 'only actions specifically directed by the Customer.' Simultaneously, one definition says that Metavante's execution of affidavit does not relieve responsibility, while the other completely relieves the customer. This contradiction could lead to disputes about whether Metavante can independently authorize information release to states and who is ultimately responsible for TIN accuracy.",

Metavante shall cure any failure to achieve a Service Level within the period specified within the applicable schedule.

                "explanation": "The original text outlines that if Metavante does not meet a certain service level, it will cure within a period and be subject to the remedies listed in the Schedule. The changed text implies that Metavante is not required to cure anything and no remedies will be provided, this introduces uncertainty and internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text assigns tax responsibilities between Customer and Metavante. The modified text assigns all tax responsibilities to Customer. This is an internal contradiction, as one definition of 'tax responsibilities' makes the customer responsible, and the other clearly makes the customer and Metavante responsible.",

In coordination with Imprimis, calling on potential clients including, but not limited to, doctors, practitioners, practice groups,  surgical centers, hospitals and other prescribers (collectively \"Clients\") and assisting in the promotion, marketing and generation of inbound sales and prescription orders for the Product in the Territory.",

Calling on potential clients including, but not limited to, doctors, practitioners, practice groups, surgical centers, and hospitals (collectively \"Clients\") and assisting in the promotion, marketing and generation of inbound sales and prescription orders for the Product in the Territory. For purposes of determining sales commissions, the term Clients shall mean only those entities that have a pre-existing relationship with Imprimis.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Clients' broadly as potential clients. The modified text adds a contradictory definition of 'Clients' only referring to those with a pre-existing relationship with Imprimis for commission purposes. This creates ambiguity regarding which 'Clients' qualify for sales commissions.",

However, the Sales Team is empowered to address specific client inquiries by providing assurances based on their professional experience even if not explicitly detailed in the marketing materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly limits the Sales Team to only using authorized materials for claims/warranties. The modified text introduces a contradictory exception, allowing them to provide assurances based on their professional experience. This contradicts the explicit limitation and creates uncertainty around the scope of permissible claims.",

However, Imprimis may only terminate this agreement if Surgical has not met its obligations as outlined in the SOW. Expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not limit any obligations of a party that were incurred prior to such expiration or termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants both parties the unconditional right to terminate at any time. The modified text introduces a condition on Imprimis's right to terminate, limiting it to instances where Surgical has failed to meet its SOW obligations. This directly contradicts the initial statement and creates confusion about the termination rights of Imprimis.",

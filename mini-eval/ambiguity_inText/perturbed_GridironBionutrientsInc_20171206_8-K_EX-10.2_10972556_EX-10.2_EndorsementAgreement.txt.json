                "explanation": "This change contradicts the requirement for a written amendment, stating that the Company can add products at its sole discretion, creating ambiguity about the process for adding licensed products. The final sentence reintroduces a degree of NFLA/NFLA-NC control, but only in terms of 'refusing endorsement,' not preventing addition of the product to the 'Licensed Products' definition.",

                "explanation": "By limiting the fixed per Unit conversion to only the first year and then stating it will be determined by the company's net profit margin after that, this change introduces ambiguity and potential conflict. The contract becomes inconsistent because the method of calculating donations changes mid-term without a clear mechanism for how the profit margin will influence the per unit conversion. This can lead to disputes over the actual donation amount.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the company will provide quarterly reports upon request. The modified version introduces several conflicting elements. First, it switches from actual quarterly reports to annual estimates which are inherently less accurate. Secondly, it makes access to the actual quarterly reports conditional upon a 'formal written request with documented just cause' and 'the Company's approval'. This contradicts the original agreement where no such restrictions existed. The new conditions create uncertainty regarding the NFLA-NC's ability to verify donation amounts, causing an enforcement issue.",

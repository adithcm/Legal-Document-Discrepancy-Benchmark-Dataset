The license under this Agreement is a non-exclusive, non-assignable and non-transferable license.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the license is non-assignable and non-transferable. The changed text makes it assignable and transferable with written notice to Party A, creating a contradiction. This could lead to disputes over whether Party B can sublicense or transfer the rights.",

During the term of this Agreement, Party A may terminate this Agreement only if Party B consents in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows Party A to terminate with 30 days written notice. The modified text requires Party B's written consent for Party A to terminate, creating a conflict on the conditions of termination. This contradiction can cause confusion during enforcement if Party A attempts to terminate the agreement without Party B's consent, potentially leading to litigation.",

Notices: Notices or other communications required to be given by any party pursuant to this Agreement shall be written in English and Chinese and delivered personally or sent by registered mail or postage prepaid mail or by a recognized courier service or by facsimile transmission to the address of relevant each party or both parties set forth below or other address of the party or of the other addressees specified by such party from time to time. The date when the notice is deemed to be duly served shall be determined as the follows: (a) a notice delivered personally is deemed duly served upon the delivery; (b) a notice sent by mail is deemed duly served the tenth (10th) day after the date when the air registered mail with postage prepaid has been sent out (as is shown on the postmark), or the fourth (4th) day after the delivery date to the internationally recognized courier service agency; and (c) a notice sent by facsimile transmission is deemed duly served upon the receipt time as is shown on the transmission confirmation of relevant documents.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires that notices be written in both English and Chinese, but the modified clause states that notices should only be written in English. Additionally, the time of service for fax transmission has been changed from receipt time to sending time. These contradictions can invalidate notices depending on which interpretation is followed. If the notice is given only in English (violating the original requirement), it could be challenged. Similarly, proving 'sending time' vs. 'receipt time' of a fax can be problematic.",

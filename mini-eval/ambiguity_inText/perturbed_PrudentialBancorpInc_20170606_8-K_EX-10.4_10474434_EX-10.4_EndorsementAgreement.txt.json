                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms will have the meanings set forth below:\n\n\"Base Salary\" means the Employee's total base salary as of each January 1st exclusive of special payments such as bonuses or commissions, but including any salary reductions made in accordance with Section 125 or 401(k) of the Code. For the purposes of calculating bonuses payable at the end of the calendar year, base salary will include any commissions earned throughout the year.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Base Salary' explicitly excludes commissions. The added sentence contradicts this by including commissions for bonus calculations, creating ambiguity regarding what constitutes base salary for certain purposes.",

The Employer will not take any action in dealing with the Insurer that would impair any right or interest of the Employee in the Policies. The Employer will have the right to borrow from the Insurer, and to secure that loan by the Policies an amount which together with the unpaid interest accrued thereon, will at no time exceed the lesser of (a) the Employer's Interest in the Policies and (b) the Loan Value of the Policies. During the Employee's life time \"The Employer's Interest In The Policies\" will mean, at any time at which the value of such interest is to be determined under this Agreement, the Cash Value of the Policies at such time, reduced by any then outstanding Policy Loan Balance with respect to any loans made or charged automatically against the Policies by the Employer.",

The Employer will not take any action in dealing with the Insurer that would impair any right or interest of the Employee in the Policies, unless required to do so by banking regulations. The Employer will have the right to borrow from the Insurer, and to secure that loan by the Policies an amount which together with the unpaid interest accrued thereon, will at no time exceed the lesser of (a) the Employer's Interest in the Policies and (b) the Loan Value of the Policies.

                "explanation": "The original text prevents the Employer from impairing the employee's rights. The added clause allows impairment if banking regulations require it. The omission of 'reduced by any then outstanding Policy Loan Balance with respect to any loans made or charged automatically against the Policies by the Employer' from the last sentence further increases ambiguity in calculating the Employer's Interest.",

The Employer shall be the beneficiary of the remaining death proceeds of the policy after the Employee's interest is determined.

                "explanation": "The added sentence introduces a new condition: if the employee is terminated for cause, the beneficiary receives only premiums paid by the Employee. This contradicts the original calculation method based on salary and Net Amount At Risk, leading to uncertainty about the beneficiary's entitlement upon termination 'for cause'. The extended deadline to 90 days adds potential delays.",

Reseller acknowledges and agrees that it does not have the right to assign sub-resellers under this Agreement  outside of the Territory, except with the prior written consent of Diversinet.",

Reseller acknowledges and agrees that it does have the right to assign sub-resellers under this Agreement  outside of the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Customers' is changed from those who 'will market and manage' the end-users to those 'in active discussions', broadening the scope. The statement about assigning sub-resellers is contradicted by removing the need for Diversinet's consent.",

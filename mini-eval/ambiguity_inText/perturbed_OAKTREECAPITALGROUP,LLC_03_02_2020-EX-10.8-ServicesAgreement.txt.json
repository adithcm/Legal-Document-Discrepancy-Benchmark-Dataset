                "original_text": "1.9 The Sub-Advisor shall act honestly, with due skill, care and diligence and fairly and in the best interest of the Partnership in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement and shall use all reasonable endeavours to perform its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with FSMA, the FCA Rules and any other laws, regulations, guidelines and guidance as may be in force from time to time and applicable to the Funds and their business or to the Sub-Advisor (\"Applicable Law\").",
                "changed_text": "1.9 The Sub-Advisor shall endeavor to act honestly and fairly in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with its understanding of FSMA, the FCA Rules and any other laws, regulations, guidelines and guidance as may be in force from time to time and applicable to the Funds and their business or to the Sub-Advisor (\"Applicable Law\").",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'due skill, care and diligence' and 'all reasonable endeavors' to comply with regulations. The modified text softens these requirements to 'endeavor to act honestly and fairly' and 'commercially reasonable efforts,' weakening the standard of care and creating a contradiction if other sections of the agreement rely on a higher standard of diligence.",

                "changed_text": "2.2 In connection with the appointment pursuant to Clause 2.1 but subject at all times to Clause 1:\n\n(a) Oaktree US hereby delegates to the Sub-Advisor such powers, authorities and discretions as Oaktree US deems appropriate to enable the Sub-Advisor to assist in its duties as sub-manager under this Agreement; and\n\n(b) The Sub-Advisor shall have the power and authority hereunder to recommend whether the Funds should acquire or dispose of an investment. Oaktree US retains final discretion, and the Sub-Advisor must consult with Oaktree US prior to:\n\n(i) making any significant investment decisions with respect to invested assets of the Funds; and\n\n(ii) entering into any investment documents or effecting any transactions (including, if applicable, instructing the Custodian (as defined in Clause 5.1 below) of the Funds in respect of transfers, withdrawals or receipts of money) that could materially impact the Funds' financial position.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the Sub-Advisor 'full power and authority' and 'discretion, without consultation' for investment decisions. The modified version limits this to 'recommending' investment decisions and requiring consultation with Oaktree US, thus contradicting the initial grant of full authority and creating uncertainty about the Sub-Advisor's actual decision-making power.",

                "changed_text": "10.2 Early Termination\n\nThis Agreement may be terminated, either in respect of a Fund or in its entirety, by either Oaktree US for any reason upon 30 days' written notice to the Sub-Advisor. The Sub-Advisor may only terminate this agreement due to a material breach by Oaktree US and with 90 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement permits both parties to terminate for any reason with 30 days' notice. The modified version allows Oaktree US to terminate for any reason with 30 days' notice, but restricts the Sub-Advisor's termination rights to situations of material breach and requires 90 days' notice. This creates a conflicting and unequal termination clause, disadvantaging the Sub-Advisor and creating ambiguity about the conditions under which the Sub-Advisor can exit the agreement.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion.

The Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee requires additional written approval from the Licensor, which may be unreasonably withheld.

                "explanation": "The original text grants the license for use of the Licensed Mark 'solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services'. The changed text introduces a conflicting requirement for 'additional written approval' for use in connection with the Licensed Services, creating ambiguity. This contradicts the initial grant, as it's now unclear whether the licensee has an automatic right to use the mark for Licensed Services.",

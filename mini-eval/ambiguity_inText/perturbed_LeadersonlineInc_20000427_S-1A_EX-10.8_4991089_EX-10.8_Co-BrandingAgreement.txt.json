                "original_text": "1.1.  Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a Party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Party.  For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting power of a Party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such Party.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.  Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a Party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Party.  For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least 25% of the outstanding voting power of a Party, or the right to control the day-to-day operations of such Party.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Affiliate' by changing the percentage of ownership required for 'control' from 50% to 25%. Additionally, controlling the policy decisions is changed to controlling the day-to-day operations, creating ambiguity as to when an entity qualifies as an affiliate.",

                "explanation": "This change broadens the definition of 'VerticalNet-LeadersOnline Clients.' The original definition requires clients to have made initial contact either through a link from VerticalNet or prompted by VerticalNet advertisements. The altered version removes this requirement, making any LeadersOnline client a 'VerticalNet-LeadersOnline Client.' If other parts of the contract are based on the original definition, there will be conflict.",

Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other Party in the event of any material breach of a term of this Agreement by such other Party that remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach was received by such other Party or, if the breach is not reasonably capable of cure within 30 days, such longer period, not to exceed 60 days, so long as the cure is commenced within the 30-day period and thereafter is diligently prosecuted to completion as soon as possible and in any event within 60 days.",
                "changed_text": "7.1.  Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other Party in the event of any breach of a term of this Agreement by such other Party that remains uncured 15 days after notice of such breach was received by such other Party or, if the breach is not reasonably capable of cure within 15 days, such longer period, not to exceed 30 days, so long as the cure is commenced within the 15-day period and thereafter is diligently prosecuted to completion as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days. For non-material breaches, a 60-day cure period will be provided.",
                "explanation": "The original contract defines termination conditions only for 'material' breaches with a 30-60 day cure period. The modified version now introduces 'any breach,' but dramatically shortens the cure period to 15-30 days. Then, it adds a clause for a 60-day cure period, but only for 'non-material' breaches. If another section defines a specific action as a material breach with a defined cure period, this change will create a conflict. It is now unclear what cure period applies when a material breach occurs.",

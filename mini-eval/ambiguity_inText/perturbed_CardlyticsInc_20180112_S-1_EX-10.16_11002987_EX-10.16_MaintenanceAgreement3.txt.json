Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in this Schedule, regardless of any definition in the SLCMA.",
                "explanation": "This creates an internal contradiction by stating that terms not defined in the Schedule are defined within the Schedule itself, superseding the definitions in the SLCMA. This contradicts the original text, which explicitly defers to the SLCMA for undefined capitalized terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the parties desire to add the Supplier Offer Placement System Software to the SLCMA. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the parties 'contemplate but do not guarantee' the inclusion. This contradicts the earlier statement, making it unclear whether the Offer Placement System Software is definitely part of the agreement.",

The modified text changes this to 'may be incorporated, subject to mutual agreement,' introducing uncertainty and a requirement for further documentation.

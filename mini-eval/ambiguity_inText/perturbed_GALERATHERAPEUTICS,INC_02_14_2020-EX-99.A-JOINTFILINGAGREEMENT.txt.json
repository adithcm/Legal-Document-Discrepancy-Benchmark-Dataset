                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for ensuring the filings are submitted; however, responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the information is shared among all parties making the filing, irrespective of individual knowledge or belief about the accuracy of others' information.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly delineates individual responsibility for the accuracy of their own information and limits responsibility for others' information to cases where knowledge of inaccuracy exists. The modified text contradicts this by stating that all parties share responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of all information, removing the knowledge threshold. This creates uncertainty about the extent of liability for inaccurate filings.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that revocation only affects the revoking party. The modified text contradicts this by stating that revocation terminates the agreement entirely upon notification to any one party, impacting all parties, not just the one revoking. This creates a conflict in understanding the mechanism and effect of revocation.",

                "explanation": "The original text indicates that all counterparts together form a single agreement. The modified text contradicts this by stating that only the first signed counterpart is definitive and legally binding. This creates ambiguity about which version of the agreement is enforceable if the counterparts differ.",

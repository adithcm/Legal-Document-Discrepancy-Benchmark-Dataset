The Trust agrees to sell to the Administrator those shares of the Funds which the Administrator orders on behalf of any Separate Account, executing such orders on a daily basis at the net asset value next computed after receipt and acceptance by the Fund or its designee of such order. Receipt by such designee shall constitute receipt by the Fund; provided that the Fund receives notice of such order via the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the \"NSCC\") by 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the next following Business Day. The Fund will receive all orders to purchase Fund shares using the NSCC's Defined Contribution Clearance & Settlement (\"DCC&S\") platform. The Fund will also provide the Administrator with account positions and activity data using the NSCC's Networking platform. The Administrator shall pay for Fund shares by the scheduled close of federal funds transmissions on the same Business Day it places an order to purchase Fund shares in accordance with this section using the NSCC's Fund/SERV System. Payment shall be in federal funds transmitted by wire from the Fund's designated Settling Bank to the NSCC. \"Business Day\" shall any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which the Fund calculates it net asset value pursuant to the rules of the SEC. \"Networking\" shall mean the NSCC's product that allows Fund's and Administrator to exchange account level information electronically. \"Settling Bank\" shall mean the entity appointed by the Fund to perform such settlement services on behalf of the Fund and agrees to abide by the NSCC's Rules and Procedures insofar as they relate to the same day funds settlement.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment timeline for Fund shares. The original text states that the Administrator must pay for Fund shares by the 'scheduled close of federal funds transmissions on the *same* Business Day' the order is placed, which implies immediate payment. The modified version states payment must be made *within two* Business Days. This creates ambiguity as to the exact payment deadline, which could lead to disputes over late payment penalties or contract breaches.",

This Agreement shall terminate (a) at the option of any party, upon 90 days' advance written notice to the other parties hereto; or (b) in the event of a material breach that has not been cured within ten days following a written notice of breach to the breaching party. The provisions of Sections 5, I l, 13 and 14 shall survive any termination of this agreement.",

The provisions of Sections 5, I l, 13 and 14 shall survive any termination of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for termination due to a material breach if not cured within *ten* days, whereas the modified text extends this cure period to *thirty* days. This creates a contradiction, as it's unclear which cure period applies. This inconsistency introduces uncertainty in contract enforcement related to material breaches and termination rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text in Section 14(i) states the Administrator will indemnify the Trust against trades that *are* cancelled due to late payments. The changed text uses the words 'may be cancelled,' effectively changing the provision from a mandatory indemnification trigger to one based on a potentiality. This weakens the obligation on the part of the Administrator. A separate section of the contract discussing order cancellation procedures likely assumes that indemnity is triggered *if* cancellation occurs, thus creating a direct contradiction about the conditions that require indemnification, leading to ambiguity.",

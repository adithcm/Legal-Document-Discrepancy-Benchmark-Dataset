                "explanation": "The modified definition of \"Intellectual Property\" now excludes 'customer lists and information' from the definition of 'Know-How,' which is a subset of 'Intellectual Property.' This contradicts the original definition, as 'customer lists and information' were explicitly included in the original definition of Know-How. This change could lead to disputes over whether customer data is protected as intellectual property under the agreement, particularly in sections dealing with licensing or confidentiality.",

RemainCo shall have the right to use the SpinCo House Marks in connection with the operation of the RemainCo Business for a limited period of 270 days following the Distribution Date. After such 270-day period, RemainCo shall discontinue all use of the SpinCo House Marks, including any use on stationery or letterhead and any use on or in connection with other RemainCo Assets. However, the Parties agree that the RemainCo Group may continue, beyond such 270-day period, to distribute copies of any existing inventory of its marketing literature, including technical papers, brochures, and printed promotional material, in existence on the Distribution Date, provided, however, that reasonable efforts are made to remove or cover up any SpinCo House Marks appearing thereon prior to distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2, in no event shall any of the members of the RemainCo Group continue to use the SpinCo House Marks (whether in any of the materials referenced in the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise) following a Change of Control of RemainCo. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the foregoing shall apply to any stationery, letterhead or marketing literature, including technical papers, brochures, and printed promotional material, distributed by any member of the RemainCo Group to its customers prior to the Distribution Date or to any SpinCo House Marks included on or in any copies of the Steam Book distributed by RemainCo or any member of the RemainCo Group prior to or after the Distribution Date. All of RemainCo's use of the SpinCo House Marks shall inure to the benefit of SpinCo. RemainCo agrees to use the SpinCo House Marks in accordance with such quality standards as are used by the SpinCo Group as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Section 3.2, it is expressly agreed that RemainCo is not obtaining any right, title or interest in the SpinCo House Marks.",

                "explanation": "The modified Section 3.2 introduces a contradiction by stating that RemainCo should discontinue all *active* use, but then removes the obligation to remove or cover up the SpinCo House Marks on existing marketing materials. This conflicts with the initial discontinuation requirement because distributing these materials effectively means there is a continued use of the SpinCo House Marks after 270 days, which would be a contradiction if active use is not defined. The amendment removes the 'reasonable efforts' requirement, making the situation even more unclear.",

This sets a standard. The modified version removes both the 'reasonable efforts' standard and the requirement of consistency, allowing each party to maintain confidentiality as they 'deem necessary.' This could be interpreted as allowing minimal or no effort at all, conflicting with the implicit expectation elsewhere in the agreement that the Shared Library Materials are valuable and should be protected. This provides very broad discretion over how confidentiality is maintained.",

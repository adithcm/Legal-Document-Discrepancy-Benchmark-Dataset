                "explanation": "Section 8(B) redefines 'Term' specifically for content usage as the *longer* of two periods related to content delivery and the licensor agreement. This directly contradicts section 8(A). Also, the duration parameters are changed to 'shorter of', 'one year' and 'half the duration'.

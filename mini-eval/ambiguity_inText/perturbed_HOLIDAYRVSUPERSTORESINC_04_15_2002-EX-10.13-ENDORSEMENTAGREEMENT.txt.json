AGI hereby grants a non-exclusive license (the \"License\") to the Company and its operating subsidiaries now or hereafter existing to use the Good Sam name and logo, including trademarks, trade names, or service marks as designated by AGI (the \"Trademarks\"), in connection with the sale of such new and used vehicles by the Company that have satisfied such criteria and standards as are established from time to time by AGI (the \"Approved Use\"). AGI warrants that it has the right and ability to grant the License to the Company to use the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant will not infringe upon the rights of any other party. If the Company promptly notifies AGI in writing of a third party claim against the Company alleging that the Company's use of the Trademarks infringes a United States registered trademark, and if such claim of infringement is not caused in whole or in part by the Company having used the Trademarks other than for the Approved Use or other than strictly in the manner approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this",

The changed text contradicts this by removing the requirement for vehicles to meet any specific criteria or standards, creating ambiguity about the scope of the license.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that a 'material breach' is required for termination. The modified version removes the word 'material,' implying that any breach, even a minor one, could lead to termination. This is a contradiction, as the standard understanding of contract law usually requires materiality for termination clauses to be enforceable and introduces uncertainty about the threshold for acceptable behavior.",

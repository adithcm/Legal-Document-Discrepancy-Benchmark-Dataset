                "original_text": "D. Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within thirty (30) days of the Invoice date shall be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of 1.0% per month which is a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 12% on the outstanding balance.",
                "changed_text": "D. Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within thirty (30) days of the Invoice date shall be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of 1.0% per month which is a corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 12% on the outstanding balance. However, PCQ may, at its sole discretion, waive this finance charge for the first instance of late payment.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a mandatory finance charge for late payments. The modified text introduces an exception, allowing PCQ to waive the charge at its discretion. This creates a contradiction as it's unclear when the finance charge is actually applicable, potentially leading to disputes over payment terms.",

In the absence of a mutually agreed upon disclaimer, the standard industry disclaimer, as determined by ABW, shall be used.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific disclaimer that ABW must include. The modified text introduces a requirement for both parties to agree on the disclaimer quarterly, and if they fail to agree, ABW uses a 'standard industry disclaimer'. This contradicts the original fixed disclaimer, creating uncertainty over what disclaimers are actually valid and enforceable, particularly if ABW chooses a disclaimer that is less protective of PCQ.",

However, PCQ's failure to provide the HYPERFEED as outlined in Section 1A will not be considered a material breach unless the interruption lasts for more than 72 hours continuously.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that any material breach allows for termination after a 30-day cure period. The modified text adds a specific exception for PCQ's HYPERFEED failure, stating it's only a material breach if the interruption lasts for more than 72 hours. This creates a contradiction: a failure to provide HYPERFEED *could* be a material breach under the general clause, but *isn't* under the specific exception unless it exceeds the 72-hour threshold. This could lead to disputes over whether a shorter interruption constitutes a breach.",

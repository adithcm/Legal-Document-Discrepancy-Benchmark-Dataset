                "explanation": "The modification changes the payment timeframe from thirty (45) days to thirty (60) days.

The Supplier shall provide a copy of the insurance policy to the Distributor only if legally required.",
                "explanation": "The change modifies when the Supplier is required to provide the distributor with the insurance policy.  The original text gives the Distributor the right to see the policy upon request. The changed version limits this right and makes it conditional to legal requirements, which introduces conflict and makes it hard to check insurance policy when needed.",

                "explanation": "Here, the notice period needed to terminate the agreement after the initial term is changed from twelve months to six (12) months (ambiguous). This creates conflict and uncertainty about the required period for termination. The 'six' introduces a lower number that is contradictory to the '12' enclosed by parentheses, as either party could argue that the intended notice period was actually six months, not twelve.",

                "original_text": "Intellectual Property (as defined below); WHEREAS, as part of the Purchaser's acquisition of the Business, the Seller intends to assign to the Purchaser Assignees certain of such Intellectual Property and to license the Purchaser Licensees to use certain of such Intellectual Property, in each case pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein; and WHEREAS, as part of such acquisition, the Purchaser Assignees and Acquired Companies intend to license the Seller Parties to use certain of such assigned Intellectual Property and certain other Intellectual Property owned by the Acquired Companies.",
                "changed_text": "Intellectual Property (as defined below); WHEREAS, as part of the Purchaser's acquisition of the Business, the Seller intends to assign to the Purchaser Assignees certain of such Intellectual Property, subject to further negotiation and approval; and WHEREAS, as part of such acquisition, the Purchaser Assignees and Acquired Companies intend to license the Seller Parties to use certain of such assigned Intellectual Property and certain other Intellectual Property owned by the Acquired Companies. This agreement does not guarantee that all Intellectual Property will be assigned as initially intended.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the intention to assign Intellectual Property. The modified text introduces uncertainty by suggesting that the assignment is subject to further negotiation and approval, implying that not all Intellectual Property may be assigned as initially understood. This creates a conflict in how the agreement is interpreted regarding the definitiveness of the assignment.",

                "changed_text": "(xxx) \"Purchaser Licensees\" means certain Affiliates of the Purchaser, to be specifically designated in writing by the Purchaser to the Seller within thirty (30) days of the Initial Closing Date. If no such designation is made, no entities shall be considered Purchaser Licensees.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Purchaser Licensees\" is broad and inclusive of all current and future Affiliates. The modified definition restricts it to only those Affiliates specifically designated in writing, potentially excluding some Affiliates. The uncertainty around who exactly qualifies as a “Purchaser Licensee” creates an internal contradiction that affects the scope and enforceability of the licenses granted.",

It is recommended that they protect the confidentiality thereof using at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own similar confidentiality or proprietary information.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a specific level of care for protecting confidential information. The modified version suggests a discretionary approach, weakening the obligation and introducing a contradiction. The word shall has been changed to may allow to and recommend, so it may affect its enforceability.",

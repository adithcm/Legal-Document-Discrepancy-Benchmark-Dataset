Subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein, as of the date of this agreement, LEADER shall maintain the software for an additional five years, provided EZJR continues to meet its financial obligations as outlined in a separate agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states LEADER will maintain the software for five years. The modified clause adds a condition ('provided EZJR continues to meet its financial obligations') that wasn't explicitly mentioned, making the maintenance obligation conditional. This contradicts the unconditional nature of the original statement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows the prevailing party to recover 'reasonable attorney's fees'. The modified version caps the recoverable fees at $5,000.

The modified clause adds a restriction on Leader's ability to assign its obligations, requiring express written consent from EZJR.

                "original_text": "1. Definitions. Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Amendment will have the meaning set forth for that term in the Non-Competition Agreement or the Master Framework Agreement, dated September 30, 2016, by and between the Parties (the \"Master Framework Agreement\").",
                "changed_text": "1. Definitions. Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Amendment will have the meaning set forth for that term in the Non-Competition Agreement. For terms defined in the Master Framework Agreement, dated September 30, 2016, by and between the Parties (the \"Master Framework Agreement\"), such definitions will be considered, but not necessarily controlling, and may be subject to alternative interpretation based on the context of this Amendment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the definition of capitalized terms. Initially, terms not defined in the amendment directly inherit the definitions from the Non-Competition or Master Framework Agreement. The modification states that the Master Framework Agreement definitions are only 'considered' and are subject to 'alternative interpretation'. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes, since the same capitalized term may have different meanings in different sections of the contract.",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the \"Sales Term\" as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the \"Term\").\"",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the agreement's term is tied to the 'Sales Term' defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement. By replacing this with a fixed five-year period, we introduce a contradiction if the Sales Dealer Agreement has a different term length. This creates uncertainty regarding the non-solicitation obligations' duration, leading to enforcement issues.",

                "changed_text": "5. Master Framework Agreement. This Amendment is governed by the Master Framework Agreement, specifically the provisions of Section 4 (Confidentiality) of the Master Framework Agreement. Other provisions of the Master Framework Agreement, including but not limited to Section 6 (Miscellaneous) shall not be applicable to this Amendment.",
                "explanation": "Initially, both Sections 4 and 6 of the Master Framework Agreement are said to govern the amendment. The change limits this to only Section 4, explicitly excluding Section 6. This is contradictory because it implies that certain miscellaneous provisions that might typically apply to amendments, such as governing law or dispute resolution, are now not applicable, creating confusion about how the amendment is to be interpreted and enforced.",

However, with respect to AbbVie's obligations under Section 4.2, 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' means the dedication of at least 5 full-time employees and an annual marketing budget of no less than $1,000,000.",
                "explanation": "In the original definition, 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' has the meaning redacted as [***]. However, the modified definition first introduces a standard definition, and then introduces a conflicting metric for AbbVie's obligations under Section 4.2, by setting a minimum number of employees and budget. This creates uncertainty as to how compliance with 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' is measured.",

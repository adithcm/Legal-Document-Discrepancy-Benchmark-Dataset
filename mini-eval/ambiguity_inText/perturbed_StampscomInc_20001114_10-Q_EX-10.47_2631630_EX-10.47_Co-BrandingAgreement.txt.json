                "original_text": "     (p) \"MBE Center\" shall mean each franchise of MBE operating a franchise           ---------- retail outlet within the United States which enters into a Subscription Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "     (p) \"MBE Center\" shall mean each franchise of MBE operating a franchise           ---------- retail outlet within the United States which enters into a Subscription Agreement.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of Section 8 (Payments; Taxes), \"MBE Center\" shall also include any temporary kiosk or pop-up location operated under the MBE brand, regardless of whether a Subscription Agreement is in place.",
                "explanation": "The first definition restricts 'MBE Center' to franchises with Subscription Agreements. The second definition in Section 1(p) broadens this to include temporary locations even without such agreements. This creates ambiguity regarding payment obligations for these non-traditional locations under Section 8.",

Any modifications to Exhibit D require written consent from both parties, explicitly referencing this section. \n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may unilaterally update pricing information within the Specifications as needed to reflect current market rates, without prior notice or formal amendment.",
                "explanation": "The first definition states that Specifications are updated as needed. The modified definition in Section 1(u) then requires written consent for modifications, but allows unilateral updates for pricing. This creates a contradiction: are pricing updates 'modifications' requiring consent, or are they exempt? This impacts MBE's ability to contest pricing changes.",

The Company will make Updates to the          ----------------------------- Service in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Specifications at no charge for the initial term of this Agreement. \n\nHowever, for any Renewal Period, the Company reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee for major Updates that involve significant new functionality, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. MBE will be notified of such fees in advance.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Updates are free for the entire agreement term. The modified definition in Section 4(a) contradicts this by allowing charges for major Updates during renewal periods. This introduces ambiguity: does 'the entire term' include renewal periods, and what constitutes a 'major' update?",

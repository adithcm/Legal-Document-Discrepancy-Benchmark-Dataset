                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'best efforts' and exclusive processing through Network 1. The modified text weakens the 'best efforts' standard to 'commercially reasonable efforts' and allows Contractors to process transactions through other providers, conflicting with the exclusivity clause. This creates uncertainty about the level of effort required from the Affiliate and the exclusivity of the contractor relationship.",

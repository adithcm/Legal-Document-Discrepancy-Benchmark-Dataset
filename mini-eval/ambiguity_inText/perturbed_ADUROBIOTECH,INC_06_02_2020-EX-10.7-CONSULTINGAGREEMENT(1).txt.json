Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time on prior written notice to the other. This Agreement may be extended upon mutual written agreement of the parties.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time on thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other. This Agreement may only be extended upon unanimous written agreement of all the parties involved and if a conflict arises the company's decision will be final.",
                "explanation": "The original states termination can occur with prior written notice without specifying a duration. The modified text introduces a 30-day notice period, creating a contradiction as to the immediate termination clause and creates ambiguity regarding the agreement extension condition.",

Aduro shall be entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto.

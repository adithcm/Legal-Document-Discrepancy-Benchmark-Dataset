                "changed_text": "      \"ABOUT CUSTOMER\" means any individual or entity who has registered with       ebix through the registration process on the Insurance Center, and actively maintains an insurance policy purchased through ebix for a minimum of six months.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'ABOUT CUSTOMER' includes anyone who registers with ebix through the Insurance Center or via a link from the About Network. The modified definition limits this to individuals who not only register but also maintain an active insurance policy for at least six months. This creates a conflict because someone registering without maintaining a policy would be an 'ABOUT CUSTOMER' under the original definition but not under the modified one. This could affect data ownership and usage rights related to those users.",

                "explanation": "The original definition encompasses a broad range of non-public information, including 'user data and site usage data.' The modified version explicitly excludes 'user data and site usage data' from the definition of 'CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION'. This introduces a direct contradiction and uncertainty regarding the protection of user data. One section treats user data as confidential, whereas the other states explicitly that it is not.",

In the event of any downtime and/or maintenance in excess of the aforementioned amount, such shall be deemed a material breach and ebix shall have twenty four (24) hours in which to cure such breach. If such breach is not cured to About's reasonable satisfaction, About may remove the ebix Links after informing either the President, CFO or CTO of ebix until About reasonably determines that the ebix Web Site is operational and fully functional.",

Downtime for scheduled maintenance is permitted at ebix's discretion, but ebix shall use its best efforts to minimize disruption. In the event of any downtime, About will be notified promptly.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a strict uptime requirement with a limited allowance for scheduled downtime, and any excess downtime constitutes a material breach. The modified clause removes the limitation on scheduled downtime and eliminates the 'material breach' consequence. Instead, it imposes a 'best efforts' standard, which is less stringent and more ambiguous than a fixed uptime percentage. This creates a conflict regarding the operational obligations of Ebix, because the original clause imposes strict liability, and the modified one imposes a negligence-like approach.",

The modified definition introduces the Master Batch Record as a secondary source of product description but then says Exhibit A will prevail which contradict the function of Master Batch Record in case of confliction.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the Supplier *shall* Manufacture the product. The modified text weakens this to \"shall use reasonable efforts.\" This introduces ambiguity. If Supplier does not meet the standards, it's unclear whether they are in breach, since they only have to use 'reasonable efforts'. The original text's strict standard is contradicted by the looser \"reasonable efforts\" standard, especially if another section enforces strict manufacturing. Besides 'Manufactured in accordance' will be perturbed to 'Manufactured generally in accordance' to add more flexibilities. ",

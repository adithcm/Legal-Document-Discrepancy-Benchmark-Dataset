                "explanation": "The change from 'AIG shall' to 'AIG may' introduces a contradiction regarding AIG's obligation to make capital contributions. Previously, it was mandatory if certain conditions were met. Now, it's discretionary even when those conditions are met, creating uncertainty.",

(\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Notwithstanding the obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand, and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'shall be agreed to by AIG and the Company' to 'may be adjusted unilaterally by AIG' introduces a conflict regarding who determines the Specified Minimum Percentage. The initial wording implied a mutual agreement, but the modified text allows AIG to change it alone. This directly contradicts the later clause about mutual agreement to review, generating ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The added clause contradicts the initial waiver. The original text states AIG waives any failure to enforce rights, whereas the addition allows them to dispute claims based on merit, even if they previously failed to act on those rights. This ambiguity creates confusion about the extent of AIG's waiver.",

An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it controls, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Act' now refers to the Companies Act, 2013 while other sections might still refer to compliances required under the Companies Act, 1956. This creates a contradiction as the 1956 Act is no longer valid, but obligations under it may still be referenced elsewhere, causing confusion about which law governs specific requirements. This makes clear enforcement uncertain.",

Provided that if an MIL/MINDA or an IMPCO Director fails to be present for two consecutive meetings of the Board as a result of which a meeting of the Board 9 cannot be held for want of quorum, then either the three IMPCO or the two MIL/MINDA Directors shall constitute the requisite quorum.",

                "explanation": "The original definition explicitly requires that at least one MIL/MINDA Director and one IMPCO Director be present for a quorum. The modified version removes this explicit requirement. If other sections assume that a MIL/MINDA and IMPCO director *must* be present, this contradiction creates ambiguity and uncertain enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The addition of \"unless it is beneficial to the JVC\" introduces a subjective element to the restriction on IMPCO, while the restriction on MIL/MINDA remains absolute for a period. If 'beneficial' is not well-defined in other sections, it creates a contradiction: Is IMPCO free to pursue potentially conflicting ventures if they believe it benefits the JVC, even if it directly competes with the JV?",

For the Initial Term of this Agreement, iVillage agrees that Ford shall be the exclusive automobile manufacturer sponsor and advertiser throughout the Network, with respect to entities whose primary business is that of an automotive manufacturer and/or retailer. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"retailer\" shall refer to an entity which sells new and/or used vehicles. In addition, in the event that iVillage desires to form a sponsorship relationship with an automobile rental company during the term of this Agreement, iVillage shall notify Hertz and provide Hertz with an opportunity to enter into such a relationship with iVillage, on not less favorable terms than those offered to any other automobile rental company. Once presented with an opportunity, Hertz shall have five (5) business days in which to accept or reject such terms. If iVillage does not receive Hertz's acceptance or rejection of such within the allotted time, iVillage shall deem Hertz's silence as rejection. The terms of any such relationship shall be mutually determined by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FMC shall, on a non-exclusive basis, 3 be permitted to offer Ford Motor Credit car financing products related to the purchase of Ford vehicles.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'retailer' included entities selling both new and used vehicles. The modified version restricts the definition to only entities selling new vehicles. This creates ambiguity because it's unclear whether iVillage is allowed to have sponsorship relationships with used car dealerships, as they are now excluded from the definition of retailer within this section.",

It is expected that, pursuant to discussions to date and to this Agreement, the Parties may disclose to one another certain information (\"Confidential Information\"), as defined herein, which is considered by the disclosing Party to be proprietary or confidential information. Confidential Information is defined as any, information, communication or data, in any form, including, but not limited to oral, written, graphic or electromagnetic forms, models or samples, which the disclosing Party desires to protect against unrestricted disclosure or use, including without limitation, business information, financial data and marketing data. All Confidential Information shall remain the sole property, of the disclosing Party and its confidentiality shall be maintained and protected by the receiving Party with the same degree of care as the receiving Party uses for its own confidential and proprietary information and the receiving Party shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party. The restrictions of the use or disclosure of any Confidential Information shall not apply to any Confidential Information: (i) after it has become generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party; (ii) is rightfully in the receiving Party's possession prior to disclosure to it by the disclosing Party; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving Party; (iv) is rightfully received by the receiving Party from a third party, without a duty of confidentiality; or (v) is required to be disclosed under operation of law.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' includes a broad range of information in various forms. The modified version drastically restricts this definition to only information verbally designated as confidential at the time of disclosure. This contradiction means that information shared in writing or through other means would not be protected, creating potential disputes over what constitutes confidential information under the agreement.",

A. iVillage agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless FMM and its client Ford Motor Company and their respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns from any and all third party losses, liabilities, damages, actions, claims, expenses and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) which result or arise out of or in connection with the breach of this 5 Agreement by iVillage or which result or arise out of or in connection with any material supplied by iVillage pursuant to this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Section 12A originally stated iVillage would indemnify for *any* breach. The modification says iVillage only indemnifies for *gross negligence*. This is a contradiction because section 12B says FMM must indemnify iVillage for *any* breach. This creates uncertainty on the level of negligence required for indemnification depending on which party breaches.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx\" refers to 'total actual number' derived from 'Prescriber Data'. The modified definition uses 'estimated number' derived from 'initial marketing projections.' The original definition of “Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx Tablets” uses data from IMS NPA. The updated definition states ‘maximum number’ derived from internal forecasts. This creates a discrepancy about how prescriptions are counted and what data is the source of truth. The definition of Change of Control in part A of the definition is also conflicted by changing 50% ownership to 60% ownership.",

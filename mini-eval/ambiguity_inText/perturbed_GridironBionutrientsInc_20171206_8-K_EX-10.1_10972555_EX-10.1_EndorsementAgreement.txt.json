                "original_text": "A. \"Contract Period\" shall mean that period of time of three (3) years commencing on November 1st, 2017 and concluding November 2nd, 2020, unless terminated sooner or extended as provided in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "A. \"Contract Period\" shall mean that period of time of three (3) years commencing on November 1st, 2017 and concluding November 2nd, 2020, unless terminated sooner as provided in this Agreement. The Contract Period may be extended indefinitely by mutual verbal agreement between the parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a three-year contract period with specific start and end dates, only allowing for termination or extension as provided *in the agreement*. The modified text introduces a conflicting possibility of *verbal* indefinite extension. This creates ambiguity because the written contract states a fixed term, while a separate clause allows an unwritten agreement to override that term. This makes the actual duration of the contract uncertain and creates a contradiction.",

A Licensed Product in no circumstance shall be valued at less than one (1) full Unit and under no circumstance shall a Unit be fractionalized (if required rounded up to the nearest whole number). However, for promotional periods, the Company reserves the right to define a Unit as $0.025 for specific products, provided the NFLA-NC is notified in writing 30 days prior.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines \"One (1) Unit\" as strictly $0.05 and explicitly forbids fractionalizing it or valuing a licensed product at less than one full unit. The modified text then introduces an exception allowing the Company to devalue the unit during promotional periods under certain notification terms. This creates a contradiction because the first definition implies a fixed value, while the added sentence allows for a variable, lower value. This directly impacts the donation amount to the NFLA-NC and makes the calculation of remuneration ambiguous.",

If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall: (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money specified in this Agreement to be made; or (ii) fail to observe or perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations under this Agreement (other than the payment of money), the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: As to a default under clause (i) above, if such payment is not made within 10 business days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment; or, as to a default under clause (ii) above, if such other default is not cured within 30 days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default. In order to be a sufficient notice under this section, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default and shall specify the provision of this Agreement which applies to each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party is required to take in order to cure each item of default. The termination rights set forth in this section shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the non-defaulting party under this Agreement, however, and if default is made by either party under this Agreement, the other party may resort to such other remedies as such party would have been entitled to if this section had been omitted from this Agreement, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Termination under the provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims which the terminating party may otherwise have against the defaulting party, and if Company is the defaulting party, Company shall be responsible for any and all payments due under the terms of this Agreement in addition to other liabilities set forth above.",

                "explanation": "The original section outlines specific conditions and timelines for termination due to payment failure or breach of contract. It specifies cure periods of 10 or 30 days after written notice. The modified version introduces a contradictory clause that mandates a 30-day mediation period *prior* to any termination, regardless of the established cure periods. This creates ambiguity. Does the 30-day mediation run concurrently with the existing cure period, or does it extend the time to cure before termination can occur? This internal contradiction complicates the termination process.",

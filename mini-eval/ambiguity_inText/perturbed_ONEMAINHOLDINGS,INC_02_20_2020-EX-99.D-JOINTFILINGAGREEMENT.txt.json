                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D. Any further amendments thereto are subject to individual review and approval by each undersigned party, and specific written consent is required for each amendment to be included in the joint filing. Without explicit written consent from all parties, amendments are not covered under this joint filing agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states agreement to 'any and all further amendments.' The modified text introduces a requirement for individual review, approval, and written consent for each amendment, contradicting the initial blanket agreement. This creates ambiguity regarding the scope of the joint filing agreement.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts. While each counterpart will bear original signatures, for legal enforcement, the *master* signed copy retained by Värde Partners, Inc. will be the legally binding document, and all other counterparts are considered copies for informational purposes only.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states each counterpart is an original. The modification states only the copy held by Värde Partners, Inc. is legally binding, contradicting the original's intent and creating confusion about which version controls in a dispute.",

Should a signatory sign after March 1, 2020, their participation in the joint filing will pertain only to filings made after their signature date.",
                "explanation": "The original indicates a single effective date. The modified text introduces potentially different effective dates for each signatory and limits participation based on signature date. This contradicts the initial agreement on a unified effective date and adds uncertainty about which filings each party is jointly responsible for.",

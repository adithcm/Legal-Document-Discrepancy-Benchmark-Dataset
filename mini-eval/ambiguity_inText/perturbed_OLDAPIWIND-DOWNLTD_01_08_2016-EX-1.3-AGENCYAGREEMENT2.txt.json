                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that terms generally follow the Agency Agreement, but the definition of 'Accredited Investor' within the certificate overrides any conflicting definition. If the Agency Agreement or Schedule A defines 'Accredited Investor' differently than Section (iii) of the certificate, it creates ambiguity as to which definition is legally binding, potentially impacting the validity of sales to investors.",

                "changed_text": "(iii) immediately prior to offering the Securities to persons in the United States, we had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe that each such person was an Accredited Investor. For the purposes of this agreement, an Accredited Investor is defined solely as an individual with a pre-existing business relationship with the Agent. Regardless of other legal definitions of Accredited Investors, this narrower definition shall be used for all transactions under this certificate; and, on the date hereof, we continue to believe that each such offeree purchasing Securities from the Corporation is an Accredited Investor;",
                "explanation": "This change provides a more restrictive and potentially contradictory definition of 'Accredited Investor'. The text emphasizes a 'pre-existing business relationship' as the sole criteria, potentially conflicting with the broader definition of 'Accredited Investor' typically used under U.S. Securities laws and perhaps as defined elsewhere in the Agency Agreement or Schedule A. This narrowing and clarification against potential outside definitions opens the door to potential misinterpretation.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses the phrase \"is subject to any Disqualification Event\", whereas the revised text uses \"*is believed to be* subject to any Disqualification Event\". This subtle change weakens the warranty and introduces ambiguity. In the original text, the Agent provides an explicit warranty. With the change, the agent is now providing a warrant that is based on their current beliefs, reducing liability for the firm.",

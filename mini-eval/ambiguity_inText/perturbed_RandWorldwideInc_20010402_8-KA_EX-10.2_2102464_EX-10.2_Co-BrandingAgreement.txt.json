                "explanation": "This change adds conditions to the revenue sharing percentages. In (a), it limits the apportionment to customers acquired through Dassault Systemes' marketing, potentially excluding customers who found the service independently.

It makes the revenue sharing calculation very confusing.",

In such a case, the breaching party will only be liable for actual and direct damages; consequential damages are explicitly waived.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly restricts the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated. The original clause allows termination for any material breach, whereas the modified clause limits it to breaches of Section 3. The added limitation of liability also contradicts the original clause by disallowing consequential damages, altering the remedies available to the non-breaching party. This introduces significant legal ambiguities regarding breach remedies and termination rights.",

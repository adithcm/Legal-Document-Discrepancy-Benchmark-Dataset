In the event Contractor anticipates at any time that it will not deliver Products within the prescribed timetable as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order, Contractor shall promptly so inform Customer by written notice of such delay. Contractor shall submit proposed revisions to the timetable that reflect Contractor's best estimates of what can realistically be achieved and shall use its best commercial efforts to achieve such timeline, unless otherwise directed by Customer and confirmed by Contractor.",

                "explanation": "The original definition stated that 'Warranty Period' shall mean twelve (12) months, while the changed definition modifies it to six (6) months. In addition, it also contradicts the type of material, by introducing 'refurbished' instead of only 'new'.",

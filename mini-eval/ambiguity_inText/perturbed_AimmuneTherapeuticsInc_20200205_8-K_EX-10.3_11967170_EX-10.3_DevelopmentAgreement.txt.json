                "original_text": "1.21 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective (e.g., Development Activities and Commercialization hereunder), the level of efforts consistent with the efforts and resources [***] of similar market potential, at a similar stage in development or product lifecycle, taking into account the stage of development or product lifecycle of other of [***] product candidates, safety and efficacy, product profile, cost of goods, the competitiveness of the marketplace, such company's patent position with respect to such product (including such company's ability to obtain or enforce, or have obtained or enforced, such patent rights), the Third Party patent landscape relevant to the product, the regulatory structure involved, the likelihood of regulatory approval, the likelihood and extent of anticipated or actual profitability of the applicable product, and other technical, legal, scientific and medical considerations. Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",
                "changed_text": "1.21 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective (e.g., Development Activities and Commercialization hereunder), the minimal efforts required and the reasonable allocation of resources, taking into account only the immediate financial gains of such party without considering long-term market potential, competitive landscape, or other technical, legal, scientific and medical considerations. For the avoidance of doubt, Commercially Reasonable Efforts does NOT require, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a conflicting definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts.' The original text includes a broad range of factors to consider, while the modified text limits the scope to immediate financial gains and removes the specific requirements for assigning responsibility and allocating resources. This creates uncertainty regarding the level of effort required.",

                "explanation": "The term Regulatory Approval is initially defined to INCLUDE pricing approvals but then redefined to EXCLUDE them. This contradiction introduces ambiguity as some sections may treat pricing approvals as essential while others might not, leading to conflicting interpretations of the contract's requirements.",

Originally it encompasses all aspects of creating the product after receipt of the active ingredients. The modified definition limits it to only receiving, handling, storing, and shipping, with all other steps categorized as Development Activities. This could lead to conflict over responsibility and financial obligations tied to each activity.",

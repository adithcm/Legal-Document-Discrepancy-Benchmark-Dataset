                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.7 \"Products\" shall mean the products offered by JRVS for sale to the Distributor; the Products shall include iMine cryptocurrency mining rigs and its parts and components.",
                "changed_text": "1.7 \"Products\" shall mean the products offered by JRVS for sale to the Distributor; the Products shall include iMine cryptocurrency mining rigs. Parts and components are not included unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding what constitutes 'Products'. Initially, it includes rigs, parts and components. The modified version excludes parts and components unless otherwise agreed, potentially causing confusion about what the Distributor is authorized to sell and what warranties apply to.",

The Distributor shall have thirty (30) days (the \"Inspection Period\") upon receipt of each shipment to inspect and test the Products. If the Distributor determines any unit of Products defective, the Distributor shall promptly notify JRVS of such defects. Defective Products may be returned for retest, evaluation and examination subject to JRVS Returned Material Authorization (\"RMA\") procedure; provided, that such written notification and request for an RMA number must be received by JRVS during the Inspection Period.",
                "changed_text": "7.2 Inspection and Acceptance. The Distributor shall have ten (10) days (the \"Inspection Period\") upon receipt of each shipment to inspect and test the Products. If the Distributor determines any unit of Products defective, the Distributor may, at JRVS's sole discretion, notify JRVS of such defects. Defective Products may be returned for retest, evaluation and examination subject to JRVS Returned Material Authorization (\"RMA\") procedure; provided, that such written notification and request for an RMA number must be received by JRVS during the Inspection Period.",
                "explanation": "The change creates a contradiction. Originally the distributor has 'shall' 30 days inspection period. The new text changes the inspection period to 10 days and changes 'shall promptly notify' to 'may, at JRVS's sole discretion, notify', making the process of handling defective items ambiguous. This creates uncertainty as to what happens when the products are defective.",

This Agreement may be terminated by JRVS for any reason or no reason, whether or not extended beyond the initial term, by giving the other party written notice ninety (90) days in advance. The Distributor may terminate this agreement only if JRVS is in material breach.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency by creating unequal termination rights. Initially, both parties could terminate for any reason with 90 days notice. Now, JRVS can still terminate for any reason, but the Distributor can only terminate if JRVS is in material breach. This creates unequal obligations, leading to potential disputes.",

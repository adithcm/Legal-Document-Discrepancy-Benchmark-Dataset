In the event the Agent incurs any such fees and expenses on behalf of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank, the Bank will reimburse the Agent for such fees and expenses whether or not the Offerings are consummated; provided, however, that the Agent shall not incur any substantial expenses on behalf of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank pursuant to this Section without the prior approval of the Bank.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will pay all expenses related to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement, as deemed reasonable. This includes the cost of obtaining securities and regulatory approvals, preparation of the registration statement, issuance of securities certificates, and fees for counsel and accountants. However, any fees or expenses of the MHC's and the Bank's counsel, conversion agent, appraiser and other advisors are the sole responsibility of the individual parties, and not reimbursable under this agreement. In the event the Agent incurs any such fees and expenses on behalf of the Company, the Company will reimburse the Agent for such fees and expenses only if the Offerings are successfully consummated.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Company, MHCs, and Bank jointly pay all expenses, but the modified text shifts some of those expenses to the individual parties and makes the Agent reimbursement contingent upon the success of the offering. This creates conflicting terms about which parties are responsible for which expenses and when reimbursement occurs.",

On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Sandler O'Neill accepts such appointment and agrees to use its best efforts to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with any applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders. The services to be rendered by Sandler O'Neill pursuant to this appointment include the following: (i) consulting as to the securities marketing implications of any aspect of the Plans or related corporate documents; (ii) reviewing with the Board of Directors of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank financial and securities marketing implications of the Appraiser's appraisal of the Common Stock; (iii) reviewing all offering documents, including the Prospectus, stock order forms and related offering materials (it being understood that preparation and filing of such documents is the sole responsibility of the Company and the Bank and their counsel); (iv) assisting in the design and implementation of a marketing strategy for the Offerings; (v) assisting management of the Company and the Bank in preparing for meetings with potential investors and broker-dealers; and (vi) providing such other general advice and assistance regarding financial and marketing aspects of the Offering as may be requested to promote the successful completion of the Offering.",
                "changed_text": "The Company appoints Sandler O'Neill as its Agent to advise the Company regarding the sale of common stock in the Offerings. Sandler O'Neill accepts the appointment and agrees to provide advisory services. The Agent is required to consult as to the securities marketing implications of the plans or related corporate documents; assist in the design and implementation of a marketing strategy for the Offerings; and assist management in preparing for meetings with potential investors. However, Sandler O'Neill's role is limited to providing advice, and the company retains complete control over all final decisions regarding marketing and sales strategies.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'best efforts to assist,' implying an active role in solicitation. The modified version emphasizes 'advisory services' and states that the company retains 'complete control', significantly reducing the agent's obligations in a way that might conflict if other sections still refer to Sandler O'Neill's active role in solicitation.",

In recognition of the long lead times involved in the conversion process, the Bank agreed to make an advance payment to the Agent in the amount of $25,000, all of which has been previously paid, which shall be credited against any fees or reimbursement of expenses payable hereunder. In the event that the advance payment exceeds the amount due in payment of fees and reimbursement of expenses hereunder, the excess shall be refunded.",
                "changed_text": "All undisputed fees payable to the Agent shall be payable within 90 days of Closing Time, contingent upon the Agent providing a detailed invoice outlining all services rendered. The advance payment of $25,000 will be considered a non-refundable deposit and will not be credited against final fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text states fees are payable at Closing Time, while the modified version delays payment by 90 days and requires an invoice. Additionally, the original text describes the advance payment as a credit, whereas the modified text labels it non-refundable, creating contradictory terms about payment timing and how the advance payment is applied.",

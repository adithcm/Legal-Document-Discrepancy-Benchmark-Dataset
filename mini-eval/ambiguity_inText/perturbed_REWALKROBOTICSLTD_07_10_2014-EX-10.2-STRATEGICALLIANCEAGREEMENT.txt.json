                "original_text": "The parties acknowledge that the purpose of this agreement shall be to seek and develop possibilities for collaboration in the following areas:\n\n  (a) Marketing, distribution, and commercialization of ARGO's products by YEC, subject to the terms and conditions contained in thisAgreement and a separate Distribution Agreement being entered into concurrently with this Agreement (hereafter \"DA\").\n\n  (b) Marketing and distribution of future YEC products in the area of healthcare equipment by ARGO within the scope of its salesnetwork.",
                "changed_text": "The parties acknowledge that the purpose of this agreement shall be to seek and develop possibilities for collaboration in the following areas:\n\n  (a) Marketing, distribution, and commercialization of ARGO's products by YEC, subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. Any distribution agreement is subject to future negotiation and may not be entered into concurrently with this Agreement (hereafter \"DA\").\n\n  (b) Marketing and distribution of future YEC products in the area of healthcare equipment by ARGO within the scope of its salesnetwork.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that a Distribution Agreement (DA) will be entered into concurrently with this agreement, making it a defined and expected part of the collaboration. The modified text introduces uncertainty by suggesting that a DA is subject to future negotiation and may not be entered into concurrently. This creates a contradiction because the 'DA' is defined as concurrent, but then stated it may not happen at the same time.",

                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other party, which termination will be effective immediately upon such notice, if the other party defaults in the performance of any of its material obligations provided for in this Agreement and fails to cure such default within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice from the other party of such default, unless a plan for remedying such default has been proposed by the defaulting party and accepted by the non- defaulting party within such period.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other party, which termination will be effective immediately upon such notice, if the other party defaults in the performance of any of its obligations provided for in this Agreement and fails to cure such default within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice from the other party of such default, unless a plan for remedying such default has been proposed by the defaulting party and accepted by the non- defaulting party within such period.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'material obligations' to 'any of its obligations' significantly broadens the grounds for termination. Previously, only a failure to perform 'material' obligations (presumably key or essential duties) could trigger immediate termination. Now, any failure, no matter how minor, could potentially lead to termination, creating a conflict with other sections that may imply a need for reasonable efforts or good faith.",

                "changed_text": "All disputes arising pursuant to this Agreement may be brought in the courts of competent jurisdiction residing in Tel Aviv, Israel.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' alters the mandatory nature of the dispute resolution process. The original clause mandates that all disputes must be resolved in Tel Aviv courts. The modified clause makes it permissive, implying that disputes could potentially be resolved elsewhere. This contradicts the intention of exclusive jurisdiction and introduces uncertainty about where legal proceedings should occur.",

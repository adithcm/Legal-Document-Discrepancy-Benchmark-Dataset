Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce, and upon confirmed the first order, this client come to be exclusive of Distributor, every new customer introduced by Distributor, must be approved by the company prior to any sale. After official approval from the Company, the customer introduced by Distributor, will appear on an official list in this contract, and will only be met by the Distributor and will follow the rules of this agreement.

Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce, and upon confirmed the first order, this client come to be exclusive of Distributor. Every new customer introduced by Distributor will automatically become the Distributor's client with no required approval from the company. The customer introduced by Distributor will operate under a separate agreement independent from the terms set forth in this primary Agreement, and will only be met by the Distributor.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that new customers introduced by the distributor must be approved by the company before any sale, and those customers will follow the rules of the agreement. The modified text eliminates the need for approval and states that new customers will operate under a separate agreement. This creates a contradiction regarding the approval process and which agreement governs the relationship with these customers.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants the distributor an 'exclusive' right, restricts sales outside the territory, prohibits the company from selling to the distributor's customers except through the distributor, and requires the company to get approval before contacting distributor's customers. The modified text changes 'exclusive' to 'non-exclusive,' removes the territorial restriction, allows the company to sell directly to the distributor's customers, and eliminates the need for approval before the company can contact those customers. This creates a direct contradiction concerning the distributor's exclusivity, territory limitations, and customer relationship management.",

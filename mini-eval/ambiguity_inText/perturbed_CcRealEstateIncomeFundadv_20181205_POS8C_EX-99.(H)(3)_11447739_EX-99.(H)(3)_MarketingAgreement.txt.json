S2K shall devote sufficient staff and expenditures to the performance of its services as shall be consistent with industry standards for the marketing of shares of the Fund. S2K shall perform these services in a professional and competent manner and shall provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as it determines may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to provide such services at no cost to the Distributor.",

S2K shall devote sufficient staff and expenditures to the performance of its services as it deems appropriate for the marketing of shares of the Fund. S2K will strive to perform these services in a manner that is generally competent and shall provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as it determines may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to provide such services at a reasonable cost to the Distributor, not to exceed $10,000 annually, subject to prior written approval by the Distributor.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and contradictions by weakening the performance standard from 'consistent with industry standards' to 'as it deems appropriate'. Also, the requirement of providing services 'at no cost to the Distributor' is contradicted by allowing S2K to charge up to $10,000 annually with prior approval, creating uncertainty regarding expense responsibilities.",

Compensation; Expenses (a) As described in the Fund's Prospectus, the Fund may impose a sales charge \"load\" in connection with the purchase of shares of the Fund, a portion of which will be paid to S2K pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Prospectus. (b) In consideration of the marketing, sales and other related activities provided by S2K, the Distributor may compensate S2K for such services on each Fund's behalf and at the direction of each such Fund. The amount of compensation payable by the Distributor to S2K hereunder shall be determined on a class by class basis. At the direction of each Fund, ALPS or its designated agent will facilitate the payment of the applicable dealer reallowance fee to S2K in the amounts set forth in Exhibit B hereto. S2K shall perform such distribution-related activities for which such payments are appropriate under all applicable rules and regulations and shall make such occasional certification as required by the Distributor to such effect. (c) No compensation with respect to a Fund shall be due and owing hereunder until the Distributor actually receives payments from such Fund, to the extent applicable. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall S2K be entitled to receive fees or compensation that would cause a Fund's sales charges to exceed the maximum amount allowed under FINRA rules or applicable law. (e) S2K shall reimburse Distributor for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including but not limited to: FINRA advertising/filing fees (including additional fees for expedited reviews as set forth in Section 2(b) herein).",

(b) In consideration of the marketing, sales and other related activities provided by S2K, the Distributor will compensate S2K for such services on each Fund's behalf and at the direction of each such Fund. The amount of compensation payable by the Distributor to S2K hereunder shall be a flat fee of $5,000 per month, irrespective of class. At the direction of each Fund, ALPS or its designated agent will facilitate the payment of the applicable dealer reallowance fee to S2K in the amounts set forth in Exhibit B hereto, unless otherwise notified in writing by the Distributor. S2K shall perform such distribution-related activities for which such payments are appropriate under all applicable rules and regulations and shall make such occasional certification as required by the Distributor to such effect. (c) No compensation with respect to a Fund shall be due and owing hereunder until the Distributor actually receives payments from such Fund, to the extent applicable, unless a prior agreement has been made to pay a salary.

(e) S2K shall be entitled to reimbursement from Distributor for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including but not limited to: FINRA advertising/filing fees (including additional fees for expedited reviews as set forth in Section 2(b) herein), plus all travel and lodging expenses up to $2,000 per month with receipts.",
                "explanation": "This introduces several contradictions. First, it changes the compensation from a portion of sales charges described in the Prospectus (variable) to a fixed $5,000 monthly fee, creating conflict. Then, it adds 'unless otherwise notified in writing by the Distributor' potentially negating the exhibit B. Further, it changes S2K reimbursing the distributor to the Distributor reimbursing the travel and lodging, again with receipts.",

Each party to this Agreement shall obtain the other party's prior written consent before using any marketing or sales literature related to the consenting party, except that S2K may, at its discretion, use the Distributor's name in generic marketing materials without explicit approval, so long as such use is limited to identifying the Distributor as a service provider. However, the Distributor must seek written consent for all uses of S2K's name and materials.",
                "explanation": "This creates conflicting obligations regarding the use of names in marketing materials. The original clause requires 'prior written consent' from both parties. The modified version creates an exception for S2K, allowing them to use the Distributor's name in generic marketing materials without explicit approval, while maintaining the requirement for the Distributor to always seek written consent from S2K. This contradiction creates ambiguity and potential disputes.",

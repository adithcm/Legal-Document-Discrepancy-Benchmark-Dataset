                "original_text": "PROGRAM means ForceField PSS software developed by XIMAGE including the Sybase and Focus software and includes all software provided under the Maintenance Agreement.\n\nPROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS means the specifications published by XIMAGE for a particular version of the Program (if no such specification is available, then the relevant documentation for a particular version of the Program).",
                "changed_text": "PROGRAM means ForceField PSS software developed by XIMAGE including the Sybase and Focus software and includes only the initial version of the software provided under the Maintenance Agreement.\n\nPROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS means the specifications outlined by MORPHO for a particular version of the Program, agreed upon during the initial negotiation phase, and documented separately (if no such specification document exists, the Program shall be evaluated based on commonly accepted industry standards).",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Program' is changed to exclude updates and modifications, conflicting with section 3 which covers 'Software Maintenance Services' including error fixing. If 'Program' in Section 1 only refers to the initial version, maintenance services become ambiguous. The 'Program Specifications' definition is also shifted from XIMAGE to MORPHO, creating a contradiction and uncertainty about whose specifications are authoritative.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies 24/7 support with a 30-minute response time. The modified text limits support to business hours and increases the response time to two business days. This creates a direct contradiction, impacting the level of support MORPHO can expect.",

The foregoing indemnification by XIMAGE shall not apply with respect to any claim based, in whole or part, on any modification of the Software made by any person other than XIMAGE.",

MORPHO shall have the right to participate in the defense of such claim at its own expense. This indemnification does not cover claims arising from modifications not made by XIMAGE, or if the claim is due to use of the Software in conjunction with other software not approved by XIMAGE.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear and unconditional indemnification from XIMAGE against intellectual property infringement claims, giving XIMAGE sole control of the defense. The modified version introduces uncertainty by making the indemnification discretionary ('may, at its discretion') and limiting the scope of covered claims and giving MORPHO right to participate. This creates a contradiction, as it is not definitive if XIMAGE will provide full indemnification.",

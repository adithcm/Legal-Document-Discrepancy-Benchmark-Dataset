Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",
                "changed_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, except that the confidentiality provisions outlined in Section 8 of the Original Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, all other provisions of the Original Agreement do not survive such termination.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that 'no provisions' survive while simultaneously making an exception for the confidentiality clause, thus creating uncertainty about the complete termination of the original agreement.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Termination Agreement represents the agreement between the parties regarding the termination of the Original Agreement. While this agreement is intended to be comprehensive, certain implied understandings and practices previously established between the parties may continue to influence the interpretation of this Termination Agreement. Modifications can only be achieved through official amendments with written consent by both parties.",
                "explanation": "By stating the agreement is 'intended to be comprehensive' and that 'certain implied understandings...may continue to influence the interpretation' creates doubt about the completeness of the termination agreement, which contradicts the original statement. It's unclear to what extent these 'implied understandings' apply.",

This Termination Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, however, assignment of rights or obligations under this agreement is subject to prior written consent from both parties and contingent upon fulfillment of outstanding obligations, if any, under the Original Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a condition of 'prior written consent' and 'fulfillment of outstanding obligations' for assignment, contradicting the original statement that the agreement simply 'inure to the benefit of...successors and assigns' without any stated conditions, creating uncertainty regarding the extent to which successors/assigns benefit.",

Subject to approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company shall issue and sell to the Consultant, and the Consultant shall purchase from the Company, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Restricted Stock Agreement, 1,990,000 shares (the \"Shares\") of common stock, $0.0001 par value, of the Company (\"Common Stock\"), at a purchase price of $0.0001 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $190. Such Shares are in addition to the 10,000 shares of Common Stock held by the Consultant as of the date hereof.

                "explanation": "Changing 'the Company shall issue and sell' to 'The Company intends to issue and sell' introduces ambiguity regarding the company's obligation to issue all 1,990,000 shares. This creates uncertainty in enforcement because it's no longer a guaranteed commitment, potentially leading to disputes over the number of shares the consultant is entitled to.",

In the event of such termination, the Consultant shall be entitled to payment hereunder and for expenses paid or incurred prior to the effective date of termination.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may terminate the Consultation Period effective immediately upon receipt of written notice by the Consultant, if the Consultant breaches or threatens to breach any provision of Section 6. For purposes of this Section 4, \"Cause\" shall exist in the event of (i) a good faith finding by the Board of Directors of the Company (A) of repeated and willful failure of the Consultant after written notice to perform his reasonable Services for the Company, or (B) that the Consultant has engaged in dishonesty, gross negligence or misconduct; or (ii) the conviction of the Consultant of, or the entry of a pleading of guilty or nolo contendere by the Consultant to, any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony. The Consultant may terminate the Consultation Period at any time upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'repeated and willful' and 'after written notice' from (A) and 'gross negligence' and 'moral turpitude' from (B) and (ii), the definition of 'Cause' becomes more vague and encompasses a broader range of actions. Also removing 'nolo contendere' makes it less comprehensive. This creates a contradiction because the initial statement implies a higher threshold ('Cause' as defined below), but the amended definition allows for termination based on less severe or clearly defined transgressions. It becomes unclear what level of failure or misconduct warrants termination for cause.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'or jointly with others or under Consultant's direction' restricts the scope of inventions assigned to the company. If the consultant co-creates with someone outside the company, it may not belong to the company. By changing 'related to the business' to 'directly related to the core business', we narrow the definition of Inventions belonging to the company. This creates potential dispute, because, for example, if the Consultant co-creates an Invention, or if the consultant created an invention related to future Company business plans, which definition rules?",

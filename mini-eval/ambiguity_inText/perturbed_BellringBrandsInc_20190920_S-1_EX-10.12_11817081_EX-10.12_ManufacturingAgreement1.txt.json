                "original_text": "Heritage shall purchase all ingredients and packaging materials identified in Schedule C to be used in connection with the manufacture of the Products. Heritage shall invoice Premier through the [***] billing as identified on Schedule C.",
                "changed_text": "Heritage may purchase all ingredients and packaging materials identified in Schedule C to be used in connection with the manufacture of the Products. Heritage shall invoice Premier through a billing process mutually agreed upon by both parties, irrespective of what is stated in Schedule C.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates Heritage to purchase all ingredients and follow the billing process outlined in Schedule C. The modified text introduces flexibility (may purchase) and contradicts the original fixed billing method, creating ambiguity. This affects the cost predictability for Premier.",

                "changed_text": "Failure by Premier to meet payment terms of any invoice may result in interest being imposed on any unpaid balance. The specific interest rate will be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account Premier's payment history and prevailing market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed interest rate for late payments. The modified text replaces this with a discretionary, undefined rate, introducing uncertainty and potential disputes over what constitutes a 'reasonable' rate and whether it complies with legal limits. This undermines the contract's clarity on financial obligations.",

At Premier's option, Premier can direct Heritage to, and upon such direction Heritage shall, conduct such Recall Action (and Heritage shall ensure Jasper's cooperation).",
                "changed_text": "Premier shall generally have the right to initiate a Recall Action, but Heritage reserves the right to dispute the necessity or scope of such action if it believes the action is not warranted by the facts or applicable regulations. In such cases, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the appropriate course of action, with Heritage being required to conduct the Recall Action only if it is legally compelled to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Premier sole discretion over recall actions. The modified text allows Heritage to challenge this, creating ambiguity over who ultimately decides on and executes a recall. This contradiction introduces a potential conflict of interest and uncertainty regarding regulatory compliance and product safety management.",

                "original_text": "\"Annual Product Review Report\" means the annual product review report as described in Title 21 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Section 211.180(e); \"Annual Report\" means the annual report as described in Title 21 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.81(b)(2);",

                "explanation": "The first definition refers to a report under Section 314.81(b)(2), which specifies its content, while the second gives it a vague definition that permits different interpretations. This creates contradiction since in some contexts, the undefined annual report may be insufficient.",

Subject to Antares' obligation to cover the costs set forth in Section 5.3(b), AMAG shall be responsible for all costs incurred due to the Recall of a Product, sample Product or Trainer.",
                "changed_text": "AMAG shall be primarily responsible for managing all Recalls, but Antares may also participate in the recall management at its discretion. Subject to Antares' obligation to cover the costs set forth in Section 5.3(b), AMAG shall typically be responsible for the costs incurred due to the Recall of a Product, sample Product or Trainer unless otherwise agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states AMAG's responsibility for managing recalls. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that AMAG is 'primarily' responsible and allows Antares to 'participate' at its discretion, creating uncertainty about control and responsibility. The change from 'shall be responsible' to 'shall typically be responsible' also introduces uncertainty.",

Such insurance may be provided in more than one separate insurance policy and/or on claims made or claims made and reported forms as is common in the insurance marketplace for similar risks. If requested each Party will provide the other with a current and valid certificate of insurance evidencing the above and showing the name of the issuing company, the policy number, the effective date, the expiration date and the limits of liability.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall obtain and maintain commercial general liability insurance, including product liability insurance, but the specific coverage and limits shall be determined by each Party's internal risk management policies. While it is preferred that the insurance afford limits of not less than (i) $[***] for each occurrence; and (ii) $[***] in the aggregate per annum, compliance is at the discretion of the insured party. Each Party will endeavor to provide the other with a certificate of insurance evidencing the general nature of their coverage.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets specific insurance requirements that must be met. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the specific coverage is determined by 'internal risk management policies' and that the stated limits are 'preferred' but not mandatory. This creates uncertainty and undermines the original, clear requirements.",

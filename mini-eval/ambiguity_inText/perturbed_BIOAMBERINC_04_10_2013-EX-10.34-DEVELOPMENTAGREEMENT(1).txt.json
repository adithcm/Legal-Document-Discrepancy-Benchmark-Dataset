                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Improvements' scope as limited to the CB1 strain itself and the Field. The modified text expands this definition to include any advancement in the fermentation process regardless of the CB1 strain, creating a contradiction about the scope of 'Improvements'. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over intellectual property ownership.",

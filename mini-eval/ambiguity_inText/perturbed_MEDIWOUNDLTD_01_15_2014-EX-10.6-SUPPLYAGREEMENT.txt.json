                "explanation": "The original text states that the forecast is non-binding, but then mandates MediWound to order at least [***]% of the Annual Forecast. The modified text changes 'undertakes to order' to 'is encouraged to order,' removing the obligation to purchase a specific amount. This creates a contradiction with other sections relying on the forecast for capacity planning and pricing, making it unclear what level of obligation the buyer has to the forecast.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a minimum 24 month notice period for termination by CBC, but qualifies it with a provision for a potentially longer period if MediWound needs more time to find an alternative supplier. The modified text removes this qualification and shortens the minimum notice period to 6 months, creating a conflict regarding the appropriate amount of notice required. This impacts MediWound's ability to secure supply if CBC decides to terminate.",

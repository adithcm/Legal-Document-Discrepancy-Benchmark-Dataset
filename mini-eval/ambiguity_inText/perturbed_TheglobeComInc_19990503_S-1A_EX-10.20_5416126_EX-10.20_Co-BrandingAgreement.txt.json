                "explanation": "The original section explicitly disclaims all warranties, including merchantability. The modified version contradicts this by introducing exceptions: 'EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY WARRANTED IN EXHIBIT A' and explicitly stating merchantability is NOT disclaimed and also indicates that 'GUARANTEES OUTLINED IN EXHIBIT A' are also relied upon. This creates ambiguity, as it is unclear if warranties are fully disclaimed or if Exhibit A provides exceptions, thus creating an in-text contradiction.",

Neither party shall disclose any User Data in any manner that permits the User Data to be associated with the other party or permits the targeting of Users on the basis of their status as Users (in theglobe's case) or theglobe users (in Boxlot's case), nor shall a party use the User Data to target Users on the basis of their status as Users (in theglobe's case) or theglobe users (in Boxlot's case).  However, either party may disclose User Data if it is aggregated (in a non-associatable way) with data from multiple online properties.

Except as specified in this section and in section 2.9, each party may freely use and disclose any information (both individual and aggregated) about Users (\"User Data\"), specifically for the purpose of database synchronization as per section 2.9.  Neither party shall disclose any User Data in any manner that permits the User Data to be associated with the other party or permits the targeting of Users on the basis of their status as Users (in theglobe's case) or theglobe users (in Boxlot's case), unless otherwise specified in Section 2.9. However, either party may disclose User Data if it is aggregated (in a non-associatable way) with data from multiple online properties, or if it benefits cross-promotional campaigns outlined in exhibit A.

                "explanation": "The original clause restricts use of User Data for targeting users based on their association with the other party. The modified version introduces exceptions tied to Section 2.9 (Database Synchronization), Exhibit A (Cross-promotional Campaigns), and legal waivers, creating conflicting interpretations of what constitutes acceptable use of User Data and adding uncertainty to the initial restrictions. This in-text contradiction makes it unclear when these restrictions apply, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original section allows for immediate termination for material breach with a 15-day cure period. The modified version changes this by removing 'material' and introducing 'initiate a cure' which is then subject to a good faith negotiation, thus making the termination right subject to the other party's willingness to negotiate. It also changes the right to terminate immediately when boxlot violates section 12.1 compliance with law, but adding 'reasonable chance to rectify the failure to comply' which is vague, and then indicates that it only applies 'as long as the breach is not caused by an unforeseen change of laws.' The original termination clause was more firm, but the modified version introduces ambiguity and weakens the termination clause due to the change in conditions to terminate.",

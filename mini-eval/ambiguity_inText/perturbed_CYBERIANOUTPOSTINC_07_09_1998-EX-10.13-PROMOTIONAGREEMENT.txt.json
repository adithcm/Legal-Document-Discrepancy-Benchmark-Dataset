The changed text introduces a contradiction by stating CNET will 'endeavor to provide approximately' which does not specify the number, and if they fail to provide them, they will 'attempt to display a reasonable number' thus making the obligation less strict and creating ambiguity regarding CNET's commitment and liabilities.",

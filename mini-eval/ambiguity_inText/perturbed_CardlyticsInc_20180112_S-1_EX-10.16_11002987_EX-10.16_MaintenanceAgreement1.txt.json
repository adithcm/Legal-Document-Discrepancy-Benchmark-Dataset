                "original_text": "1.4 Affiliate - a business entity now or hereafter controlled by, controlling or under common control with a Party. Control exists when an entity owns or controls directly or indirectly 50% or more of the outstanding equity representing the right to vote for the election of directors or other managing authority of another entity.",
                "changed_text": "1.4 Affiliate - a business entity now or hereafter controlled by, controlling or under common control with a Party. Control exists when an entity owns or controls directly or indirectly 25% or more of the outstanding equity representing the right to vote for the election of directors or other managing authority of another entity.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting definition for 'Affiliate'. The original definition states that control exists at 50% or more ownership, while the modified version lowers the threshold to 25%. This contradiction could lead to disputes over which entities qualify as affiliates and thus, which entities are bound by the terms applicable to affiliates within the agreement.",

An Error is a Class 2 Error if the Software is still usable for its intended purpose, but such use is seriously inconvenient and the value to Bank of America of the use of the Software is substantially reduced. All other Errors are Class 3 Errors.",
                "changed_text": "1.19 Error - an instance of failure of Software to be Operative. An Error is a Class 1 Error if it renders the Software unusable for any purpose. An Error is a Class 2 Error if the Software is still usable for its intended purpose, but such use is slightly inconvenient. All other Errors are Class 3 Errors.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in defining what constitutes a Class 1 and Class 2 Error. Originally, a Class 1 error made the software unusable for its 'intended' purpose, while a Class 2 error substantially reduced its value to Bank of America. The modified version broadens Class 1 to 'any' purpose and lessens the impact of Class 2 to 'slightly' inconvenient. The change in Class 1 Error from 'intended' to 'any' purpose could have a massive impact. This now means that any non-intended purpose (regardless of if it is crucial or not) would cause a Class 1 Error. This creates a contradiction as now there are no more class 2 or 3 Errors, potentially leading to disputes over the severity of software malfunctions.",

Termination of one Order shall not cause a termination of this Agreement or any other Order, unless otherwise specified by Bank of America.",

Termination of one Order shall cause a termination of this Agreement and all other Orders, unless otherwise specified by Supplier.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the effect of terminating a single Order. The original text states that terminating one order does not terminate the entire agreement unless specified by Bank of America, while the modified version states that it does terminate the agreement unless specified by the Supplier. This contradictory provision creates ambiguity regarding the scope of termination rights and obligations, potentially leading to legal disputes.",

The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the fifteenth(15 th ) day of each calendar month based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar month. 4.2.2 You shall pay to us a franchise sales royalty fee (the \"Franchise Sales Royalty Fee\") for each Unit Franchise you sell in the Master Territory as follows: twenty-five percent (25%) of the initial franchise fee collected from each Unit Franchisee upon execution of the Unit Franchisee's Franchise Agreement (a \"Unit Franchise Agreement\"); provided, however, that if you elect to discount or reduce an initial franchise fee for any reason, the Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be payable to us as if the full initial franchise fee had been paid. The Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us at the same time and in the same manner as the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee provided in Section 4.2.1 above. Any Royalty Fee you collect from the Franchisee shall be immediately paid to Us, but no later than the fifteen (15 th ) day of each calendar month. A Unit Franchise shall be deemed to be sold to a Unit Franchisee on the date that you and the Unit Franchisee execute the Unit Franchise Agreement, irrespective of when the Unit Franchise begins operation.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions for the 'Franchise Sales Royalty Fee' amount (25% vs. 15%) and for the point in time when a Unit Franchise is considered 'sold' (date of agreement vs. date of operation). This creates uncertainty in enforcement as to which percentage should be applied and when the payment obligation arises.",

                "explanation": "This introduces conflicting insurance requirements. Section 5.5.1 now states a minimum general liability coverage of $1,000,000 while 5.5.2 states a minimum automobile liability insurance coverage of $2,000,000, previously it was the opposite. Also, previously the master franchisee may elect to obtain the general liability insurance for the unit franchisees, now is not required to. This creates ambiguity regarding the required insurance coverage amount and who should maintain it.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces conflict regarding advertising. First, regarding the obligation to conduct advertising to solicit the unit franchisees (Shall vs May). Second, the time to submit the sample (15 vs 5 days) and the time for approval (15 days vs 30 days) and approval process (You may use vs You may not use). Finally the need of approval from the governmental agency, and the faculty of the franchisor to authorize the further use, when the initial idea was to prohibit it.",

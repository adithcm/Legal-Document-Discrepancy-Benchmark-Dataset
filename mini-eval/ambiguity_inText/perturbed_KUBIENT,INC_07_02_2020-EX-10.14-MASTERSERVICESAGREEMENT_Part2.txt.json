                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by contradicting the original text stating revenue sharing regardless of which party secures the revenue. The modified text now states that revenue sharing only applies if Kubient is responsible. This creates a contradiction and could lead to disputes over revenue allocation.",

For \"Direct Deals\", \"Revenue\" shall refer to Net Revenue, defined as gross revenue actually received by the collecting party less client credits and allowances for returns and less any agreed upon costs incurred by either Party in support of a \"Direct Deal\" for such things as production, photography, video, content creation and/or media buying (i.e. Nativo).",

For \"Direct Deals\", \"Revenue\" shall refer to gross revenue actually received by the collecting party.",
                "explanation": "Here, the definition of revenue for Direct Deals has been altered. Previously it was clearly defined as net revenue (gross revenue less certain costs). This change modifies the definition, causing ambiguity. If other parts of the contract refer back to the 'Revenue' definition within this section, it is now unclear whether 'Direct Deals' revenue is gross or net, leading to potential financial disputes.",

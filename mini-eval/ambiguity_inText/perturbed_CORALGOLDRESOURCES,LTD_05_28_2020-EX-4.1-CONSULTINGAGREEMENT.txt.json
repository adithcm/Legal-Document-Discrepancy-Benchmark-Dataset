FEES\n\n3.1 The Company will pay the Consultant basic remuneration for its services in the sum of $10,000 per month (the \"Consulting Fee\") commencing on the 1st day of February, 2020, and payable on the last day of each month thereafter up to and including the 31st day of January, 2025, together with any such increments thereto as the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time determine. In addition, the Company will pay to the Consultant all reasonable expenses of the Consultant as agreed to from time to time which are incurred by the Consultant in delivery of the Services, based on monthly invoices submitted to the Company, including copies of all paid receipts; plus harmonized sales taxes or goods and services taxes, as the case may be, in addition to the Consulting Fees, which taxes will be remitted by the Consultant to the Canada Revenue Agency.",

FEES\n\n3.1 The Company will pay the Consultant basic remuneration for its services, which is subject to negotiation and determined by the Company's financial status each month. The initial Consulting Fee is set at $10,000 per month commencing on the 1st day of February, 2020, and payable at the discretion of the Company based on performance reviews, up to and including the 31st day of January, 2025. Any increments or reductions thereto are at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, the Company may, at its discretion, pay for reasonable expenses of the Consultant incurred in the delivery of Services, based on invoices submitted; plus harmonized sales taxes or goods and services taxes, as the case may be, in addition to the Consulting Fees, which taxes will be remitted by the Consultant to the Canada Revenue Agency.",

The original contract specifies a fixed monthly fee, while the modified version makes the fee negotiable, dependent on financial status and performance reviews, and payable at the Company's discretion. This directly contradicts the certainty of the original payment terms.",

The modified version introduces uncertainty by adding 'however, the company reserves the right to deny such termination based on project needs' to consultant termination and changing mandatory 'termination payment' to 'potentially a termination payment...subject to board approval.' The compensation amount in Change of Control is now also 'subject to negotiation at the time of termination' instead of a clear 750,000. The changes makes the previously concrete terms now ambigious and uncertain.",

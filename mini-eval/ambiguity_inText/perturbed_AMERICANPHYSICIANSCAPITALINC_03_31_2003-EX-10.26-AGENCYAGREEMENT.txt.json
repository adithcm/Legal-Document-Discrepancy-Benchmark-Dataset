Provided that, if a particular risk has been                   submitted to MICOA and MICOA has declined that risk, then                   Agency may search appropriate markets for placement of that                   risk, and may place that risk with another insurance company.",
                "changed_text": "In return for the exclusive appointment of Agency by MICOA to sell its professional liability products listed on the                  &sbsp;attached Commission Schedule\n\nin Nevada, Agency agrees to prioritize MICOAâ€™s products but retains the right to sell competing professional liability products in Nevada, even without the written consent of MICOA, provided that the Agency informs MICOA within 30 days of initiating the sale of such competing products. Provided that, if a particular risk has been                   submitted to MICOA and MICOA has declined that risk, then                   Agency may search appropriate markets for placement of that                   risk, and may place that risk with another insurance company.",
                "explanation": "The original clause prohibits selling competing products without written consent. The modified clause allows it with just notification, creating a contradiction. This affects enforcement regarding exclusivity; it's unclear if MICOA can prevent sales or is merely entitled to notice.",

However, the payment timeline is subject to MICOA's internal auditing procedures, which may extend the payment period up to 90 days. All payments are subject to deduction by MICOA of any                   return commissions due from the Agency.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a 30-day payment window. The modified clause adds a discretionary extension based on auditing, creating ambiguity. This introduces conflicting terms, because the auditing procedures are not outlined and may lead to the agency not receiving payments in the agreed timeline.",

The                   purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on                   business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full                   months preceding the termination date.

The                   purchase price will be based on a fair market value assessment, not to exceed two times Agency's commissions on                   business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full                   months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be                   completed within a reasonable timeframe, subject to negotiation between both parties after the termination date.",
                "explanation": "The original clause sets a fixed calculation for the purchase price of expirations (2x commissions) and a 60-day completion timeframe. The modified version introduces 'fair market value assessment' and 'reasonable timeframe', creating a contradiction since the new changes can lower the price or time of acquisition from the original fixed number.",

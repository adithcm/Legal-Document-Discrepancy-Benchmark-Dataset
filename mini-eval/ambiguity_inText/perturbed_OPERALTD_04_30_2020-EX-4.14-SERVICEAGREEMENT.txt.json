End user data and user account details are explicitly excluded from this definition.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Business Data\" is changed to specifically exclude end user data and user account details, which contradicts the original definition that includes them.

PC Financial shall pay to Mobimagic a service fee, the amount of which will be determined based on a performance metric agreed upon each month, but generally around 970,000 United States Dollars (USD 970,000) (the \"Fee\"). Mobimagic will send an invoice to PC Financial on monthly basis according to the progress of the service. After PC Financial confirms that invoice contents are correct, PC Financial shall pay within 90 days after confirming thus.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces contradiction by changing the payment scheme from a fixed monthly fee of USD 970,000 to one determined on a monthly performance metric. Additionally, payment timeline has been modified from 45 days to 90 days after confirmation of the invoice, changing the financial obligation timelines between parties.",

Each Party undertakes to safeguard the Confidential Information of the other Party, but this obligation is waived in cases where disclosure is required by law. Such obligations will survive the expiration of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years.",
                "explanation": "The confidentiality clause is weakened by allowing disclosure to affiliates and subcontractors and when required by law. The survival period has been changed from five years to two years. This creates a contradiction as the initial part of the clause states no third parties at all can view the information, while the modified clause makes exceptions. The different durations cause uncertainty.",

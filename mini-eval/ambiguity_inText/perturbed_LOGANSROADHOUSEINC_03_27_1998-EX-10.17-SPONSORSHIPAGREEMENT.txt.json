For the 1998 racing season, Logan's shall be the primary sponsor of the Team, which fields a LMSC racing vehicle (the \"Race Car\") driven by Brad Baker.

During the term of this Agreement, SRP may represent other products or companies as long as they are not direct competitors in the restaurant industry, at SRP's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the definition of 'primary sponsor'. Originally, SRP couldn't represent any product or company deemed competitive by Logan's. Now, SRP has the discretion to represent other products/companies as long as they aren't direct competitors in the restaurant industry. This creates conflict because Logan's could deem something competitive that SRP does not, leading to disputes.",

Except as specifically provided in this Agreement,  Brad Baker (\"Baker\") will be the only driver for the Team for the term of this Agreement. If Baker is unavailable to perform as driver as a result of injury, illness or any other disability, or cause beyond his control, SRP shall provide an alternate driver subject to the approval of Logan's (\"Alternate Driver\"), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Brad Baker (\"Baker\") will be the primary driver for the Team for the term of this Agreement. If Baker is unavailable to perform as driver as a result of injury, illness or any other disability, or cause beyond his control, SRP may, at its sole discretion, provide an alternate driver with no prior approval from Logan's. SRP will inform Logan's of any replacement no more than 2 days after such a change. The Driver shall not drive for any other sponsor which competes with Logan's. The Driver shall not drive any other race vehicle for any other sponsor than Logan's without prior written notice from SRP to Logan's.",
                "explanation": "This change creates conflict in the 'driver' definition. Originally, Baker was the 'only driver' unless Logan's approved an alternate. Now, SRP has sole discretion to select an alternate, and there's no guarantee who that alternate is. The new 'inform after replacement' term undermines Logan's right to approve/disapprove of a replacement and therefore their primary sponsorship. This might cause issues regarding advertising and image.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces inconsistencies in the confidentiality terms. Originally, 'due care' was required, and sharing with agents required approval. The modified version changes 'due care' to 'reasonable effort' (weaker standard) and allows disclosure to financial advisors/legal counsel without consent, creating exceptions. The allowance to share sponsorship details for promotion, unless otherwise agreed, directly conflicts with the original strict confidentiality requirement, causing disputes over what information is truly confidential.",

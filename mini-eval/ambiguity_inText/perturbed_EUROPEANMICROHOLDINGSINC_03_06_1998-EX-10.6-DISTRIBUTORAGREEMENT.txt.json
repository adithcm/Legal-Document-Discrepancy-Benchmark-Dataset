WGT may, from time to time, change its WatchGuard Price List, provided that any such change will not be effective under this Agreement unless and until the expiration of forty-five (45) days after WGT gives Distributor written notices of the change.",

WGT may change its WatchGuard Price List at any time and such changes shall be effective immediately upon notification to the Distributor. WGT will use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of price changes, but immediate changes are permissible.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 45-day waiting period for price list changes to take effect. The modified text allows for immediate price changes upon notification, creating a contradiction about the effective date of price changes, which could lead to disputes over invoiced amounts.",

In order to receive the remedy provided for hereunder, Distributor shall deliver to WGT a sample of the Product which Distributor finds to be defective in workmanship or materials, or damaged in shipment prior to Distributor assuming the risk of loss or damage , along with a written explanation of the alleged defect within thirty (30) days from the later of Distributor's initial receipt of such Product from WGT or from the delivery of such Product to an end-user.",

The determination of whether a product is truly 'defective' will be made solely at the discretion of the Distributor, who shall then inform WGT of their decision. In order to receive the remedy provided for hereunder, Distributor shall deliver to WGT a sample of the Product which Distributor finds to be defective in workmanship or materials, or damaged in shipment prior to Distributor assuming the risk of loss or damage , along with a written explanation of the alleged defect within ninety (90) days from Distributor's initial receipt of such Product from WGT.

                "explanation": "The original text refers to the 'limited warranty' and compliance with its terms. The modified text shifts the defect determination to the Distributor's discretion, conflicting with the original warranty's conditions. The original text indicates 30 days for reporting after the delivery to end-user. The modified text removes time limitation from delivery to an end-user and sets a specific 90 day window from WGT delivery, creating conflicting requirements for product returns.",

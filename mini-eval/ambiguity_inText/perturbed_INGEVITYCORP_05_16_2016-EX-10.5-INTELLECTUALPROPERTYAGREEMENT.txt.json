                "original_text": "1.3 \"Control\" or \"Controlled\" means, with respect to Intellectual Property, that SpinCo or a member of the SpinCo Group owns such Intellectual Property, in whole or in part, and/or has the right to grant a license to Parent with respect to such Intellectual Property as set forth herein and without incurring any financial or other obligations to any other Person, subject, in each case, to the terms of any license or other agreement to which SpinCo or any of the SpinCo Group is a party that relates to any such Intellectual Property.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 \"Control\" or \"Controlled\" means, with respect to Intellectual Property, that SpinCo or a member of the SpinCo Group owns such Intellectual Property, in whole or in part. It does not necessarily imply the right to grant a license to Parent, as such rights are subject to further negotiation and separate agreements.",
                "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity to the definition of 'Control' by removing the explicit right to grant licenses to Parent and adding a caveat that such rights are subject to further negotiation. This contradicts the original definition where 'Control' implied the right to grant licenses, creating uncertainty about the extent of SpinCo's control over intellectual property.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'such consent not to be unreasonably withheld' to 'such consent may be withheld at SpinCo's sole discretion,' this change creates a contradiction in the definition of 'Permitted Party.' The first definition implies a reasonable standard for withholding consent, while the second gives SpinCo unrestricted power, leading to uncertainty in determining which third parties qualify as 'Permitted Parties.'",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.",

The duration of the license shall be determined by the mutual agreement of both parties every five years, with potential extensions based on the current market conditions and the strategic alignment of both Parent and SpinCo. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP.

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the duration of the license granted to the Parent. Initially, the license is defined as 'irrevocable,' implying a permanent, unchangeable grant. However, the modified text states that the 'duration of the license shall be determined by the mutual agreement of both parties every five years,' creating a periodic review and potential termination or non-renewal point. This conflict introduces uncertainty about the long-term stability of the license and the rights granted to Parent.",

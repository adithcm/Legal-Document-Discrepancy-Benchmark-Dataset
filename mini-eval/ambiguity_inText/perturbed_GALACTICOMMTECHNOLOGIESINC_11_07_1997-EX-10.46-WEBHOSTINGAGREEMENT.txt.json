                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Galacticomm must provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This person(s) must be available by beeper or telephone. Horst Entertainment shall provide this same 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "changed_text": "Galacticomm must provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) during standard business hours, Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM. While Galacticomm will make reasonable efforts to address issues outside of these hours, there is no guarantee of immediate response. Horst Entertainment shall provide 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 24/7 support from Galacticomm. The modified text limits this to business hours, creating a contradiction with the original 24/7 requirement and the subsequent obligation of Horst Entertainment to provide 24 hour service. It's now unclear if Galacticomm has a continuous obligation.",

Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "changed_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm a mutually agreed upon amount per access up to 400,000 accesses; this rate is subject to change with 30 days written notice. After 400,000 accesses, the payment will be negotiated by both parties. Horst Entertainment shall send payment to Galacticomm within 30 days of receiving the invoice.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the payment structure and schedule. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing the specific rates with a vague agreement and negotiation, and changes the payment timeline from Wednesday to 'within 30 days of receiving the invoice'. This contradicts the original payment terms, creating uncertainty about the cost and timing of payments.",

                "changed_text": "In the event Galacticomm, Inc. chooses to terminate this agreement for reasons other than breach of contract by Horst Entertainment, Horst Entertainment Inc. may negotiate the purchase of a license copy of the software at a price to be determined at that time based on market value. However, Galacticomm is not obligated to sell said license.",
                "explanation": "The original text guarantees Horst Entertainment the right to purchase a license for a fixed price upon termination by Galacticomm. The modified text changes this to a negotiation based on market value and removes Galacticomm's obligation to sell, creating a contradiction. It's now uncertain if Horst has any right to purchase the license.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by removing 'or as source material' and 'but may not change the substance of the Content to any extent whatsoever without WebMD's written approval of the change'. The original contract clearly stated that the content should be provided verbatim or as source material, and that the substance of content cannot be changed without approval. The modified contract now allows for Emdeon to alter the substance of the content, creating a direct contradiction with the 'verbatim' condition and other clauses regarding content integrity.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the two-year restriction on using confidential information after the termination of the agreement, creating contradiction because the next sentense, which says 'The receiving party agrees to take reasonable precautions (no less rigorous than the receiving party takes with respect to its own comparable Confidential Information and Trade Secrets) to prevent unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets of the disclosing party.' suggests that reasonable precautions will be taken and should be done perpetually because it doesn't define time.

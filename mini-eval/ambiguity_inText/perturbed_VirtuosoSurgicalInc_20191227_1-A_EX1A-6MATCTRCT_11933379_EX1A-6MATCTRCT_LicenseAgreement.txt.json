                "original_text": "2.5 \"NET SALES\" shall mean gross sales revenues and fees billed by Company from the sale of LICENSED PRODUCT(S) less trade discounts allowed, refunds, returns and recalls, and sales taxes. In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in combination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be based on the sales revenues and fees received from the entire combination or kit.",
                "changed_text": "2.5 \"NET SALES\" shall mean gross sales revenues and fees billed by Company from the sale of LICENSED PRODUCT(S) less trade discounts allowed, refunds, returns and recalls, and sales taxes. In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in combination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be based solely on the incremental value attributable to the LICENSED PRODUCT(S) within the combination or kit, as reasonably determined by the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'NET SALES' calculates royalties on the entire combination or kit. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by stating NET SALES will be based on incremental value reasonably determined by the Company. This creates a conflict, as 'entire combination' and 'incremental value' are different calculation methods, and the 'reasonably determined by the company' clause gives the company latitude to minimize royalty payments.",

Sales worldwide under the PATENT RIGHT(S) in the LICENSED FIELD are subject to separate written agreement and royalty rates.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a license for worldwide sales. The modified text restricts sales to the United States, and creates an additional condition that international sales are subject to additional separate agreements, even though it initially granted worldwide sales, making it internally contradictory.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows JHU to terminate if no sales occur for four quarters. The modified clause introduces an exception if the company provides a market analysis and revised plan. This creates a conflict: JHU *may* terminate, but the company can prevent termination with a market analysis, introducing uncertainty in JHU's termination right.",

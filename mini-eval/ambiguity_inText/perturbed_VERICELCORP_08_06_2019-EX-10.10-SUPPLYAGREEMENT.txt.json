                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Conforming Product' sets a high standard of strict adherence to specifications and freedom from defects. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'substantially meets,' 'general accordance,' 'commercially reasonable freedom,' and 'likely to be prohibited'. If Section 6.3 still refers to the original strict definition when defining the Product Warranty, an internal contradiction arises, making it unclear whether MediWound is held to the higher or lower standard.",

MediWound will attempt to notify (or cause such Third Party packager to notify) Vericel at least [***] prior to any shipment of Products.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall only ship' to 'shall use its best endeavors to ship' introduces ambiguity by making the requirement to ship conforming products non-binding. Similarly, changing 'shall not ship' to 'shall aim not to ship' weakens the prohibition against shipping unapproved products. Further, Changing 'in accordance with cGMP as applicable' to 'with safety measures' brings uncertainty as to what should be applicable.",

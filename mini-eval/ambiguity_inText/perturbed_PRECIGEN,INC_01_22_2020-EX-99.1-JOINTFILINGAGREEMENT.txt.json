                "explanation": "The address for Merck KGaA is changed to 'Unknown'. This creates a contradiction, as the original text clearly states the address. It is now ambiguous whether communication to that address will legally suffice, or if Merck KGaA can claim non-receipt due to incorrect address.",

This introduces ambiguity regarding their authority to sign on behalf of Merck KGaA, as their original titles implied specific financial responsibilities. It is now unclear whether they have the authorization to bind the company to this agreement, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons (as such term is defined in the Schedule 13D referred to below) on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing with the lead Reporting Person (as determined solely by VESA EQUITY INVESTMENT S.À R.L.) on behalf of all signatories of a statement on Schedule 13D (excluding amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting definitions of 'Reporting Persons' and limits the filing to the initial Schedule 13D, excluding amendments. The original text implies all signatories are Reporting Persons with joint filing responsibility for all filings (including amendments), while the modified text grants VESA EQUITY INVESTMENT S.À R.L. sole discretion to determine the 'lead Reporting Person' and restricts joint filing to the original Schedule 13D only. This creates uncertainty about who is responsible for amending the filing and if all signatories will have the authority of reporting person. Furthermore, only the lead reporting person has the responsibility and authority.",

All other parties are responsible only for providing their individual information to VESA EQUITY INVESTMENT S.À R.L. and hold no liability for filing the amendments.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original statement by assigning sole responsibility for filing amendments to VESA EQUITY INVESTMENT S.À R.L. only. The original text stated that each party is responsible for the timely filing of amendments, while the modified text says other parties are ONLY responsible for providing information to VESA EQUITY INVESTMENT S.À R.L., not for the actual filing or its accuracy beyond their individual data. This change introduces ambiguity because one portion assigns responsibility for amendments to each undersigned entity, while the other assigns sole responsibility to a single entity.",

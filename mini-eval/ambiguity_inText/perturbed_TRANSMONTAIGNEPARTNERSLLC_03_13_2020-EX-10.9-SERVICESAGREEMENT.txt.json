                "original_text": "1.1 Provision of Services. EmployeeCo agrees to provide to the Operating Company and its affiliates the Services and such other services as may be determined by the Parties from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 Provision of Services. EmployeeCo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Operating Company and its affiliates the Services and such other services as may be determined by the Operating Company in its sole discretion from time to time.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that EmployeeCo 'agrees to provide' services, which implies a binding obligation. The modified text weakens this obligation to 'commercially reasonable efforts,' creating ambiguity about the required level of performance. Furthermore, it changes the determination of 'other services' from being agreed upon by both parties to being determined solely by the Operating Company, creating a conflict of interest and potentially impacting the scope of services EmployeeCo is obligated to provide.",

All payment obligations hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms, except for obligations related to costs incurred but not yet reimbursed under Section 1.2, which shall be waived upon termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that 'all payment obligations' survive termination. The modified text introduces an exception for 'obligations related to costs incurred but not yet reimbursed under Section 1.2, which shall be waived upon termination.' This creates a direct contradiction regarding the survival of payment obligations, specifically regarding the reimbursement of costs. This could lead to disputes over whether EmployeeCo is entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred before termination.",

The Operating Company shall reimburse EmployeeCo for reasonable direct costs and expenses incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) salaries of the Services Employees;\n\n(b) the cost of employee benefits for the Services Employees, including 401(k), pension, bonuses and health insurance benefits (whether through insurance policies provided by third-parties or self-insurance);\n\n(c) costs associated with workers' compensation claims and other disputes or liabilities associated with the Services Employees, provided such costs are pre-approved by the Operating Company;\n\n(d) severance costs with respect to any terminated Services Employees, but only if such termination was initiated by the Operating Company; and\n\n(e) all sales, use, employment, excise, value added or similar taxes, if any, that may be applicable from time to time with respect to the Services.\n\nSuch reimbursements shall be made by the Operating Company to EmployeeCo within 90 days of EmployeeCo submitting an invoice, unless otherwise agreed between the Operating Company and EmployeeCo.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires reimbursement for 'all direct or indirect costs and expenses.' The modified text limits reimbursement to 'reasonable direct costs,' introduces a requirement for pre-approval for workers' compensation costs, restricts severance reimbursement to terminations initiated by the Operating Company, and changes the payment terms to 90 days after invoicing. This creates several contradictions: what is considered 'reasonable' versus 'all', the Operating Company's control over workers' compensation costs, and the conditions under which severance is reimbursed, conflicting with the initial broad reimbursement obligation.",

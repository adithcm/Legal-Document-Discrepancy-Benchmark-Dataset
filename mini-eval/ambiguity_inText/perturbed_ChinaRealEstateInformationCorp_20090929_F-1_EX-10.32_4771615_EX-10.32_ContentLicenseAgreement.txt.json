                "original_text": "For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") with respect to the Source: CHINA REAL ESTATE INFORMATION CORP, F-1, 9/29/2009 relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the possession, directly or indirectly or as trustee, personal representative or executor, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the affairs or management of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, as trustee, personal representative or executor, by contract, credit arrangement or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") with respect to the relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the possession, directly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the affairs or management of a Person, whether through the ownership of 51% of voting securities. For the purposes of this definition in relation to section 6.4 'Termination for a Change of Control', control means owning more than 50% of the ordinary shares.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'control' is narrowed to only direct possession through 51% ownership of voting securities, conflicting with the broader original definition that includes indirect control and other means. In section 6.4, the meaning of 'control' is different, meaning owing more than 50% of ordinary shares. This introduces ambiguity and makes the term inconsistently defined within the document, which can lead to disputes over control.",

                "original_text": "Licensor shall make available to Licensee the Licensed Content in substantially the same manner and with substantially the same speed and efficiency as such Licensed Content was made available to SINA Leju prior to the Effective Date, namely through Licensor's content database, but in no event with less speed, efficiency, or a lesser level of access than Licensor provides with respect to its own operations.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor shall make reasonable efforts to make available to Licensee the Licensed Content in a manner that is not detrimental to its other business activities. Licensor will decide, in its sole discretion, what is reasonable. The speed and efficiency of access cannot be guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall make available' to 'shall make reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. Furthermore, the added phrase that 'speed and efficiency of access cannot be guaranteed' contradicts the original clause that guaranteed a minimum level of access, leading to conflicting interpretations. 'Reasonable' is also not further defined, which makes it ambiguous.",

Upon expiration of this Agreement or such 90-day period, (i) all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content shall immediately cease, and (ii) Licensee shall immediately discontinue all use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee may, subject to Licensor's approval, use the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content for a period of time, as agreed upon in writing by both parties. The license will continue as long as negotiations in good faith continue with Licensor. After that agreement or negotiation expires, (i) all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content shall cease only after given 30 days notice, and (ii) Licensee shall discontinue all use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content after the 30 days.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a clear 90-day grace period upon termination, while the modified text makes this period conditional on Licensor's approval, creates a contingency for negotiations, and the timing of the discontinuance becomes 30 days after termination or expiration. This makes the licensee's rights after termination unclear, as both parties need to agree, in writing, for the licensed content to be used. ",

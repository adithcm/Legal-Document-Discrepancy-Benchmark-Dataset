                "changed_text": "2.1 Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A shall (i) supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date in compliance with the KGMP, and (ii) manufacture in compliance with general industry standards, but not necessarily in strict conformity with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the \"Product Specifications\"), and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",

The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'general industry standards' instead of strict conformity with the Product Specifications, potentially leading to disputes over acceptable product quality.",

Dong-A shall provide NeuroBo with all available information and technical assistance necessary for NeuroBo to perform the Product Test expeditiously. If the Product Test indicates that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo is deficient in quantity or does not meet the Product Specifications, NeuroBo shall notify Dong-A thereof in writing within the [***]-day period together with results of the Product Test. If the quantity is deficient, Dong-A shall immediately ship the sufficient amount of additional Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to cover the deficiency. If Dong-A does not agree that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, the Parties shall refer their disagreement for decision by an independent testing laboratory agreed by the Parties. The decision by the independent testing laboratory shall be conclusive and binding on both Parties, and the losing Party shall bear the costs of the independent testing laboratory. If Dong-A agrees that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, or if the decision by the testing laboratory confirms that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, (i) Dong-A shall arrange for the return from NeuroBo of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at Dong-A's expense, and (ii) without waiting for the return, Dong-A shall promptly replace the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at no additional cost to NeuroBo.",

It is understood that these Product Test Methods are not binding and are solely for NeuroBo's internal use. If the Product Test, conducted for informational purposes only, indicates potential issues, NeuroBo may, at its discretion, inform Dong-A. If Dong-A agrees to review, Dong-A may ship additional quantity. If the independent test lab result confirms Product Specifications are not met, Dong-A may consider replacing. ",
                "explanation": "The original section establishes a formal process for product testing and recourse if specifications are not met. The altered section makes the testing optional, for internal use only, and weakens the consequences if issues are found. This contradicts the original intent of ensuring product quality and creates uncertainty regarding the criteria for product acceptance.",

Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Dong-A, NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at the exchange rate of the payment date, no later than [***] days prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer",

NeuroBo shall endeavor to pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at a mutually agreeable exchange rate, approximately [***] days after receipt of the invoice by possible methods.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states 'Dong-A shall issue' and 'NeuroBo shall pay,' establishing a binding obligation. The altered text replaces 'shall' with 'may' and 'endeavor to,' weakening the obligation to invoice and pay, and introduces uncertainty regarding the payment timeline and the agreeable exchange rate. These changes create a conflict regarding the payment terms, making them less enforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows termination if RSL Com and affiliates hold LESS than 50% voting control, while the modified text requires them to hold NO voting control at all to trigger termination rights. The definition of Affiliate is also changed to only include directly controlled persons rather than indirect control, which limits how affiliate is defined. This is an in-text contradiction.",

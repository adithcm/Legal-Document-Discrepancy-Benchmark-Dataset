For this purpose, \"control\" of any Person shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, by ownership of voting interest, by contract or otherwise. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) with respect to PennTex Midstream Partners, LLC and its subsidiaries, the term \"Affiliate\" shall exclude Memorial Resource Development Corp. and each of its subsidiaries and (ii) with respect to Memorial Resource Development Corp. and its subsidiaries, the term \"Affiliate\" shall exclude PennTex Midstream Partners, LLC and each of its subsidiaries.",

For this purpose, \"control\" of any Person shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, by ownership of a majority voting interest. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) with respect to PennTex Midstream Partners, LLC and its subsidiaries, the term \"Affiliate\" shall include Memorial Resource Development Corp. and each of its subsidiaries and (ii) with respect to Memorial Resource Development Corp. and its subsidiaries, the term \"Affiliate\" shall include PennTex Midstream Partners, LLC and each of its subsidiaries.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces contradiction in the definition of 'Affiliate'. The original definition excludes specific entities as affiliates, while the modified version includes them. Also, the 'control' is changed from 'ownership of voting interest' to 'ownership of a majority voting interest', thus creating ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "This change provides two different definitions of the same term 'Business Day'. The first relies on the definition within the 'Tariff', creating dependency, while the second offers a direct definition, potentially leading to different interpretations depending on what the Tariff defines 'Business Day' to be.",

                "explanation": "The original section allows for notice via facsimile transmission, which provides proof of delivery. The modified version now allows for email, which provides no guarantee of delivery unless a response is sent. This provides ambiguity because if there's email malfunction or internet outage, it's unclear how that is taken into account.",

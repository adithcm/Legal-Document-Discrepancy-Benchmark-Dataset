During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the \"System Service Warranty\"). In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be quoted by Operator to Owner quarterly for the following quarter, and materials will be invoiced at the retail prices for such materials.",

During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the \"System Service Warranty\"). In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be subject to negotiation between Operator and Owner on a case-by-case basis and materials will be invoiced at a mutually agreed upon price. Operator is not obligated to provide services post the Warranty Period.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated a clear mechanism for services beyond the warranty period: quarterly quotes at retail prices. The modified version introduces ambiguity by making the rates subject to negotiation, which contradicts the initial defined procedure. It also adds that the Operator is not obligated to provide the services which is in contrast of the initial 'clear mechanism'.",

The modified version changes the term to end 21 years after the commencement date, regardless of the Warranty Period of any individual Bloom System, creating a conflict about when the agreement ends.",

The modified version restricts Operator from assigning this agreement to any other party, even if it is an affiliate creating a conflict about assignment rights.",

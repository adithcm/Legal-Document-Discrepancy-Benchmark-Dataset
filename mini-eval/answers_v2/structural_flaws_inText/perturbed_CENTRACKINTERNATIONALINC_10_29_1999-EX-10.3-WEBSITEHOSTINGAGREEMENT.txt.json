                "original_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",

The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees at their discretion and convenience. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the payment schedule ambiguous. By stating fees are paid 'at their discretion and convenience' it directly contradicts the previous, more rigid payment schedule of the '5th day of each month'. This creates uncertainty about when payment is actually due and the repercussions of failing to adhere to a strict deadline. This is an in-text contradiction with the later statement about the consequences of not paying fees in a timely manner.",

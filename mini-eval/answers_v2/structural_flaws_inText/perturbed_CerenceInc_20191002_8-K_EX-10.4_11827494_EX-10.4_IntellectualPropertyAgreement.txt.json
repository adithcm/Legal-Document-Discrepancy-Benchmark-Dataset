                "explanation": "The original text of the definition of \"Intellectual Property Rights\" explicitly excludes contractual rights, including licenses. The modification changes this definition to include contractual rights. This creates a contradiction because later sections of the agreement rely on the original definition to delineate the scope of licensed IP. The inclusion creates an in-text contradiction because Section 5.03 defines that there shall be no implied rights, other than as expressly granted in this agreement, and all other rights under any Intellectual Property Rights licensed to a Party or the members of its Group hereunder are expressly reserved by the Party granting the license. By including contractual rights, including licenses, it implies that the licensor could grant more implicit rights than explicit rights.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Confidential Technical Information\" excludes publicly known information. The modified definition now includes it. This contradicts Section 6.01, which states that all confidential information disclosed under this Agreement shall be deemed confidential and proprietary information, regardless of whether it is publicly known, because it is contradicting the definition that had it be removed if it was publicly known. Now that definition does not hold and has the potential of breaching the confidentiality.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'This Agreement and all rights, interests, and obligations within this Agreement can be assigned to any third party' to the beginning of Section 8.01, which is about no assignment or transfer without consent, creates a direct conflict. The original and remaining text requires prior written consent, but the inserted sentence suggests assignment is freely permissible, even with no consent, creating uncertainty and potentially undermining the intended restrictions on transferability.",

Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party's assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party's assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party's Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, services or other activities of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction."

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because Section 3 defines the exclusive purpose of the Venture as IT Development, internet Back office Maintenance And Deployment of medical Service, while the added sentence allows BorrowMoney.com, inc. to unilaterally change the purpose at any time. This contradicts the original, fixed purpose and creates uncertainty. By adding \"This purpose may be changed at any time at the discretion of BorrowMoney.com, inc.\" a contradiction in terms appears, because first it is said that the purpose is exclusivly something, but with the change it is no longer exclusive, creating incertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause stating each member receives one vote carrying equal weight. The added phrase gives BorrowMoney.com, inc. a vote with double the weight, creating an imbalance of power and directly contravening the initial agreement of equal voting rights. This creates an In-Text Contradiction, because first it says that votes are equal, but the text itself contradicts saying one votes is doubled.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the requirement for unanimous consent to amend the agreement. By stating that the agreement can be amended with only BorrowMoney.com, inc.'s consent, regardless of JVLS, LLC's objections, it nullifies the original clause and creates uncertainty about the amendment process. A contradiction in text appear, because it initially says that for an amendment, there should be an unanymous agreement of the parties, but right after it is said that just one parties consent is sufficient, creating an In-Text Contradiction.",

                "original_text": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be prorated' to 'will be subject to renegotiation', the contract now introduces uncertainty about how the Sponsor's compensation is determined if they serve for less than a full year. Previously, it was clearly defined as prorated. Now, the parties must renegotiate, which could lead to a different outcome than a simple proration. The contradiction is in the determination of the fees to be paid.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty.' The added sentence creates a contradiction by imposing a penalty on the Sponsor if they terminate the agreement within the first year, directly conflicting with the 'without the payment of any penalty' clause. This generates uncertainty as to whether termination is truly 'without penalty'.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Domini is fully responsible for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor, unless otherwise agreed in writing. The changed text contradicts this by limiting Domini's responsibility to the subcontractor's insurance coverage and excluding responsibility for acts outside the scope of the contracted services. This contradicts the original clause of Domini being 'as fully responsible'.",

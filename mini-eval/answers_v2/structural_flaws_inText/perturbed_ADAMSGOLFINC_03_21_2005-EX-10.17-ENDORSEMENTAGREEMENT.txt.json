                "explanation": "This change severely restricts the definition of 'ENDORSEMENT.' Initially, it included various aspects of Consultant's identity. Now, it solely focuses on the name, contradicting later sections where likeness and image are discussed. This contradicts section 3: CONSULTANT hereby gives and grants to ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right and license to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT in the CONTRACT TERRITORY.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that the consultant may use any clubs at his discretion, including those from competitors. It also states that he may endorse those clubs and/or putter. This directly contradicts section 4A, 4B and 4C, which explicitly prohibit Consultant from endorsing products made or sold by any other manufacturer or seller.",

BASE COMPENSATION For the entire term of this Agreement, from September 1, 2004 through [*****] ADAMS GOLF may pay CONSULTANT a base compensation of up to [*****] dollars. The actual base compensation shall be determined annually based on Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion. No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation changes the mandatory 'shall pay' to discretionary 'may pay' regarding the base compensation, contradicting the certainty established. This contradicts section 19A where the consultant is entitled to bonuses based on performance, making it unclear if the consultant is even entitled to a base salary. The change from a fixed base compensation to one that depends on 'Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion' creates ambiguity about the financial obligations of Adams Golf and directly contradicts the expectation in section 19 that bonuses will be *in addition* to the base compensation.",

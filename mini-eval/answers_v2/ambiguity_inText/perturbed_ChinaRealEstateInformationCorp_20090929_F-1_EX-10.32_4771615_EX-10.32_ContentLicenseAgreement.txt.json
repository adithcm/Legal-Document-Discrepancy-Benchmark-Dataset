                "changed_text": "\"Business\" means an online real estate media platform in the PRC that (i) provides information and updates strictly limited to new residential real estate projects in tier 1 cities only, and exclusively provides advertising services for these projects, and (ii) operates a business-to-consumer Internet platform strictly targeting individual buyers of new residential properties in tier 1 cities.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by restricting the definition of 'Business' to focus solely on new residential real estate projects in tier 1 cities, departing from the original broader definition encompassing real estate, home furnishing, construction, and business-to-business platforms across the PRC. This creates an in-text contradiction if other clauses in the contract refer to the 'Business' in its original, broader sense, particularly concerning content distribution and service scope in Article III.",

                "contradicted_text": "ARTICLE III QUALITY CONTROL 3.1. Licensee Control. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee shall be entitled to exercise exclusive control over all aspects of the websites and the Business associated with the Licensed Domain Names including, without limitation, the operation, the look-and- feel and the Content of such websites. 3.2. Content Distribution. Licensor shall make available to Licensee the Licensed Content in substantially the same manner and with substantially the same speed and efficiency as such Licensed Content was made available to SINA Leju prior to the Effective Date, namely through Licensor's content database, but in no event with less speed, efficiency, or a lesser level of access than Licensor provides with respect to its own operations. Licensee agrees to use the Licensed Domain Names only in accordance with such content distribution policy that Licensor uses in connection with its own business, and as may be established by Licensor and communicated in writing in advance to Licensee from time to time or as may otherwise be agreed to by the Parties from time to time, provided that Licensee shall be afforded the same period of time to implement any such content distribution policy as is afforded to Licensor's Affiliates and other third parties. 3.3. Website Monitoring and Censoring. (a) Licensee Obligations. Licensee shall monitor and censor all Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including without limitation Content posted by end users. Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee's failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. (b) New Restrictions Imposed by Governmental Authority. In the event Licensor receives notice from any Governmental Authority that the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names contain offending Content where (i) the basis or nature of such offense has not previously been identified by any Governmental Authority as offensive or inappropriate and (ii) Licensee has not also received notice from such Governmental Authority, Licensor shall promptly notify Licensee of Licensor's receipt thereof. Licensee shall then use best efforts to remove such Content as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions of such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in Section 8.2 to the contrary, in the event Licensor fails to notify Licensee of Licensor's receipt of such notice from a Governmental Authority, such that Licensee does not have sufficient time to remove such offending Content, Licensee shall not be liable for any fines or penalties imposed by a Governmental Authority in connection with such offending Content. 3.4. Compliance with Laws. Licensee shall ensure that the Business complies with all applicable Laws in respect of operation, advertising and promotion of the Business and use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content in connection therewith. 3.5. Restrictions. Except as expressly permitted under the Trademark License Agreement, Licensee shall not knowingly (a) use the Licensed Domain Names in any manner that tarnishes, degrades, disparages or reflects adversely on Licensor or Licensor's business or reputation, (b) in any jurisdiction, register or attempt to register any domain names that consist of, in whole or in part, or are confusingly similar to, the term \"SINA\", (c) contest, challenge or otherwise make any claim or take any action adverse to Licensor's interest in the Licensed Domain Names, (d) register any trademarks, trade names or company names that consist of, in whole or in part, or are confusingly similar to the term \"SINA\" in the name of Licensee or of any of its Affiliates, or (e) use the Licensed Content and other Content for any unlawful purpose, including but not limited to displaying or distributing any pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit material, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials. In the event that Licensor reasonably determines that any violation of the foregoing by Licensee poses an immediate harm to Licensor's business, reputation or goodwill, Licensee shall promptly, following receipt of notice from Licensor, cease and desist all such non-conforming uses."

(b) Licensee shall reasonably cooperate with Licensor in any action, suit or proceeding that the Licensor may undertake under this Section 5.1 (including, without limitation, executing, filing and delivering all documents and evidence reasonably requested by the Licensor) and shall lend its name to such action, suit or proceeding if reasonably requested by the Licensor or required by applicable Law. All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Licensee in connection therewith shall be reimbursed by the Licensor. The Licensee shall have the right to participate and be represented in any such action, suit or proceeding by its own counsel at its own expense. (c) All damages or other compensation of any kind recovered in any action, suit or proceeding undertaken under this Article V, or from any settlement or compromise thereof, shall be for the benefit of the Licensor, provided, however, that any compensation granted or awarded in light of any losses incurred by Licensee shall be for the benefit of the Licensee after Licensor's reasonable expenses for taking such action, suit or proceeding have been paid."

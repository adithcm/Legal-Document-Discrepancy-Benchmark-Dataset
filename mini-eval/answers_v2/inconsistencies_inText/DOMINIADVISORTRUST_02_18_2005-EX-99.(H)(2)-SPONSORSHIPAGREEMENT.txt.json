Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",

However, Section 3 states that the Trust will pay Domini a fee for the services rendered. This is contradictory regarding who is responsible for paying the Sponsor fees, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information."

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that a penalty of $10,000 is required for termination. This directly conflicts with the initial statement in the same section that termination can occur 'without the payment of any penalty,' causing uncertainty and potential disputes about termination penalties.",

This Agreement may be terminated at any time, with the payment of a penalty of $10,000, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party."

The original clause states that Domini is fully responsible for its subcontractors' actions unless the Trust agrees otherwise in writing. The added sentence negates that responsibility entirely, creating ambiguity and conflicting obligations regarding liability for subcontractors' actions. This is contradictory and has legal and financial ramifications.",

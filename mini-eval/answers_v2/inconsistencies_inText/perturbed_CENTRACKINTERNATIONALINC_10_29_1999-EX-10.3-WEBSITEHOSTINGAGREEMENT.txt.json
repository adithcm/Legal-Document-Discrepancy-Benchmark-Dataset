The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the payment due date from the 5th to the 20th of each month. This contradicts the original payment terms and creates uncertainty regarding when late fees or service interruptions would apply. This creates an in-text contradiction with the original text by modifying the deadline for payment. This creates ambiguity in which payment terms are to be followed.",

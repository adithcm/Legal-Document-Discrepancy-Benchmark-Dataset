                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying a milestone-based payment schedule instead of a single payment upon completion of the Scope of Work. This directly contradicts the original payment terms, leading to confusion about when the remaining $3,100 is due.",

Client agrees to pay to Company the sum of $5,000 (the \"Contract Price\") to design and develop a website for Client (the \"Client Website\") in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. (a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". The costs of any such changes shall be added to the Contract Price. Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.

Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client. (c) Client Submitted Content. All written content submitted by Client for use in the Client Website must be typewritten, proofread and delivered to Company in the body of an email message or as a Microsoft Word electronic document or plaint text electronic document. Any content submitted by Client in any other manner or format, including, but not limited to Adobe PDF format, will be returned to Client for resubmission. Company will not make any attempt to proof read or correct any contextual, grammatical or typographical errors in the written content submitted by Client. It is Client's sole responsibility to check the accuracy of the written content and correct any errors prior to submission for final publication. Company will assume that all the written content submitted by Client has been proofread and is ready for publication. Client may elect to pay Company the Hourly Rate set forth below to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above. (d) Company License and Credit. Client hereby grants to Company a non-exclusive and limited license to use Client's trade names, logos and other trademarks in connection with Company advertising, marketing and promotion of its products and services. Client agrees that any unsolicited positive feedback Client provides to Company may be used in any Company marketing and/or advertising materials (i.e., customer testimonials).

                "explanation": "By adding 'however the partnership name will be Vaccines2Go' it creates confusion about which name represents the actual venture in legal and operational contexts. This directly contradicts subsequent references to the venture using 'BM&V2GO' in the agreement, creating uncertainty and a potential legal dispute about the entity's identity.",

                "explanation": "Reducing BorrowMoney.com, inc's capital contribution from $3,500,000.00 to $3,500.00 creates a significant imbalance in capital contributions between the members. This directly contradicts section 38 which stipulates distribution of liquidation assets will be made in proportion to capital accounts. This perturbation creates financial ambiguity and potential disputes during the Venture's dissolution.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise decided by BorrowMoney.com inc.' gives BorrowMoney.com, inc unilateral power over management voting.

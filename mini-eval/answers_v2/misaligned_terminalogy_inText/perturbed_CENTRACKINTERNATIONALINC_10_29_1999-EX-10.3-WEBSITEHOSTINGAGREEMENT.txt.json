A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites. The term \"Hosted Site\" shall mean the Web site of the Customer that is hosted by i-on under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",

A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites. The term \"Hosted Site\" shall mean the online portal of the Customer that is hosted by i-on under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Web site\" is changed from a \"computer system\" to \"a collection of interconnected webpages.\" Also the definition of \"Hosted Site\" is changed from the Web Site of the customer to the online portal of the customer. This creates a contradiction because later in the agreement, the document refers to the \"Hosted Site\" in the context of computer storage and hardware maintenance. Changing 'Web site' to interconnected webpages means that this definition will be innacurate for other segments of the contract.",

                "explanation": "The term \"Customer\" is replaced with \"subscriber\" for one instance. This introduces ambiguity as to who is responsible for payments, creating an in-text contradiction with other locations where only 'Customer' is mentioned.

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Customer\" to \"Client\" creates a misaligned terminology. The contradiction lies in the fact that it's not defined if \"Client\" is the same as \"Customer\".

                "explanation": "The original text defines 'ENDORSEMENT' broadly for marketing and sales. The changed text restricts 'ENDORSEMENT' to only internal documentation. This contradicts later sections (e.g., Section 3) that rely on the broader definition for promotional activities.",

However, the modification allows the consultant to disregard public morals if they believe it will bring additional media attention to ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. This creates an in-text contradiction, as it suggests that negative publicity is an acceptable exception to the clause requiring the CONSULTANT to maintain an acceptable behavior.",

If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT: A.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude, B.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community, D.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT. ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination."

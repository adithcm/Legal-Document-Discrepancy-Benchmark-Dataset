                "explanation": "The change from 'Company' to 'Service Provider' introduces ambiguity. While they might be intended to be the same, later sections refer to 'Company' without explicitly stating it's interchangeable with 'Service Provider'. This could lead to disputes over which entity is responsible for specific obligations, since a number of clauses name the term 'Company' when defining obligations. This creates uncertainty and could be interpreted in favor of one party, or another depending on the interpretation.",

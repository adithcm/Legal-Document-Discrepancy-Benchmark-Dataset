Duties of the Sponsor.

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall perform' to 'may perform' introduces uncertainty regarding the Sponsor's mandatory duties. The original text imposes a clear obligation for the Sponsor to provide certain services, while the altered text makes these services optional. This contradiction arises specifically in Section 1. Duties of the Sponsor, creating ambiguity about the Sponsor's required responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall not be responsible' to 'shall also be fully responsible,' there's now a direct contradiction concerning the Sponsor's responsibility for managing the Trust's assets. The original text explicitly states the Sponsor is *not* responsible, whereas the changed text makes them *fully* responsible, creating a conflicting obligation within the same paragraph. Specifically, the introductory phrase is now in direct conflict with the 'nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed' phrase.",

                "explanation": "By replacing the specific T1 line and UUNET details with a vague reference to a 'separate service level agreement (SLA),' this change creates an in-text contradiction if no SLA is actually provided or if other sections of the agreement still refer to the original connectivity specifications. This omission introduces uncertainty as the connectivity type is no longer defined in this agreement. The services provided are no longer clearly defined, which directly impacts the enforcement of the contract.",

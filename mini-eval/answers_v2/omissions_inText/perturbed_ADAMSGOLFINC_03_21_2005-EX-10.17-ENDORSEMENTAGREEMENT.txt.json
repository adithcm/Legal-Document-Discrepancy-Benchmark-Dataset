                "explanation": "The definition of 'PRODUCT' has been narrowed by removing 'iron-woods, utility clubs, wedges, bags, and headwear'. This creates a contradiction because Section 5 states that CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT and later paragraphs state which golf clubs and headwear that the CONSULTANT must exclusively use. By removing these product in the definition, it creates an in-text contradiction with Section 5, which mentions CONSULTANT's exclusive use of 'PRODUCT', but now the definition of product is missing some of the items.",

CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the MANDATORY PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement. It is agreed that if the contract is terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the compensation due CONSULTANT shall be prorated from the date this Agreement is terminated.

Proration of compensation shall be determined on the same repayment schedule as provide in paragraph 8A below.' has been removed. This creates an in-text contradiction because the contract now lacks clarity on how compensation is handled if the agreement is terminated under this specific condition. The term 'repayment schedule' is referenced in paragraph 22 and 23, creating an internal contradiction since the proration repayment method is not explained in this section anymore. This creates uncertainty and ambiguity in enforcement.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A."

The removal of this sentence introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction with the practice outlined in paragraph 6. Removing that explicit allowance of non-Adams Golf products creates uncertainty. Paragraph 6 mentions situations where the CONSULTANT endorses or promotes a non-competitive product, and in that endorsement the CONSULTANT wears a product that would be considered a product, he shall use the ADAM GOLF product, meaning that it would contradict this clause, as the original clause said the consultant can use other products as long as its not an endorsment for the product.",

When endorsing a non-competitive product, under no circumstances shall CONSULTANT wear, play, use, hold or in any way be associated with an ADAMS GOLF competitor's Product."

Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust, which shall include without limitation: (a) maintaining office facilities (which may be in the office of Domini or an affiliate) and furnishing clerical services necessary for maintaining the organization of the Trust and for performing the oversight, administrative and management functions herein set forth; (b) arranging, if desired by the Trust, for directors, officers or employees of the Sponsor to serve as Trustees, officers or agents of the Trust if duly elected or appointed to such positions and subject to their individual consent and to any limitations imposed by law; (c) supervising the overall administration of the Trust, including the updating of corporate organizational documents, and the negotiation of contracts and fees with and the monitoring and coordinating of performance and billings of the Trust's transfer agent, shareholder servicing agents (if any), custodian, administrator, subadministrator (if any) and other independent contractors or agents; (d) overseeing (with advice of the Trust's counsel) the preparation of and, if applicable, filing all documents required for compliance by the Trust with applicable laws and regulations (including state \"blue sky\" laws and regulations), including registration statements on Form N-1A, prospectuses and statements of additional information, or similar forms, as applicable, semi-annual and annual reports to shareholders and proxy statements, and reviewing tax returns; (e) preparation of agendas and supporting documents for and minutes of meetings of Trustees, committees of Trustees and preparation of notices, proxy statements and minutes of meetings of shareholders; (f) arranging for maintenance of books and records of the Trust; (g) maintaining telephone coverage to respond to shareholder inquiries regarding matters to which this Agreement pertains to which the transfer agent is unable to respond; (h) providing reports and assistance regarding each series' compliance with securities and tax laws and each series' investment objectives; (i) arranging for dissemination of yield and other performance information to newspapers and tracking services; (j) arranging for and preparing annual renewals for fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance coverage; (k) developing a budget for the Trust, establishing the rate of expense accruals and arranging for the payment of all fixed and management expenses; and (l) answering questions from the general public, the media and investors in the Trust regarding (i) the securities holdings of the Trust; (ii) any limits in which the Trust invests; (iii) the social investment philosophy of the Trust; and (iv) the proxy voting philosophy and shareholder activism philosophy of the Trust.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit list of duties, and specifically sections (d) overseeing regulatory compliance, (h) providing reports on compliance, and (k) developing a budget, the modified text contradicts the implication in Section 2 that the Trust has defined responsibilities regarding expenses like SEC fees and reporting costs. The omission creates uncertainty as to who is responsible for these crucial tasks. While it states that it includes 'maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust.' this is ambigious in terms of responsibilites and accountabilities.",

For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific rate of 0.50% and the reference to the Trust's average daily net assets, the modified text creates an in-text contradiction with Section 2. Section 2 mentions 'fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement,' implying a defined calculation method, while the modified Section 3 only states a 'mutually agreed upon fee,' leaving the calculation method undefined. This makes enforcement ambiguous, as there's no clear way to determine if the agreed-upon fee is legitimate as the original agreement implies that the fees paid should match the methodology in which the original rate was meant to be caculated with. Now it contradicts the initial intention of the text.",

This contradicts Section 1, which states that Domini's duties are 'Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust', by removing the requirement for trustee approval, Domini is no longer fully subjected to the direction and control of the board.",

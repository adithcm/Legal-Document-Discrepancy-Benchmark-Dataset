        "section": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'the Trust's then current fiscal year' is ambiguous because it's unclear whether the 0.50% is calculated at the beginning, during, or end of the fiscal year. This is a discrepancy because it does not clearly define how the fee is calculated.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The text states that termination can occur 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty' but then contradicts itself in the following sentence stating 'termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.'",

Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "The contradiction lies in limiting Domini's responsibility to the subcontractor's liability insurance coverage and then stating Domini isn't responsible for acts outside the scope of contracted services. The ambiguity is that the contract does not state whether Domini would be responsible for anything not covered by the subcontactor's liability insurance.",

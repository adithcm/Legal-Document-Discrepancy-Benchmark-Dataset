        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "This definition of \"Endorsement\" is extremely narrow, essentially rendering it almost useless. It contradicts the general understanding of what an endorsement entails, which typically includes the use of likeness, image, etc. This creates an in-text contradiction because the rest of the agreement refers to \"CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT\" as something of value, yet this definition severely restricts its scope.",

He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This clause states that Consultant may use any clubs he desires, but also mentions 'MANDATORY PRODUCT'. This creates a contradiction, as mandatory products means that consultant is required to use them, however, it also states that consultant is encouraged to use the mandatory product whenever feasible. This implies that consultant does not have to use these products, which contradicts the terminology.",

The actual base compensation shall be determined annually based on Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion. No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.",
        "explanation": "The initial statement suggests ADAMS GOLF 'may pay' a base compensation. Then it follows by stating 'No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon', this contradicts the first statment as it implies that base compensation is determined annually based on ADAMS GOLF's financial performance. Thus, the two sentences undermine each other.",

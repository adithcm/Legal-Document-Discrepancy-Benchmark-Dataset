        "explanation": "The initial statement guarantees continuous operation, while the subsequent clause permits maintenance without notice. This creates ambiguity as the definition of 'continuous' is undermined by the allowance for unscheduled interruptions, which contradicts the initial promise of constant availability.",

        "explanation": "The term mentions that the customer has 30 days to pay the invoice, however it mentions 'failure to pay such fees in a timely manner may result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site'. This is misaligned as it does not define the term 'timely manner', as if they have 30 days to pay, that is in a timely manner. The failure to define 'timely manner' is misaligned with the amount of time provided to pay the invoices.",

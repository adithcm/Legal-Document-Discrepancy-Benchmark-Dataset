        "section": "The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction in the allocation of legal counsel fees. It first states that the Trust is responsible for *all* operating expenses. Then it creates an exception where Domini will cover legal counsel fees which means the trust should NOT be covering them. This causes an inconsistency on who exactly is responsible for legal fees and will cause disputes as to who will cover them.",

        "explanation": "The contradiction lies in the combination of allowing termination 'at any time' while simultaneously requiring 'not less than 60 days' written notice' and 'payment of a penalty of $10,000'. If termination is truly at 'any time', there would be no notice period. The $10,000 is considered a penalty and should not be there. The phrase 'at any time' creates uncertainty about whether parties are obligated to follow notice periods and pay the penalty if they elect to terminate the contract.",

        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction and raises concerns around accountability and standard of care and means that the Trustees cannot seek any recourse from Domini as the Sponsor. While subcontracting is permitted, it introduces a potential conflict of interest and allows Domini to absolve itself of responsibility for services it is contracted to provide. The contract states that Domini is not responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor. As the trustee can not hold Domini liable for misconduct, the structural flaw in the legal terms means that it does not make sense.",

Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue From Awarded Contract, In Addition to The Total Contributions.' The phrase 'In Addition to The Total Contributions' is ambiguous. It's unclear whether the 10% revenue share is in addition to the initial $60,000 contribution, or in addition to a later defined 'Total Contributions' amount.",

Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue, In Addition to The Total Contributions. $3,500,000.00 USD'. This implies that the initial $60,000 investment, plus 10% of revenue, is somehow equivalent to $3,500,000, which is highly improbable and lacks any clear logical basis. The 10% revenue cannot equal 3.5M USD. It's misaligned terminology.",

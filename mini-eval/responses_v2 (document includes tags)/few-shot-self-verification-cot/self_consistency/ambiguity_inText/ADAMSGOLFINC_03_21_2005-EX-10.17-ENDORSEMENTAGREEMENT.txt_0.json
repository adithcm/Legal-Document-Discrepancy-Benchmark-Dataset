        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. This excludes use of likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
        "explanation": "This definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is ambiguous because it limits the use of the Consultant's name to marketing materials directly created by Adams Golf but excludes likeness or image use for promotional events unless separately agreed upon. This creates an in-text contradiction because it suggests that marketing materials *can* use the Consultant's name but promotional events *cannot* use likeness/image without further agreement. This implies name usage and likeness/image usage are distinct when the former could easily involve or imply the latter, especially if the marketing material includes a photo of the consultant. What is considered marketing material versus promotional event is too vague, causing potential disputes on permissible use of consultant's name and image.",

        "explanation": "This creates an internal contradiction. First, the clause states the Consultant \"shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT.\" Then, it directly contradicts that statement by saying the Consultant \"is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction.\" The provision for a \"good faith effort\" does not resolve the contradiction because it's impossible to exclusively use Adams Golf's mandatory products while simultaneously being unrestricted in using any manufacturer's products. It's ambiguous which statement controls or what \"good faith effort\" practically entails when a contractual obligation of exclusivity exists. This undermines the entire purpose of the endorsement agreement.",

        "section": "B. During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his discretion, participate in television and radio commercials, photo shoots, modeling, and promotional appearances. ADAMS GOLF shall reimburse CONSULTANT for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances. Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation.",
        "explanation": "This section contains inconsistent obligations. It states Adams Golf will reimburse reasonable travel expenses \"when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph.\" However, the first sentence states the Consultant's participation is \"at his discretion.\" If the appearances are at the Consultant's discretion, it is unclear how they are pursuant to \"this paragraph\". This creates an ambiguity regarding when Adams Golf is obligated to cover travel expenses if the consultant's appearance is entirely discretionary. Does \"special appearance\" mean the same as the promotional appearances outlined in 11.A?",

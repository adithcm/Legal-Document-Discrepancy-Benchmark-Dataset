        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This clause attempts to eliminate the standard of care typically afforded to investment advisors and managers. Imposing full liability for *any* error of judgment or mistake of law, even without negligence, is extremely unusual and likely unenforceable under applicable laws governing investment company management. It contradicts the typical standard which requires some level of culpability (negligence, bad faith, etc.) for liability to attach. This creates a legal contradiction because courts generally don't enforce contract provisions that violate public policy or established legal standards of care.",

        "explanation": "This clause creates an ambiguity in text, as the phrase 'with the payment of a penalty equal to one year of the average management fees collected over the prior three years' is a contridiction. There is no valid definition of 'penalty' in this case, leading to the interpretation that the penalty is the same as fees collected over the prior three years.",

        "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding the Sponsor's responsibility. Initially, Domini is contracted to provide oversight, administrative, and management services. However, this clause allows Domini to subcontract these duties without the Trustees' approval of the subcontractor's qualifications and significantly limits Domini's liability for the subcontractor's actions to cases of gross negligence. This creates a loophole where the Trust may receive substandard services from an unqualified subcontractor, with limited recourse against Domini, directly conflicting with Domini's original duty to provide these services competently.",

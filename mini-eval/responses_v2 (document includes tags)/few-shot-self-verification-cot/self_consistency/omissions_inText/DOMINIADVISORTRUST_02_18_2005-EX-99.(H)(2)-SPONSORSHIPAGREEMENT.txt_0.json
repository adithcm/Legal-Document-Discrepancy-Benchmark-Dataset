        "section": "1. Duties of the Sponsor. Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The description of services provided is extremely broad and open-ended ('as requested by the Trust'). While it states the Sponsor performs services 'subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees', the lack of specific definition creates ambiguity. The phrase 'These services include but are not limited to' suggests the Sponsor could be required to undertake a wide range of tasks. This ambiguity becomes a potential in-text contradiction because Section 2 then allocates expenses to the Trust, including fees due the Sponsor. The lack of clarity on the Sponsor's duties makes it difficult to determine if those fees are justified or if the Trust is paying for services not clearly defined or agreed upon.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'mutually agreed upon fee' in Section 3 introduces ambiguity. While it suggests both parties must agree, it doesn't specify *when* or *how* this agreement occurs. It is unclear if this fee is set annually, per service, or some other method. Furthermore, it says that 'If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement', this statement is ambiguous because it does not give an explanation as to what is going to happen if there is no mutual agreement.",

        "section": "7. Subcontracting by Domini. Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons.",
        "explanation": "This clause is ambiguous because it does not include if Domini needs the Trust's approval before subcontracting the work. This introduces the possibility of the Sponsor delegating its core responsibilities to a third party without the Trust's knowledge or consent. Since the Trust is paying the Sponsor, this subcontracting clause creates uncertainty and conflicts with the implication that the Trust is contracting directly with Domini for its specific expertise and oversight.",

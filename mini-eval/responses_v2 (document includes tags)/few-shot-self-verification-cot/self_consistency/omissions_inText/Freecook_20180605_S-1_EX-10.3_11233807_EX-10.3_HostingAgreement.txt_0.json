        "section": "Client agrees to pay to Company to design and develop a website for Client (the \"Client Website\") in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. (a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Additional Work' is ambiguous. It includes 'changes to elements which have been finalized,' but it doesn't define what constitutes finalization or who determines when an element is finalized. This lack of clarity can lead to disagreements about whether a change qualifies as Additional Work and thus incurs extra charges.",

Any content submitted by Client in any other manner or format, including, but not limited to Adobe PDF format, will be returned to Client for resubmission. Company will not make any attempt to proof read or correct any contextual, grammatical or typographical errors in the written content submitted by Client. It is Client's sole responsibility to check the accuracy of the written content and correct any errors prior to submission for final publication. Company will assume that all the written content submitted by Client has been proofread and is ready for publication. Client may elect to pay Company to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction in Company's responsibilities. While the company will not make any attempt to proof read and correct any errors, but if the client decides to pay Company to type and proofread, then Company takes on the responsibility of proof reading and correcting. However, the condition under which the company must type and proofread is under specified format. There is an ambiguity in whether the company should have the client re-submit the information or if the company does not have this right. ",

The surcharge for rush work shall be the hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%).",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%)' is vague because the actual hourly rate is not specified anywhere in the agreement. This omission creates a significant ambiguity, making it impossible to determine the exact cost of rush work. The ambiguity could lead to the business charging the client an hourly rate the client is not okay with, leading to a dispute.",

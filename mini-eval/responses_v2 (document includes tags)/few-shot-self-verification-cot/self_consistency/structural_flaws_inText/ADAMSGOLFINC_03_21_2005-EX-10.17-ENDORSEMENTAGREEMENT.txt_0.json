        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "This definition of \"Endorsement\" is extremely narrow.  It allows Adams Golf to use Tom Watson's *name* only.  However, section 3, \"CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT\", grants Adams Golf the \"exclusive right and license to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT\". The contradiction lies in the limited definition versus the broad right granted.  If the \"ENDORSEMENT\" only allows the *name* to be used, the section 3 is structurally flawed because advertising/promotion typically uses more than just a name to promote a product.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his sole discretion, use any golf clubs he desires, including those from competitors. He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section contradicts the definition of \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" in Section 2.C, which states that the Consultant *must* exclusively play/use the specified Adams Golf products in all SPGA/PGA events. Section 5 provides Consultant the discretion to use any clubs, creating a direct conflict. It makes the meaning of 'Mandatory Products' not mandatory. This is not only an in-text contradiction but is also an structural flaw as it makes no sense to define mandatory products if the Consultant does not have to use them",

        "section": "18. BASE COMPENSATION For the entire term of this Agreement, from September 1, 2004 through [*****] ADAMS GOLF may pay CONSULTANT a base compensation of up to [*****] dollars. The actual base compensation shall be determined annually based on Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion. No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.",
        "explanation": "This section presents contradictory conditions regarding the Consultant's base compensation. Firstly, it states that Adams Golf *may* pay a base compensation of *up to* a certain amount, which implies the payment is not guaranteed. Then, it states that the base compensation is determined *at their sole discretion*, suggesting Adams Golf can decide to pay any amount within the specified limit or none at all. Finally, it is stated that *no compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon*. This creates a contradiction because if the compensation is determined at Adams Golf's sole discretion, then a mutual agreement would not matter. It makes the Consultant have no control on how much compensation is being paid, essentially making the compensation payment optional.",

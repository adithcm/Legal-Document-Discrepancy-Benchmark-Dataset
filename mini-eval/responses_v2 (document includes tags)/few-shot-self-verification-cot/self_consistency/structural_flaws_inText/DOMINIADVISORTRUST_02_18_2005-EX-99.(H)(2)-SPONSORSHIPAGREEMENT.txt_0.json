        "section": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the compensation that the Trust shall pay Domini for services rendered. By only addressing the fee structure for Domini serving less than the entire period, the lack of a description for the fee structure of when Domini serves the whole period creates a structural flaw. This means that the text implies it is subject to negotiation.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that termination can occur \"at any time without any penalty\", whereas the second sentence states that the sponsor will be subject to penalty fees. This creates ambiguity in the condition of the agreement.",

Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section limits Domini's liability for subcontractor actions to the subcontractor's insurance coverage and excludes responsibility for actions outside the contracted services. By Domini excluding responsibility to these subcontractors, a loophole is created where a legal protection is taken away.",

The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees at their discretion and convenience. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The second sentence which states 'The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees at their discretion and convenience' directly contradicts the first sentence, which specifies a fixed amount ($450). If the customer could pay at their discretion, they could pay an amount lower than $450, however, the amount is clearly defined, so there is no discretion. This contradiction creates confusion about the payment amount and terms.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon fifteen (15) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The original clause specifies a fixed six-month term. The modified text introduces an automatic renewal clause for one month. The two termination clauses also create a contradiction. First, 'unless earlier terminated in accordance with provisions hereof' and the later sentence stating 'Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon fifteen (15) days' written notice.' These two contradict each other because they provide different methods of termination during the intial six month term, thus the first initial agreement of six months is invalid.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'i-on will be liable under any circumstances for any lost profits or other consequential damages, even if i-on has been advised as to the possibility of such damages' contradicts the second sentence 'i-on's liability for damages to the Customer for any cause whatsoever, regardless of the form of action, and whether in contract or in tort, including negligence, shall be limited to one (1) month's fees and the remaining portion of any prepaid fees.' This is because the first sentence states that there is a liability for damages, where as the second phrase limits that. They cannot both be true.",

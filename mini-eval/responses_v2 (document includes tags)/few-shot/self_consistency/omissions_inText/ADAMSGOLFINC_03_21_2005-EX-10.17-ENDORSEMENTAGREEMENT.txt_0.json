        "explanation": "The definition of \"PRODUCT\" is broad, encompassing all golf clubs. However, Section 4D allows the CONSULTANT to endorse and play [*****]. This creates a potential conflict if the [*****] is considered a golf club under the definition of \"PRODUCT,\" thus violating the exclusivity clause.",

        "explanation": "This clause mandates exclusive use of MANDATORY PRODUCTS, but Section 7 allows the CONSULTANT to notify ADAMS GOLF if the MANDATORY PRODUCT is unsuitable. If ADAMS GOLF cannot provide suitable replacements, the agreement might be terminated. This contradicts the absolute exclusivity implied in Section 5 because, in practice, the consultant can reject the mandatory product. This clause is not enforceable as written, because the CONSULTANT could state all products are unsiutable and get out of the contract without having to do anything.",

Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement.",
        "explanation": "Consultant's satisfaction must be in 'his sincere best reasonable judgement'. This means that ADAMS GOLF cannot determine whether the product is suitable, but rather the consultant is the sole determiner. This would be structural flaw, because if the consultant states that the product is not up to his standards, then it will result in the termination of the agreement.",

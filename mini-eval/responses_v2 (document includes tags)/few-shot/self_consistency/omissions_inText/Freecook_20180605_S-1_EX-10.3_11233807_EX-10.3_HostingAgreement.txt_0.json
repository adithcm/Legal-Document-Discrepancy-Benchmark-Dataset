(a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "The term 'Additional Work' is being used interchangeably within the same section without a clear and consistent definition. It refers to 'changes to the Scope of Work requiring Additional Work', which creates a circular reference and makes it difficult to determine what constitutes 'Additional Work' and what doesn't.",

Any content submitted by Client in any other manner or format, including, but not limited to Adobe PDF format, will be returned to Client for resubmission. Company will not make any attempt to proof read or correct any contextual, grammatical or typographical errors in the written content submitted by Client. It is Client's sole responsibility to check the accuracy of the written content and correct any errors prior to submission for final publication. Company will assume that all the written content submitted by Client has been proofread and is ready for publication. Client may elect to pay Company to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above.",
        "explanation": "The clause mentions that the 'Client may elect to pay Company to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above.' However, it doesn't specify the fees or the process. This makes it hard to know how much client may pay company in order to type and proofread the written content.",

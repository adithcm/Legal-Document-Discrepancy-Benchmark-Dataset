        "explanation": "There are multiple misalignments that cause contradictions here. First, the term 'Total Contributions' is used for JVLS, LLC without defining what it encompasses; it could be the initial investment, or some other metric, creating confusion. Also, BorrowMoney.com's duties are described in detail, including employee assignments, while JVLS, LLC's responsibilities are primarily financial, plus 10% of any generated gross revenue. This is an in-text misalignment and contradiction, as one is providing a service while the other is paying a sum and also contributing part of revenue. Finally, the description of BorrowMoney.com, inc mentions *HTML code, build, deploy and maintain all technical aspect requirements including a database for medical dispatch personal & product service as needed, including activity information, data storage and backup.' However, the description that its 'provided by three qualified assigned Borrowmoney.com, inc. employees/personal' does not seem to align.",

First, BorrowMoney.com, inc's contribution is listed as '1,500 square feet of Leased/rent office Space Includingspecified Description of duty*', however the description of duty is not present. Also, JVLS, LLC's description includes '+ (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue, In Add i t i on to The To ta l Contributions', but this is already mentioned earlier on. Finally, the agreed value for both parties is $3,500,000.00, which indicates that JVLS, LLC's capital contribution is mostly in generated gross revenue, rather than actual revenue at the moment.",

A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture.

        "explanation": "The original text specifies that the value of the venture will be determined based on 'total revenue generated over the last 3 months' if there is no written agreement. The text then says that an appraiser will be appointed in a reasonable period, which creates an ambiguity as to when they will be appointed. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture, but there is no specification of what the value of the Venture should be.",

        "section": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",
        "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding when the compensation is determined. In the original text, the agreement stated that 'if Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation'. In the changed text, it omits the word 'renegotiation' and replaces it with 'appropriate', creating a contradiction.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the termination penalties. It appears that there are no penalties if the Board of Trustees terminates the agreement at any time, without the payment of any penalty. But that the Sponsor will receive a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee. This makes it unequal for both parties.",

        "explanation": "The original text 'Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons' indicates that all responsibilities will be passed onto the subcontractor. However, the changed text 'to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage' will only hold the subcontractor accountable up to the extent of their own coverage, and 'Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services', this will absolve Domini for a lot of responsibilities that the trust is paying for.",

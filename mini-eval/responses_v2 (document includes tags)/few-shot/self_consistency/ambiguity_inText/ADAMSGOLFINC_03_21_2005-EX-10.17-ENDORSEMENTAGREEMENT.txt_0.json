        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. This excludes use of likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
        "explanation": "This section defines \"ENDORSEMENT\" as limited to using the consultant's name. However, section 3 then grants ADAMS GOLF the right to use the CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT. The word advertising is used in both sections but the term ENDORSEMENT definition excludes likeness or image for promotional events, which is a key part of advertising.",

        "explanation": "The wording is contradictory in the first half of the sentence and the second half of the sentence. The first portion of the sentence implies that the consultant must ONLY use ADAMS GOLF MANDATORY PRODUCT, but then goes on to say he can use equipment from any manufacturer, which is a complete contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section states that ADAMS GOLF will reimburse CONSULTANT for reasonable travel expenses when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph, but ADAMS GOLF will not pay CONSULTANT session fees. This section is worded in a way that infers that ADAMS GOLF will be charged the expense, but not ADAMS GOLF fees. The section should have been worded so that this clause would read that ADAMS GOLF will not pay CONSULTANT.",

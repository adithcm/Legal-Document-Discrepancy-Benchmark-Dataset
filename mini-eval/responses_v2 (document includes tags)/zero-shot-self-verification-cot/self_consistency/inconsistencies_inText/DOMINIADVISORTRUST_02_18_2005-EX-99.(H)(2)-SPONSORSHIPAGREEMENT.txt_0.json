        "section": "The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Domini will cover legal counsel fees. However, it also states that the Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses. Since legal fees are operating expenses, the two terms contradict each other, since it is not clear who is responsible for paying this specific fee. This creates ambiguity as to which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.",

        "explanation": "The text states that this agreement may be terminated at any time, but then states that there has to be a 60 day written notice. This is a contradiction because if it can be terminated at any time, there should be no need for a 60 day written notice. This creates ambiguity as to which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.",

        "explanation": "This section allows Domini to subcontract obligations and states Domini is not responsible to the trust for acts and omissions of any subcontractor. This creates a legal loophole by removing essential information. It contradicts the general principle that a contracting party is responsible for the performance of its obligations, even if delegated to a subcontractor. By stating Domini is *not* responsible, it potentially circumvents legal responsibility for failures in oversight or performance of essential services by subcontractors, creating a situation where the Trust may have limited recourse for damages or non-performance.",

        "section": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Web site\" shall mean a collection of interconnected webpages residing on the internet. A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites. The term \"Hosted Site\" shall mean the online portal of the Customer that is hosted by i-on under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Web site\" is broad and general, which is acceptable. However, the definition of \"Hosted Site\" circularly defines it as 'the online portal of the Customer that is hosted by i-on under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.' This doesn't explain what an 'online portal' is or what distinguishes it from a regular website. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes about the scope of i-on's responsibilities, as it's unclear what specifically constitutes the 'Hosted Site.'",

The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The second sentence creates an ambiguity. While the first sentence refers to the customer, the second sentence uses the term \"subscriber\" without explicitly stating that the \"subscriber\" and \"customer\" are the same entity. While it is implied, it isn't clearly stated, which could lead to potential confusion or dispute. The legal ambiguity stems from the potential need to prove that the \"subscriber\" and \"customer\" are indeed the same entity in order to enforce the payment terms against the Customer.",

This lack of clarity makes it difficult to determine if i-on has fulfilled its obligations, potentially leading to disputes. The term 'reasonable steps' needs to be explicitly defined.",

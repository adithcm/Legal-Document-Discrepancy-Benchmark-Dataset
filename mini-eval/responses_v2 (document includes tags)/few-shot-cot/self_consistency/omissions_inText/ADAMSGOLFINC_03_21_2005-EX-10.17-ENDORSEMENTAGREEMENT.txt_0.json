        "explanation": "The definition of \"PRODUCT\" is broad, encompassing all golf clubs. This creates a potential conflict with section 4D which allows the CONSULTANT to endorse and play the [*****]. While 4D attempts to limit the potential conflict (no logo on Adams Golf products), the fundamental allowance of endorsing a competing product directly contradicts the exclusivity clause in Section 4A, which prevents endorsing products from other manufacturers. This makes the scope of acceptable endorsement activity unclear.",

CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the MANDATORY PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement.",
        "explanation": "This clause defines the course of action should consultant find that the mandatory product supplied is not suitable, and in that course of action, Adams Golf is given 30 days to supply a suitable product. However, a key clause is missing that addresses what happens if Adams Golf fails to supply a product, or decides not to terminate the agreement. The omission of how to resolve this scenario leads to legal uncertainty, meaning that the consultant has no recourse and is still required to play with the 'unsuitable' product, or face breach of contract for violation of the use of mandatory products.",

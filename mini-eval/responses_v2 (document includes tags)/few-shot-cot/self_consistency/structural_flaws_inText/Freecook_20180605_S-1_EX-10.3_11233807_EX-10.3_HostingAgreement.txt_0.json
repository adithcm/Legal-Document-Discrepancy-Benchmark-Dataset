Client acknowledges and agrees that all due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are guaranteed by the Company, regardless of whether the company receives required materials, documentation, or approvals in a timely fashion from the client. Delays will not affect the due dates.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an internal contradiction. It states that all due dates are guaranteed by the Company, *regardless* of whether the company receives necessary materials from the client. This is illogical and unenforceable. A company cannot realistically guarantee due dates if the client's input is required and delayed. This is an in-text contradiction because it presents two conflicting ideas: guaranteed deadlines and dependence on the client's timely actions.",

However, the added sentence says that the client can pay the remaining at any time or in multiple installments before the completion of the scope of work.

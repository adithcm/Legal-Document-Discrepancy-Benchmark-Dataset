        "explanation": "The agreement initially defines the client as Natalija Tunevic, 'director of FreeCook.' However, Natalija Tunevic is signing on behalf of 'Client' but as an individual, not as an agent of FreeCook, as denoted in the signature block. Therefore, if the client is supposed to be FreeCook, then there is a structural flaw as the agreement is structured between the named parties.",

        "explanation": "The contract states the 'Service Provider' will provide support relating to the 'Client Website'. The subsequent sentence reads: 'Company is not obligated to provide any Customer Service except as specified in this Section'. Because the terminology is not consistent ('Service Provider' vs. 'Company'), the parties have misaligned obligations as 'Company' is never defined. This creates an internal contradiction as one sentence implies an obligation for the service provider, while the following sentence claims the company has no obligation",

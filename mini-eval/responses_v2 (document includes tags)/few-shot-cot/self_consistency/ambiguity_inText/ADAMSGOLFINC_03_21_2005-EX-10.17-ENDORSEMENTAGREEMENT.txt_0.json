        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. This excludes use of likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'ENDORSEMENT' is limited to the use of the CONSULTANT's name for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF and explicitly excludes the use of likeness or image for promotional events unless agreed upon in writing. However, Section 3, 'CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT,' grants ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right to use the CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT. This creates an ambiguity because Section 3 appears to grant a broader right than the defined 'ENDORSEMENT' in Section 2A, potentially including uses of the likeness or image that are explicitly excluded in the definition unless specifically agreed to otherwise. Therefore, the discrepancy is that the definition restricts the meaning of 'ENDORSEMENT' while the clause granting the right appears to grant a wider right.",

        "explanation": "The clause states that the CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. Immediately following, the clause states that the CONSULTANT is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction, provided he makes a good faith effort to use ADAMS GOLF products whenever possible. These clauses contradict each other. The first clause imposes an exclusive use of ADAMS GOLF products, while the next clause says that the Consultant is not restricted in which product they use.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his discretion, participate in television and radio commercials, photo shoots, modeling, and promotional appearances. ADAMS GOLF shall reimburse CONSULTANT for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances. Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that the Consultant 'may, at his discretion, participate in' several events. The second and third sentences seem to impose an obligation on ADAMS GOLF to reimburse travel expenses when the consultant makes 'special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph'. Because the consultant 'may' participate, it is implied that ADAMS GOLF has no right to request or require the consultant to make any appearance. Thus, the paragraph is creating an obligation for ADAMS GOLF when no corresponding obligation exists for the Consultant. The fact that the Consultant may participate means he might not participate, which means that ADAMS GOLF might have to provide travel expenses to someone making an optional appearance.",

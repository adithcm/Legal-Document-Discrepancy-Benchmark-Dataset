        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This clause attempts to impose a standard of liability on the Sponsor that is significantly higher than what is typically applied under corporate law and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The language suggests that the Sponsor is liable even for simple errors of judgment or mistakes of law, absent bad faith, willful misfeasance, or gross negligence. This contradicts the general principle that individuals or entities providing services are only liable for negligence or a breach of their fiduciary duty. Making the Sponsor liable for 'any error of judgment' is overly broad and potentially unenforceable, as it conflicts with the industry standard of care and could discourage competent entities from serving as sponsors.",

        "explanation": "This clause sets the terms of termination by either party. The discrepancy with the law comes in the fact that the terms can be terminated at 'any time'. If either party terminates at any time, it could lead to a breach of contract in certain jurisdictions because there is no reasonable cause needed to terminate.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This section contains several problematic aspects. First, it allows Domini to subcontract obligations without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust regarding the subcontractor's qualifications. This undermines the Trustees' oversight responsibilities and their duty to ensure that services are provided competently. Second, it attempts to limit Domini's liability for the acts and omissions of subcontractors to cases of gross negligence only. Under agency law, the principal (Domini) is generally responsible for the actions of its agents (subcontractors) acting within the scope of their authority. This clause attempts to contractually limit that liability, which may not be permissible depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the services being subcontracted. A court may find this limitation of liability to be unenforceable, particularly if it harms the Trust or its shareholders.",

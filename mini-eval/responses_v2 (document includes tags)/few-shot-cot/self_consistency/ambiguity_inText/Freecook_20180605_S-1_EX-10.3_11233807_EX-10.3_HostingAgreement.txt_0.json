        "explanation": "The clause uses the term \"reasonable sum\" but doesn't define it. However, Section 2 specifies the Contract Price as $5,000. There's an inconsistency because the initial statement suggests the price might be subject to interpretation of 'reasonable', when a fixed amount is actually in use. Therefore, there is ambiguity in the usage of terms.",

The surcharge for rush work may be different from the standard hourly rate.",
        "explanation": "The edit contains both ambiguity and potential contradiction. The change from 'Client will pay' to 'Client may be asked to pay' introduces ambiguity about whether the surcharge is mandatory or discretionary. Secondly, stating that 'the surcharge for rush work may be different from the standard hourly rate' implies there IS a standard hourly rate set somewhere in the contract. It is not and this presents inconsistency.",

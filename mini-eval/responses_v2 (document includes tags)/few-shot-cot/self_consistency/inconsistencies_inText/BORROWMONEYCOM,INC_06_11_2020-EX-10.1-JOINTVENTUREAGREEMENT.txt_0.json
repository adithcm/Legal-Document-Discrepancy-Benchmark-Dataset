An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members. A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction in determining the Venture's value. First, it uses total revenue generated over the last 3 months to calculate the value. However, later the interest of the withdrawing member is based on the 'proportion of their respective capital account'. It does not address how 'total revenue generated over the last 3 months' is associated with a member's capital account. This creates an inconsistency in the methodology.",

        "section": "The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph delineates the expenses to be paid by the Trust. However, it also states that Domini will cover legal counsel fees, which contradicts the initial statement that the Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, as legal counsel fees are indeed an operating expense.",

        "explanation": "The text suggests that termination can occur 'at any time' but also requires 60 days' written notice. The 'at any time' aspect conflicts with the notice period, creating uncertainty whether a party can immediately terminate with the payment of a penalty or if the 60 days notice period still applies.",

        "explanation": "The phrase states Domini may subcontract its obligations, but follows up by stating it is not responsible for its subcontractors. This is a misaligned terminology as Domini is stating that there is no form of recourse available for the Trust if the subcontractor does not perform in accordance to the contract. This would mean Domini is free to hire any subcontractor, regardless of their ability to perform or their trustworthiness, and the Trust would bear the risk without any recourse against Domini. This contradicts the expected standard of care in subcontracting, where the primary contractor typically remains responsible for the performance of its subcontractors.",

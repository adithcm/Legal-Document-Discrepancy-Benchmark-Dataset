        "explanation": "The phrase 'i-on will schedule and perform such maintenance during any time of the day, including weekdays' contradicts the continuous operation promise. While maintenance is necessary, performing it 'during any time of the day, including weekdays' introduces uncertainty about service availability and is inconsistent with the 'continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week' commitment. There is ambiguity regarding whether the maintenance window will be 'reasonable'.",

The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence says the fee is a 'recurring monthly fee'. The second sentence has a typo. It says 'The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 20th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999'. Since it says 'fees' with an 's', this implies that the recurring monthly fee is to be paid up front. However, the third sentence refers to 'failure to pay such fees in a timely manner'. This implies that the payments are not one lump payment, but rather recurring.",

Or does it still default to the 6 month term, as indicated in the first sentence?",

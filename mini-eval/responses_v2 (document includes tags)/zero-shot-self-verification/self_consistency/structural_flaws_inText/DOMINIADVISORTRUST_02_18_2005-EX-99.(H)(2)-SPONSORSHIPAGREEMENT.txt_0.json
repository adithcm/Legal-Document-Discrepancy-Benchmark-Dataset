        "section": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence establishes a clear fee structure: 0.50% of average daily net assets, accrued daily, and payable monthly. The second sentence introduces uncertainty by stating that if Domini serves for less than a full period, the compensation is 'subject to renegotiation.' This creates ambiguity. It's unclear what happens if renegotiation fails or what the default compensation would be. This ambiguity could lead to disputes.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The text initially states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty.' However, the very next sentence contradicts this by stating that if the Sponsor terminates within the first year, a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee applies. This is a direct contradiction.",

Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "The contract language regarding Domini's responsibility for subcontractors introduces ambiguity. Limiting responsibility 'to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage' raises questions.  What happens if the subcontractor has inadequate or no insurance?  Does Domini bear any further responsibility, or is the Trust left to absorb the loss? Also, stating Domini is 'not responsible for acts or omissions...outside the scope of the contracted services' is problematic. Domini has a duty to ensure proper oversight of its subcontractors. It is a structural flaw of legal terms that would allow Domini to not be held liable for the actions of the subcontractor.",

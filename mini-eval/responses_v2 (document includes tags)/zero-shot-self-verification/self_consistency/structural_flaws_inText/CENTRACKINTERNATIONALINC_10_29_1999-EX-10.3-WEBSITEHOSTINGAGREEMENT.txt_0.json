        "explanation": "The phrase 'at their discretion and convenience' contradicts the implication that fees must be paid 'in a timely manner.' This creates ambiguity about the payment terms and allows for interpretation that significantly delays the payment.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon fifteen (15) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The text implies that the agreement can be terminated at anytime without cause, but at the same time, it mentions that the agreement is automatically renewed for one month if the customer does not provide notice to cancel.

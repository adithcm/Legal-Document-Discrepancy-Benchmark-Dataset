Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph does not provide a clear process for acceptance of change orders by the Company. It states that changes must be submitted and accepted, but it does not specify the criteria or time frame for the Company's acceptance. This ambiguity can lead to disputes about whether a change order has been properly accepted and whether the Company is obligated to perform the additional work.",

There is an inconsistency in the written content here, because it is not clear whether the company can type or proofread in other circumstances.

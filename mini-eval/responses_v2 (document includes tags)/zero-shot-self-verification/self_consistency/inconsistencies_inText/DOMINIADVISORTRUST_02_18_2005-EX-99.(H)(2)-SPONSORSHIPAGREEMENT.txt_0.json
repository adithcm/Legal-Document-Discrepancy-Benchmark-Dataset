        "section": "The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The text indicates that Domini will cover the legal counsel fees. This contradicts the later statement that 'the Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses'.",

        "explanation": "The contract states that it can be terminated 'at any time' but then adds the condition that it can only be terminated 'on not less than 60 days' written notice'. 'At any time' suggests immediate termination, which conflicts with the 60-day notice period.",

        "explanation": "This section presents a legal contradiction. While subcontracting is permissible, stating that Domini is not responsible for the acts or omissions of the subcontractor could be problematic under agency law. Generally, a principal (Domini) is liable for the actions of its agent (the subcontractor) acting within the scope of their authority. This clause attempts to disclaim that liability, which may not be enforceable, especially if the subcontractor's actions constitute negligence or a breach of the agreement's underlying obligations.",

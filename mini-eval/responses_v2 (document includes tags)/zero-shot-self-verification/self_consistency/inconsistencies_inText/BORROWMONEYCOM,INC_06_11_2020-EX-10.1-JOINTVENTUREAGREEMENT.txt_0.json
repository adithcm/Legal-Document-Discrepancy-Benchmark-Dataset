        "explanation": "The description of BorrowMoney.com, Inc.'s duties uses vague language. 'HTML code' and 'technical aspect requirements' are not defined, and 'as needed' lacks specificity, making the obligation unclear. This ambiguity creates uncertainty about the scope of their responsibilities. Also, there is no mention on the time frame to have the HTML code, build, deploy and maintain all technical aspect requirements. This makes it difficult to prove if BorrowMoney.com has actually held up their end of the deal.",

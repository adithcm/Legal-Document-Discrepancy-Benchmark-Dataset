        "section": "8. MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows: The agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year: 1. Year 1. $[*****] 2. Year 2 $[*****] 3. Year 3 $[*****] 4. Year 4 $[*****] 5. Year 5 $[*****] B.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within three months following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than March 31, 2006. C.In the event that CONSULTANT is prevented from competing for reasons outside his control, the parties agree to a good faith attempt to resolve the issues. If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "Paragraph 8 outlines the consultant's obligation to participate in a minimum number of events. If the minimum is not met, the consultant must repay Adams Golf a specific amount per event missed. Subparagraph C states that if the consultant is prevented from competing due to reasons outside of his control, the parties should attempt to resolve the issue in good faith. However, if a resolution cannot be reached, Adams Golf has the sole discretion to demand prorated repayment. This creates a contradiction because, while the consultant is unable to compete due to reasons outside of their control, Adams Golf still maintains the discretion to demand repayment. This contradicts the intent of resolving the issue in good faith, as it gives Adams Golf the upper hand to demand repayment even when the consultant is not at fault.",

        "explanation": "The term \"satisfactory record of play\" is not defined within the contract. This lack of clarity creates ambiguity in determining whether the consultant has met the minimum requirements for tournament participation. Without a clear definition, disputes could arise regarding what constitutes a satisfactory record of play, as the interpretation is left to subjective judgment.",

        "explanation": "The base compensation is paid \"upon completion of each calendar year of the contract.\" However, Section 1 states that the agreement commences on September 1, 2004.

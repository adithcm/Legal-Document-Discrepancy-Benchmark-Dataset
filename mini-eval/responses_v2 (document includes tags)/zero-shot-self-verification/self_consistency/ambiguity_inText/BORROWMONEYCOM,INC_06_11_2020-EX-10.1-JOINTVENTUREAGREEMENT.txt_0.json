        "explanation": "The Term states that the duration of the venture will continue until February 28, 2025, and then goes on to say, unless terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the Managers, which is misaligned because only Members can agree to make changes to the contract and not Managers. Therefore there is a misaligment.",

This contradicts the initial statement that managers must jointly decide, because a majority vote implies that not all managers need to agree, contradicting the requirement for a joint decision.",

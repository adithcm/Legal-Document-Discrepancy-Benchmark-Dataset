        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. This excludes use of likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is ambiguous. It grants ADAMS GOLF the right to use CONSULTANT'S name for marketing materials but excludes the use of CONSULTANT'S likeness or image for promotional events without written agreement. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about what constitutes \"marketing materials\" versus \"promotional events,\" potentially restricting ADAMS GOLF's ability to fully leverage the endorsement.",

        "explanation": "This clause creates an in-text contradiction. It states that the CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, but then it says that the CONSULTANT is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction, provided he makes a good faith effort to use ADAMS GOLF products whenever possible. It contradicts the exclusivity requirement by allowing the CONSULTANT to use equipment from any manufacturer as long as a good faith effort is made to use ADAMS GOLF products.",

Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a contradiction. It says that ADAMS GOLF will reimburse the CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances.

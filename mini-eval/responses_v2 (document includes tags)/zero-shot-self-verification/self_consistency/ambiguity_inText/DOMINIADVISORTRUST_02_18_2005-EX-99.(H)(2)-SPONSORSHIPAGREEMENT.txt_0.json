        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to impose a very high standard of liability on the Sponsor, making them liable even for simple errors of judgment or mistakes of law, even if there is no evidence of negligence, bad faith, or recklessness. This contradicts the general legal principle that parties are only liable for negligence, gross negligence, or intentional misconduct. This attempts to eliminate the requirement of proving fault, which is unusual and potentially unenforceable.",

        "explanation": "This section allows either party to terminate the agreement with 60 days written notice. However, the Sponsor can terminate the agreement while still receiving a penalty payment equal to one year of management fees. This incentivizes the sponsor to terminate the agreement because they can still collect fees without the work.",

        "explanation": "This section allows Domini to subcontract its obligations without requiring the Trustees' approval of the subcontractor's qualifications. This relinquishes the Trust's oversight of who is performing critical functions. Also, Domini is only responsible for the subcontractor's gross negligence, thus creating no responsiblity for the negligience of the subcontracted party.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"reasonable sum\" is ambiguous. A legally sound contract should specify a definitive price. The term \u201creasonable\u201d is vague and subjective, as what one party deems reasonable may differ significantly from the other's perception.",

        "explanation": "The statement that due dates are not subject to delay is contradictory and unrealistic. Unforeseen circumstances such as illness, technical difficulties, or necessary changes to the project scope could reasonably cause delays.  Stating that no delays are possible is unenforceable and creates an inconsistency.",

        "explanation": "The text mentions that the surcharge for rush work may be different from the standard hourly rate, but the contract does not mention what the standard hourly rate is, and it does not define how the surcharge for rush work is calculated.

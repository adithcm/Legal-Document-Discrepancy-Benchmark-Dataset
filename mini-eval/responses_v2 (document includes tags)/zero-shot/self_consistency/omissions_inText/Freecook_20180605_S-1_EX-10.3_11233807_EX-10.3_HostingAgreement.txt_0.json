(a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions' is ambiguous. The sentence structure is unclear, making it difficult to determine whether the 'more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions' clause applies to all preceding items (pages, graphics, etc.) or only to 'text, graphic or page design or programming.' This ambiguity creates potential disputes about what constitutes 'Additional Work' and when a Change Order is necessary.",

        "explanation": "This section first states that the company will not correct any errors, but it later mentions that the Client may elect to pay the company to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above. This statement creates an ambiguity as to the actual responsibility of correcting errors and creates conflicting obligations. One states they do not need to proof read and the other states that the client can elect to pay the company to proof read, creating conflicting obligations.",

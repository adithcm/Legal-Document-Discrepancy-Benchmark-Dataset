        "explanation": "The term of the joint venture is defined with specific start and end dates. However, it also includes a clause that allows for early termination by mutual agreement of the 'Managers'. This introduces a potential contradiction because the agreement is between the 'Members,' not the 'Managers.' The power to terminate should reside with the Members. If the Managers can terminate, it undermines the Members' control and creates ambiguity.",

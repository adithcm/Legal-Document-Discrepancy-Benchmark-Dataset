The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees at their discretion and convenience. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The statement \"The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees at their discretion and convenience\" contradicts the implicit understanding that payments should be made in a timely manner. While the customer is responsible for paying, allowing them to pay at their \"discretion and convenience\" undermines the requirement for timely payments and the consequence of service interruption for late payments.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon fifteen (15) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The two sentences contradict each other. The first sentence states that the agreement will automatically renew for one-month periods unless either party gives a 15-day notice of non-renewal. The second sentence states that either party can terminate the agreement at any time with a 15-day written notice. The contradiction lies in the fact that the first sentence implies renewal unless notice is given, while the second allows termination at any point, effectively negating the renewal clause.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence states that i-on will be liable under any circumstances, then the second sentence attempts to limit this liability. This is contradictory because you can not be liable under any circumstance, but only be charged for a one month fee. This needs to be reworded.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation\" is ambiguous. It does not specify the process or criteria for renegotiation, which could lead to disputes over the revised compensation amount. It also creates uncertainty about how the fee is calculated for partial years before renegotiation occurs.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The text provides contradictory statements, the first stating that the agreement may be terminated at any time without penalty, and the second stating that there will be a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee if the Sponsor terminates the agreement within the first year. This creates ambiguity as to whether or not there is a penalty for termination.",

Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "The clause limiting Domini's responsibility for a subcontractor's acts and omissions to the extent of the subcontractor's liability insurance coverage creates ambiguity. It's unclear if Domini has a duty to ensure the subcontractor maintains adequate insurance, what happens if the insurance is insufficient to cover damages, or if Domini bears any residual liability. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes regarding financial responsibility for subcontractor negligence or misconduct.",

        "section": "The duration of this Venture (the \"Term\") will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025, unless terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the Managers.",
        "explanation": "The term of the agreement is explicitly stated to end on February 28, 2025. However, the agreement also allows for early termination by mutual agreement of the 'Managers'. This creates a discrepancy, because the 'Managers' are appointed by the 'Members'. Early termination requires mutual agreement of the managers, which may not be in alignment with all of the members. This can be problematic if the managers are not in agreement with the members.",

        "explanation": "This section stipulates that the Managers must jointly decide on major issues, but then it contradicts itself by stating that a majority vote of the Managers will suffice when they cannot reach an agreement. Jointly implies that all managers must be in agreement, not just a majority. This leads to an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence states that amendments to capital contributions can be made by the decision of the Managers. The second sentence contradicts this by stating that when the members' interests are affected, unanimous consent of the Managers is needed. This is contradictory, because the first sentence does not state anything about the members' interests, and the second sentence does not state anything about who makes the decision.",

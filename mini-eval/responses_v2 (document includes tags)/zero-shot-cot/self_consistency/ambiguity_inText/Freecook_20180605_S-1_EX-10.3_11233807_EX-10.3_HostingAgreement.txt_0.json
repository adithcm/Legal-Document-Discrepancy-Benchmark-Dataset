        "explanation": "The contract states that the client will pay a reasonable sum for the website design, but does not specify the exact price. This is an ambiguity because 'reasonable sum' is subjective. Without a fixed price, there is potential for dispute. The contract should clearly state the contract price in this section. ",

        "explanation": "This section first guarantees delivery within the specified timeframe (Feb 8 - May 3), but then states that due dates in the Scope of Work are not subject to delay. This is a contradiction. If the company *guarantees* a timeframe, there is an implied allowance for potential delays, especially considering unforeseen circumstances. The absolute statement that due dates are 'not subject to any delay' is unrealistic and contradictory to the guarantee of a timeframe. It sets an impossible standard and shifts all risk of delay onto the Company, regardless of the cause.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines that the client may have to pay a surcharge for work outside of normal hours if a rush deadline is requested or if they fail to provide content on time. However, the language 'Client may be asked to pay' is ambiguous. This is not definitive language and does not clearly state under what conditions the client *will* be charged and how this will be determined. It leaves room for interpretation and dispute. The final sentence, 'The surcharge for rush work may be different from the standard hourly rate,' is also vague. The hourly rate isn't clearly outlined.",

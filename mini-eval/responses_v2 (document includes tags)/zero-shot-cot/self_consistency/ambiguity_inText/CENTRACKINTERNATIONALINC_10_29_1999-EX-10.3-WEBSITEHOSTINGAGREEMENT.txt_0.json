        "explanation": "The contract states that i-on will maintain the site continuously, but then contradicts itself by stating that maintenance will be performed at i-on's convenience without prior notice. This creates ambiguity because the customer is not aware of when the website will be down for maintenance and how long it will be down for. There is no indication that the customer will receive notice for the maintenance, nor is there a maintenance schedule.",

        "explanation": "This is a contradiction because it says they will provide connectivity to the internet, but then says they will not be responsible for maintaining such connectivity with the phone company and the Internet backbone access provider. If they are not responsible for maintaining connectivity, then they are not responsible for providing connectivity. This means that they are not providing any services.",

        "explanation": "While stating the customer is responsible for paying within 30 days, it does not specify when the invoice will be received by the customer. If the customer receives the invoice at the end of the month, it would be an extremely short period of time. If the invoice is sent at the end of the following month, it would be a long period of time. This is considered ambiguous because it does not give a clear indication of when the invoice will be sent to the customer.",

The inclusion of '*specified Description of duty*' further obfuscates the meaning and creates ambiguity about what duties are being referenced. It is also vague what 'leased/rent' means and who will be paying the lease or rent. The lease can be an asset if owned, or a liability if paying for it and its terms are not clear.",

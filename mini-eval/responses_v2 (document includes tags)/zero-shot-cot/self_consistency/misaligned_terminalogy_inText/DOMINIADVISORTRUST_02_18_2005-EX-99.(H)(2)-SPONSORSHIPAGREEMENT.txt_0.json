        "explanation": "This section states that Domini will provide 'certain oversight, administrative, and management services'. However, Section 1(l) includes answering questions about the securities holdings of the Trust, investment limits, social investment philosophy and proxy voting/shareholder activism. Answering these questions could arguably fall under investment advice, which is explicitly excluded in the last sentence of section 1. This creates a potential contradiction, as Domini is both tasked with activities that could be interpreted as investment advice and explicitly barred from providing it.",

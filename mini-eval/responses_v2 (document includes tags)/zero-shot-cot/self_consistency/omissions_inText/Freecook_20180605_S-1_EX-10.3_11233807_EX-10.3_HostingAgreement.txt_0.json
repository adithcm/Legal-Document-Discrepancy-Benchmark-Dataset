(a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph introduces ambiguity in defining 'Additional Work' by using subjective terms like 'substantial revisions' and 'significant changes'. This lacks a clear, objective threshold for determining what constitutes Additional Work, potentially leading to disputes over billing and project scope. The phrase 'more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions' is relatively clear, but the other criteria are vague.",

        "explanation": "The sentence 'Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a Change Order' implies that *all* changes requiring additional work must be submitted and accepted. However, it doesn't explicitly state what happens if the company *doesn't* accept the Change Order. Does the Client still have to pay for the initial agreed-upon Scope of Work?  The ambiguity creates a potential loophole.",

        "explanation": "The text states the Client may elect to pay company to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above. Earlier, the document mentions acceptable electronic documents are Microsoft Word electronic document or plaint text electronic document, this means if the client submitted a PDF, the company will not type and proofread the text. The contradictory part is that the company *will* type and proofread, if the company gets paid to do so. There is a discrepancy here between company not proofreading and company proofreading content.",

        "explanation": "The term 'hourly rate' is used without defining what the standard hourly rate is. This is an omission that makes it difficult to calculate the rush work surcharge. The omission of the defined hourly rate introduces ambiguity and potential for disputes over cost calculations.

        "explanation": "The structure of this is flawed. In particular, the phrase, 'Client shall pay an additional surcharge for any services requiring work to be performed outside of normal business hours by reason of a rush deadline requested by Client or as a result of Client's failure to meet scheduled times for delivery and/or review and approval of information, content and materials' is not written in a way that makes sense.

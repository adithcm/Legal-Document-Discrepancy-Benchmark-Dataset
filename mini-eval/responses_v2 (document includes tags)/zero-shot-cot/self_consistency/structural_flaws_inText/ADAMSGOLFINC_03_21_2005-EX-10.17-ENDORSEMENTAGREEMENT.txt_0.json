        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "This definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is overly restrictive and unusual. It essentially limits Adams Golf to only using Tom Watson's name, devoid of any other association. This is impractical for marketing purposes as a name alone carries little weight without associated recognition factors like likeness or image. This creates ambiguity because while Adams Golf is paying for an 'endorsement', the definition severely limits the practical use and value of that endorsement.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his sole discretion, use any golf clubs he desires, including those from competitors. He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This clause contradicts the implied intent of an endorsement agreement, which is for the consultant to exclusively use and promote the company's products. While the clause states he is 'encouraged' to use mandatory products, it explicitly allows him to use competitors' clubs and even endorse them. This undermines the exclusivity clause (Section 4) and the overall purpose of the agreement. The phrase \"whenever feasible\" is vague and provides no concrete obligation for the consultant to actually use Adams Golf products. This creates an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "18. BASE COMPENSATION For the entire term of this Agreement, from September 1, 2004 through [*****] ADAMS GOLF may pay CONSULTANT a base compensation of up to [*****] dollars. The actual base compensation shall be determined annually based on Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion. No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.",
        "explanation": "This section regarding base compensation is contradictory. It states Adams Golf 'may' pay up to a certain amount, but the actual amount is determined at their sole discretion based on financial performance and 'no compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.' This creates a contradiction. The term \"base compensation\" usually implies a guaranteed minimum payment. The clause essentially gives Adams Golf the option to pay nothing if they choose, rendering the idea of base compensation meaningless. This creates ambiguity about the financial obligations of Adams Golf.",

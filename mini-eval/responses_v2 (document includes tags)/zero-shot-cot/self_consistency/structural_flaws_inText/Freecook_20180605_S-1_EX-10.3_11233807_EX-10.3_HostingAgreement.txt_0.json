Client acknowledges and agrees that all due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are guaranteed by the Company, regardless of whether the company receives required materials, documentation, or approvals in a timely fashion from the client. Delays will not affect the due dates.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an in-text contradiction. First, it states the project timeframe. Second, it states that all due dates are guaranteed by the Company, which is contradictory, as it's unreasonable to guarantee delivery dates if the client doesn't provide the required materials, documentation, or approvals. Lastly, it repeats that delays will not affect due dates which is impossible and makes this section of the contract unenforceable.",

        "explanation": "This section introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the payment terms. The first sentence states that the remaining $3,100 is due on completion of the Scope of Work. However, the subsequent sentence contradicts this by allowing the Client to pay the remaining amount at any time or in installments before the Scope of Work is completed. This creates confusion about the agreed-upon payment schedule and allows for multiple interpretations, making it an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section creates an in-text contradiction regarding the provision of Customer Service. The first sentence states that Company is obligated to continue providing Customer Service throughout the agreement and cannot alter or cease providing it. The second sentence directly contradicts this by stating that Company, at its sole discretion, can alter or cease providing Customer Service without any liability. This contradiction makes it unclear whether the Company is actually obligated to provide Customer Service, leading to potential disputes.",

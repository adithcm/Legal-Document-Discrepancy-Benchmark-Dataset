If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions.",

                "explanation": "Clause 15.1 states a 12-month notice period, while clause 15.2 provides the Company with the right to terminate the agreement with immediate effect but says within 30 days, the changed text changes it to 90 days. This creates an in-text contradiction because it's unclear within which timeframe the company has to pay. This causes uncertainty in enforcement because it is not clear how much time is allowed for the payment to be made.",

                "explanation": "Clause 11.2 originally stated that no accrued holiday can be carried forward but now some holidays may be carried forward, creating an in-text contradiction because it's unclear what happens if the executive has over 5 days of accrued holiday. This inconsistency introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as it is now unclear which rule applies regarding carry-over holidays.",

In addition, in the original text the salary is reviewed every two years, and in the changed text is every 5 years. This creates ambiguity in the contract and it is not clear when these events are supposed to happen.",

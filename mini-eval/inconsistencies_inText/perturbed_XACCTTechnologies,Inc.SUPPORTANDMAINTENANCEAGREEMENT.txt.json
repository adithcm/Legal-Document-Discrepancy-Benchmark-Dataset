                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Fees shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice which shall be exclusive of any applicable local, state, federal, use, excise, value added, GST or other taxes imposed on the fees payable for the Product Maintenance and Support Services which shall be the responsibility of Licensee.",
                "changed_text": "Fees shall be payable within sixty (60) days of invoice which shall be exclusive of any applicable local, state, federal, use, excise, value added, GST or other taxes imposed on the fees payable for the Product Maintenance and Support Services which shall be the responsibility of Licensee.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment terms. Section 2 now states payment is due within 60 days. This contrasts with a potential clause in Attachment 1 (not provided but implied) that might still state a 30-day payment window for certain support levels, leading to ambiguity and potential disputes. The actual deadline to pay is unclear.",

                "changed_text": "The Agreement will be automatically renewed for additional one (1) year terms (subject to applicable fee adjustments) unless ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary of the Effective Date Licensee gives written notice to XACCT of its intention not to renew.",
                "explanation": "Here, the deadline to notify about not renewing is extended to 90 days, while another section might still suggest a 30-day notice period. This discrepancy introduces an in-text contradiction. Imagine that in Attachment 1 there is a clause that states that support will be automatically renewed unless written notice is provided at least thirty (30) days prior to the anniversary of the Effective Date.",

XACCT may also terminate Support Services if Licensee breaches any provision of this Agreement or the License Agreement and such breach is not remedied within thirty (30) days after Licensee receives written notice of the breach.",

XACCT may also terminate Support Services immediately if Licensee breaches any provision of this Agreement or the License Agreement and such breach is not remedied within fifteen (15) days after Licensee receives written notice of the breach.",
                "explanation": "This changes the grace period for rectifying a breach from thirty (30) to fifteen (15) days, introducing inconsistency. This timeframe contradiction about how much time licensee has to resolve the breach causes confusion and therefore uncertainty in enforcement, which violates the Definition.",

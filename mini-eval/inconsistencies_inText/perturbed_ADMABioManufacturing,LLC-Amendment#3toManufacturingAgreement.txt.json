                "original_text": "Such payments shall be made in accordance with Section 3.4 of the Agreement; provided, however, that the initial payment described in Section 5(a) above shall be due no later than December 31,2017.",
                "changed_text": "Such payments shall be made in accordance with Section 3.4 of the Agreement; provided, however, that the initial payment described in Section 5(a) above shall be due no later than January 15, 2018.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the due date of the initial payment. The original text specifies December 31, 2017, while the modified text specifies January 15, 2018. This creates uncertainty about when the payment is actually due, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties shall complete such amendment to the Quality Agreement within 30 days after the Amendment Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by altering the timeframe for amending the Quality Agreement. The original text specifies a 'best efforts' clause within 60 days, while the modification mandates completion within 30 days. This creates uncertainty about the parties' obligations and introduces a potential breach if 'best efforts' are made but the amendment isn't completed in 30 days.",

                "original_text": "Should ADMA fail to supply a minimum of [***] Batches of Product (the \"Minimum Volume\") of Product during the time period as specified in this Amendment #3, ADMA agrees that Sanofi Pasteur shall be entitled to obtain from ADMA as liquidated damages, and not a penalty, amounting to $[***] ([***]) USD.",
                "changed_text": "Should ADMA fail to supply a minimum of [***] Batches of Product (the \"Minimum Volume\") of Product during the time period as specified in this Amendment #3, ADMA agrees that Sanofi Pasteur shall be entitled to obtain from ADMA as liquidated damages, amounting to $[***] ([***]) USD. However, these damages shall be considered a penalty, and not liquidated damages.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding the nature of the damages for failing to meet the minimum volume. The original text explicitly states that the damages are liquidated and not a penalty. The modification then states the opposite â€“ that they are a penalty and not liquidated. This introduces legal uncertainty regarding the enforceability of this clause.",

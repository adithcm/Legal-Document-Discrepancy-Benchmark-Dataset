                "changed_text": "7.1 The SENDER undertakes the obligation to pay irrevocably and unconditionally the Service for the Contracted Capacity, twenty (20) calendar days at the latest, after ECOPETROL files in the offices of the SENDER the invoice for the provision of the Service.\n\n7.1a Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 7.1, for invoices exceeding USD 1,000,000, the SENDER shall have thirty (30) calendar days to remit payment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by providing two different payment deadlines. Clause 7.1 states a 20-day deadline, while newly added clause 7.1a introduces a 30-day payment deadline for invoices exceeding USD 1,000,000. This creates uncertainty about which deadline applies to invoices exceeding that amount.",

                "explanation": "Here, clause 7.9 stipulates a 15-day deadline for settling the shipment tax, while newly added clause 7.9a grants the SENDER 30 days for the same. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding payment deadlines.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline for the Retainer Fee installments. Originally, the payments are due on the first of the specified months, but now they are due on the fifteenth. This creates uncertainty about the actual due date, potentially leading to disputes.",

All other Tournament Bonuses due to Consolidated Artists shall be paid by TPC within forty-five (45) days following TPC's receipt of an invoice from Consolidated Artists or Advantage.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction by swapping the payment deadlines for Major Tournament wins and network televised US PGA Tour Tournament wins. Initially, Major Tournament wins had a 60-day payment window, while network televised US PGA Tour Tournament wins had a 45-day window. Now, Major Tournament wins have 30 days and network televised US PGA Tour Tournament wins get 60. This conflict creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadlines for each type of tournament bonus.",

The original text specifies 30 days post-quarter end, whereas the modification extends this to 45 days. This directly contradicts the existing clause and creates uncertainty regarding when the statement is actually due.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms for Milestone #1. The original clause states payment is due within 30 days, but the added text specifies a 60-day payment window if Conformis fails to deliver per the R&D work plan. This creates ambiguity as to the exact payment deadline and conditions under which the extended deadline applies, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The addition of the sentence 'However, Conformis shall be allowed to develop such instruments for academic research purposes, notwithstanding the other clauses of this section' introduces a contradiction to the exclusivity clause. While the primary part of the clause strictly prohibits developing instrumentation for third parties until 2032, the added sentence creates an exception for academic research. This creates uncertainty regarding the scope of the exclusivity agreement and could lead to disputes about what constitutes 'academic research' and whether specific activities fall under this exception.",

                "explanation": "The clause originally stipulates that amendments must be in writing. The added text introduces an exception allowing modifications to operational procedures in Exhibit 1 through verbal agreement with subsequent written confirmation. This creates a contradiction as it becomes unclear whether the written agreement must also be 'signed' (like with an instrument), or if a simpler 'written confirmation' suffices. This creates ambiguity regarding the formal requirements for amending Exhibit 1 and opens potential disagreements.",

                "original_text": "5. Term and Termination.\n\n          a. Term. This Agreement  shall become  effective on the Effective Date      and shall  continue in effect until  either  Party  informs the other Party      with thirty (30) day prior written notice of termination of this Agreement.",

This Agreement  shall become  effective on the Effective Date      and shall  continue in effect until  either  Party  informs the other Party      with thirty (30) day prior written notice of termination of this Agreement.\n\n          b. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5a, either party may terminate this agreement with no prior written notice should a party feel as though their expectations are not being met.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the termination clause. Section 5a states that termination requires a 30-day written notice, while Section 5b states that either party can terminate without prior notice if expectations are not met. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about the proper procedure for termination.",

Notwithstanding Section 3(g), The Business Affiliate may keep copies of Confidential Information indefinitely following termination of the agreement, however it may not use this information for monetary gain.",
                "explanation": "This creates a conflict. Section 3(g) mandates the return or destruction of confidential information within 15 days of termination. The added section states that the Business Affiliate can keep copies indefinitely, contradicting the prior clause. This creates ambiguity about what happens to confidential information after termination.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict regarding the indemnification clause. The original Section 6 states that the indemnification provisions survive the termination of the agreement for whatever reason. The modified section limits the survival to a period of one year. This contradicts the original intent of indefinite survival, and create uncertainty about the duration of the indemnification obligation.",

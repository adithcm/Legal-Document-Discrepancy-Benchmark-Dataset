                "original_text": "Turpin shall deliver to the Company all Work\nProduct and Company Property, including all originals and copies thereof,\nin Turpin's possession and/or control, at the request of the Company, or, in the absence of such a request, upon the termination of Turpin's\nemployment with the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Turpin shall deliver to the Company all Work\nProduct and Company Property, including all originals and copies thereof,\nin Turpin's possession and/or control, only at the explicit request of the Company, regardless of Turpin's employment status with the Company.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the return of Company Property. The original clause requires return upon request or termination of employment. The modified clause stipulates that the return is only required upon the explicit request of the Company, removing the automatic return upon termination of employment, thus creating ambiguity about when and how the company assets should be returned and managed.",

Termination under this Section 12 shall be effective from the date\nwritten notice is delivered or the date specified in the written notice.\nwhichever is later.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may, with written notice, be terminated by\neither party should Turpin's employment with the Company terminate for any\nreason. However, termination by Turpin requires a 90-day written notice, while termination by the Company is effective immediately upon delivery of written notice.\nwhichever is later.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a conflict in the termination clause. The original clause states that either party can terminate with written notice, and the termination is effective from the date written notice is delivered or the date specified in the written notice, whichever is later. The modified clause introduces different conditions based on who is initiating the termination. Turpin needs to deliver 90-day written notice to terminate the agreement, whereas the company can terminate effective immediately upon delivery of written notice. This introduces uncertainty in the enforcement of this clause, if there is no mutual agreement on the termination date.",

                "changed_text": "Time shall be of the essence for each and every term and condition\nhereof, except for the delivery of the Work Product as outlined in Section 6, where a reasonable delay will be permitted contingent upon circumstances that the employee can demonstrate are outside of his control.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a conflict with the principle that time is of the essence. While the original clause emphasizes strict adherence to deadlines, the revised text introduces an exception for the delivery of Work Product, where delays are permitted under certain circumstances. This creates ambiguity about when and how strictly time-related obligations will be enforced, which can lead to disputes.",

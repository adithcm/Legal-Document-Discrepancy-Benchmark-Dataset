Notwithstanding the above, Torvec may, in its sole  discretion, cancel its participation in any of the above-referenced events by notifying Vendor of such cancellation not later than two weeks  prior to the due date(s) for payment hereunder. All checks shall be made payabe to: Phoenix Performance, LLC and mailed to 481, Schuylkill  Rd, Phoenixville, Pa. 19460.",

Notwithstanding the above, Torvec may, in its sole discretion, cancel its participation in any of the above-referenced events by notifying Vendor of such cancellation not later than two weeks prior to the due date(s) for payment hereunder. However, Torvec must provide the Vendor with a written notice of cancellation at least 30 days before the payment due date, or Torvec will be liable for a cancellation fee of 20% of the total payment due. All checks shall be made payable to: Phoenix Performance, LLC and mailed to 481, Schuylkill Rd, Phoenixville, Pa. 19460.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows Torvec to cancel participation with two weeks' notice before the payment due date. The modified text introduces a contradictory clause stating that if cancellation occurs less than 30 days before the payment due date, a cancellation fee will be applied. This creates uncertainty about the cancellation policy and potential financial penalties.",

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the event that Torvec files a petition commencing a voluntary case under the Bankruptcy Code, Vendor shall have thirty (30) days to terminate the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a uniform condition for termination in case of bankruptcy filings, providing 60 days to dismiss the case. The modification introduces a conflicting condition specifically for Torvec's bankruptcy filing, giving Vendor only 30 days to terminate the agreement. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the termination timeline based on which party files for bankruptcy.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the term concludes on October 31, 2010, unless renewed by agreement. The modified text adds a clause stipulating that the agreement automatically renews for another year unless a non-renewal notice is provided before September 30, 2010. This introduces a contradiction because the original text implies that renewal requires explicit agreement, while the modified text suggests automatic renewal unless action is taken. It's contradictory because an agreement is needed vs it's automatically renewed.",

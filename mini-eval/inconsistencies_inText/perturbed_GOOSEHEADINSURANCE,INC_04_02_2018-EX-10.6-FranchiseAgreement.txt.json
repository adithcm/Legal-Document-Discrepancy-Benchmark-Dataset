                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that Net Revenues will be remitted monthly and also potentially quarterly. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty, which section should be enforced and disrupts the consistency of the payment terms.",

If we do not (or an applicable marketing fund does not) receive any payment due under this Agreement on or before the due date, then that amount will be deemed overdue. If any payment is overdue, then you agree to pay us, in addition to the overdue amount, interest on the overdue amount from the date it was due until paid, at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum (but not more than the maximum rate permitted by law, if any such maximum rate applies). Our entitlement to such interest will be in addition to any other remedies we may have. Any report that we do not receive on or before the due date will also be deemed overdue.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'However, at our sole discretion we may choose not to charge interest on late payments', the clause becomes contradictory. The first half states that interest will be charged on overdue payments, and the second half makes it optional. This conflict creates uncertainty and potential for disputes.",

This inconsistency makes it unclear which interval is applicable, making it uncertain when adjustments will occur.",

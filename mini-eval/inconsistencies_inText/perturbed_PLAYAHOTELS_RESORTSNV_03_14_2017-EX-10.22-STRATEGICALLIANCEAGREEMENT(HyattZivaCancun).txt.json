                "original_text": "If the Receiving Party declines its right of first offer with respect to any Development Opportunity, or fails to notify the Offering Party of its decision within the ten (10) business-day period described above, or if Hyatt's affiliate or Playa's affiliate (as applicable) fails to acquire the Development Property within the sixty (60)-day period described above, then the right of first offer with respect to that Development Opportunity shall expire, and the Offering Party thereafter may acquire, develop and/or operate (and/or grant any other person or entity the right to acquire, develop and/or operate) an all-inclusive resort or other business on the Development Property without any restriction under this Agreement, subject to any restrictions under any Existing Franchise Agreement or other agreement between Hyatt (or its affiliate) and Playa (or its affiliate).",
                "changed_text": "If the Receiving Party declines its right of first offer with respect to any Development Opportunity, or fails to notify the Offering Party of its decision within the ten (10) business-day period described above, or if Hyatt's affiliate or Playa's affiliate (as applicable) fails to acquire the Development Property within the sixty (60)-day period described above, then the right of first offer with respect to that Development Opportunity shall expire after a written 30-day notice, and the Offering Party thereafter may acquire, develop and/or operate (and/or grant any other person or entity the right to acquire, develop and/or operate) an all-inclusive resort or other business on the Development Property without any restriction under this Agreement, subject to any restrictions under any Existing Franchise Agreement or other agreement between Hyatt (or its affiliate) and Playa (or its affiliate).",
                "explanation": "The original text states the right of first offer expires immediately after the 60-day period if the conditions aren't met. The modified text introduces a conflicting condition: the right of first offer expires only after a written 30-day notice is given following the original 60-day period, causing ambiguity about when the right truly expires. This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that in any conflict between the ICC Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act, the ICC Rules will prevail. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that the Federal Arbitration Act will prevail instead. This in-text contradiction creates significant uncertainty regarding the governing procedures for dispute resolution, leading to potential legal challenges and difficulties in enforcing arbitration decisions.",

                "original_text": "The prevailing Party in any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing Party in connection with such arbitration (including any actions to enforce any award(s) or any of the provisions of this Section 5). If a Party prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, such Party shall be entitled to recover an equitable amount of such fees, costs and expenses as determined by the arbitrator(s). All amounts recovered by the prevailing Party under this Subsection shall be separate from, and in addition to, any other amount included in any award(s) rendered in favor of such Party pursuant to this Section 5.",

If a Party prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, such Party shall be entitled to recover an equitable amount of such fees, costs and expenses as determined by the arbitrator(s). All amounts recovered by the prevailing Party under this Subsection shall be separate from, and in addition to, any other amount included in any award(s) rendered in favor of such Party pursuant to this Section 5.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows the prevailing party to recover 'all reasonable fees, costs and expenses'. The modified text limits this recovery to '50% of fees, costs and expenses.' This contradiction creates uncertainty because the prevailing party's ability to recover costs is now ambiguously defined, potentially leading to disputes over what portion of costs are actually recoverable.",

You shall pay to AIRSOPURE an initial franchise fee of $25,000.00 upon execution of this Agreement. You agree that the initial franchise fee represents payment for the initial grant of the Franchise rights and license granted herein, shall be fully earned upon execution of this Agreement, and the said fee will not be refunded under any circumstances unless otherwise specifically set forth herein. You must find a suitable Center site within 90 days of signing the Franchise Agreement, unless we mutually agree otherwise. If we cannot agree on a Center location, within 4 months, we may a) extend your search time, b) exchange your territory, or c) terminate your Franchise and refund up to 70% of your Franchise Fee, at our sole discretion. There are no refunds under any other circumstances.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states the franchise fee is non-refundable \"unless otherwise specifically set forth herein,\" and then describes circumstances where a refund of up to 70% is possible. This change removes the option for any form of franchise fee refund if a center is not found, creating a contradiction in terms.",

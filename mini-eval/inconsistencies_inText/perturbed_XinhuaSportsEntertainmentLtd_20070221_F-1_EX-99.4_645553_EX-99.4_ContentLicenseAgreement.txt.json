                "changed_text": "1.1  In this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires the following words      shall have the following meaning:\n\n                 \"AFFILIATES\"       means any company, corporation, partnership, joint venture or                    other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is                    controlled by or is under common control with XFN.\n\n2.9 For the avoidance of doubt, an 'Affiliate' may also include entities with whom XFN has a significant business relationship, as determined solely by XFN.",
                "explanation": "This introduces an in-text contradiction by defining 'Affiliates' narrowly in Section 1.1 (control) but then broadly in Section 2.9 (significant business relationship), creating uncertainty about which definition applies in different contexts.  This could lead to disputes over which entities qualify as affiliates and are entitled to the rights and obligations associated with that status.",

TERM\n\n7.1  This Agreement shall take effect from the Effective Date and continue in      full force and effect for twenty (20) years thereafter, unless otherwise      terminated in accordance with Clause 8.\n\n8.4  Notwithstanding section 7.1, XFN has the sole discretion to extend the term of the agreement for successive one-year periods, without requiring CEIS's consent, for up to a total of ten additional years.",
                "explanation": "Section 7.1 states the agreement lasts 20 years unless terminated per Clause 8. Section 8.4 now allows XFN to unilaterally extend the term for up to 10 additional years. This contradicts the defined 'Term' in Section 7.1, as the term can now potentially last longer without CEIS's agreement. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by changing the conditions of contract termination. It introduces a contradicting statement, Section 8.5, stating CEIS only needs to give 10 days written notice while Section 8.1 states XFN should give a 30 days written notice. This creates uncertainty about the notice period needed to terminate the agreement.",

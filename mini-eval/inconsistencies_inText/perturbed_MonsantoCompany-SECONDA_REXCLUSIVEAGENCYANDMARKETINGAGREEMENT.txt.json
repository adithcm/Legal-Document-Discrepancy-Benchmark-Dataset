                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" of a person or entity shall mean: (i) any other person or entity directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such person or entity. For purposes of this Agreement, an 'Affiliate' may also include any person or entity with whom the subject person or entity has a strategic alliance or partnership, regardless of ownership structure.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Affiliate' introduces an in-text contradiction. The original definition relies on control through ownership, whereas the modified definition expands it to include strategic alliances or partnerships, regardless of ownership. This conflicts with other sections that might rely on the original, stricter definition of 'Affiliate' for determining rights and obligations, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

If so, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall by check or wire transfer, to the Agent's designated account for the payment of the applicable Commission pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 3.6(a) subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6(c).",
                "changed_text": "Within thirty (30) days following the end of each month, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall determine whether a Commission becomes payable, i.e., whether the cumulative Program EBIT for the Program Year up to the preceding month equals an amount in excess of the First Commission Threshold. However, no commission payments will be made until the end of the Program Year, at which point all cumulative commissions will be calculated and disbursed. If so, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall by check or wire transfer, to the Agent's designated account for the payment of the applicable Commission pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 3.6(a) subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6(c).",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding when commission payments are made. The original text implies monthly payments, while the added sentence stipulates that no payments occur until the end of the Program Year. This introduces uncertainty about payment timing.",

The payments shall not be subject to any \"set-off\".",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces an in-text contradiction by allowing Monsanto to defer the Agent's monthly contribution payments, while the original text mandates monthly installments. This creates ambiguity regarding the payment schedule and whether Monsanto's discretion overrides the Agent's obligation to make monthly payments.",

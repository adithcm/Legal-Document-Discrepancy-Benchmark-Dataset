                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the payment terms. The original text states royalties are paid on the first day of the specified months, but the modification also states they are paid on the fifteenth day of the same months. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty about when payment is actually due.",

Such termination shall relieve Naked of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement provided that Wade shall retain all warrants he has received hereunder that have vested as of the date of such termination. In the event of such termination as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by Wade (i) Wade's contractual liabilities and obligations until the date of termination still exist notwithstanding such termination, (ii)  Naked shall be under no obligation to sell any Wade Products but shall nevertheless owe the Royalty on any Wade Products sold; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Wade shall forfeit all warrants he has received hereunder.

                "explanation": "The original clause states that Wade forfeits all warrants upon termination due to a material breach. The modified clause states that Wade retains all warrants even in the event of termination due to material breach. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the disposition of the warrants upon termination, causing uncertainty about whether Wade loses or keeps them, and creating a financial incentive for Wade to argue for retaining the warrants.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a clause allowing Prolong to extend payment deadlines by 30 days, while the original clause specifies exact payment dates. This creates ambiguity as to whether the original deadlines are strictly enforced or if Prolong has the option to delay payments without penalty.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction by stating Sabco shall provide insurance, but then granting Prolong the option to waive the insurance requirement entirely. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding whether Sabco is actually obligated to maintain the insurance policy, as Prolong's waiver power effectively nullifies the initial requirement. It contradicts the initial obligation.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation adds a requirement for Sabco to provide notice and receive approval from Prolong for driver substitutions, directly contradicting the earlier statement that Sabco can substitute drivers 'without prior notice to Prolong or prior approval from Prolong.'

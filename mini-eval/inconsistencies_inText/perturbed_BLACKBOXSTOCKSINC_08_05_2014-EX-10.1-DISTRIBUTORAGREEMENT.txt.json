                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction because Section 1.03 initially states that payment terms are 'net cash upon delivery,' meaning immediate payment is required. However, the modification changes this to 'net 30 days from the date of invoice,' providing a 30-day payment window. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as it's unclear whether payment is due immediately or within 30 days.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires written consent from both parties to extend the agreement, while the modified text states the agreement automatically extends unless either party provides a written notice of non-renewal. This is a contradiction because one clause requires mutual agreement for extension, while the other implies automatic extension unless actively prevented. This creates uncertainty about the process and requirements for extending the agreement.",

If either Theravance or GSK shall fail to make a timely payment pursuant to this Article 6, any such payment that is not paid on or before the date such payment is due under this Agreement shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the average one-month London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for the United States Dollar as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, effective for the first date on which payment was delinquent and calculated on the number of days such payment is overdue or, if such rate is not regularly published, as published in such source as the Joint Steering Committee agrees.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there will be a 30-day grace period before any interest is applied to late payments. Furthermore, interest shall only accrue if the late payment exceeds $1,000,000 USD.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a grace period and a threshold for interest accrual, which conflicts with the initial statement that interest accrues on any late payment. This creates uncertainty about when interest actually applies.",

The Breaching Party shall, if such breach can be cured, have sixty (60) days after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default (or, if such default cannot be cured within such 60-day period, the Breaching Party must commence and diligently continue actions to cure such default during such 60-day period). Any such termination shall become effective at the end of such 60-day period unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such 60-day period (or, if such default is capable of being cured but cannot be cured within such 60-day period, the Breaching Party has commenced and diligently continued actions to cure such default provided always that, in such instance, such cure must have occurred within one hundred twenty (120) days after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default).",

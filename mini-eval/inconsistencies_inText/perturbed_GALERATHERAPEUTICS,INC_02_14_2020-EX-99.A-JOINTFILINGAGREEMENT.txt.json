                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; and each of them is fully responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning all other persons making the filing, regardless of actual knowledge of inaccuracy.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction. The original text states that parties are *not* responsible for the accuracy of others' filings unless they know of inaccuracies. The modified text states that parties *are* fully responsible, even without knowledge. This introduces uncertainty about the scope of responsibility and potential liability.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to any executive officer of Galera Therapeutics, Inc., but revocation will be in effect for all parties and not just the revoking party.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause regarding the termination of the agreement. The original states that revocation only affects the revoking party. The modified text states that revocation affects *all* parties. This creates ambiguity about the mechanism for exiting the agreement and its impact on the other parties. The change in recipient of revocation notice also introduces ambiguity.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts; however, only the original signed document held by Galera Therapeutics, Inc. will be considered the legally binding instrument. Electronic copies are for informational purposes only.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for counterpart execution, meaning each signed copy is equally valid. The modified text states that only the original held by Galera is binding, invalidating the use of counterparts and creating issues regarding enforceability for other parties who may only possess signed counterparts. This makes the legal basis of the agreement uncertain for most participants.",

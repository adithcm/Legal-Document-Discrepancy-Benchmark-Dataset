Life Technologies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the Tests in the Territory, in accordance with Section 3.2, using sales channels and methods, and adhering to substantially similar standards that it generally employs with respect to its laboratory developed tests.",
                "changed_text": "3.3 Life Technologies Responsibilities. Life Technologies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the Tests in the Territory, in accordance with Section 3.2, using sales channels and methods, and adhering to substantially similar standards that it generally employs with respect to its laboratory developed tests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Life Technologies has no obligation to promote the Tests in the Territory and may cease promotion at any time without penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction. The first sentence obligates Life Technologies to use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the tests. The added sentence states that Life Technologies has no obligation to promote the tests, creating uncertainty about Life Technologies's responsibilities and leading to disputes over Life Technologies's obligations.",

The Demand Forecast and Quarterly Forecasts shall be a good faith but non-binding forecast. In the event the parties develop a Collaboration Assay under the terms of this Agreement, demand for such Collaboration Assay shall be included in the Demand Forecast at all times following the Launch of such Collaboration Assay.

A Performance Standard, mutually agreed to in accordance with Section 3.5(i), shall take effect immediately upon the launch of any Test.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the timing of when the performance standards take effect. Initially, it's stated that the performance standard comes into effect in the second full calendar quarter after the launch of the test, but the changed text specifies that the same takes immediate effect. This conflict will create confusion and disagreements about how the performance is assessed.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires Life Technologies to pay Biocept within 60 days of the invoice date, while the modified text stipulates a payment period of 30 days. This contradiction in payment terms causes an in-text contradiction by presenting two different payment deadlines. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and potential disputes over the payment schedule.",

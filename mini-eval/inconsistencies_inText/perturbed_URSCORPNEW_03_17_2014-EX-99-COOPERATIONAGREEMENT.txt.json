In the event of the replacement as set forth in Section 3(c) of any JANA Nominee appointed to the CEO Succession Committee pursuant to this Section 5, his or her successor shall be promptly appointed to the committee seat vacated by such former director to serve until the 2015 Annual Meeting. The CEO Succession Committee and any other committee currently or in the future designated to review or oversee the selection process for the New CEO shall not take any material action prior to the March Board Meeting.\n\n(b) In order to ensure an orderly transition, Mr. Koffel may in his sole discretion continue (including, for the avoidance of doubt, after the 2014 Annual Meeting) as the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company during the selection process for the New CEO until the Board shall appoint the New CEO, which shall not be later than the earlier of December 31, 2014, or Mr. Koffel's voluntary resignation from such positions; provided that Mr. Koffel will resign as a director of the Company and the Chairman of the Board upon the effectiveness of the Board's appointment of the New CEO; provided, further, that nothing contained herein is intended to modify any employment agreement, equity award, retirement plan or other pre-existing obligation of the Company to Martin Koffel or to impose any additional obligations on Martin Koffel (beyond the obligation to resign as provided in this Section 4(b)). The Board shall appoint the New CEO as a director of the Company with a term expiring at the Company's next annual meeting after his or her appointment.",

                "explanation": "The modified text creates in-text contradictions. First, Section 4(a) initially states that the CEO Succession Committee shall *not* take material action before the March Board Meeting, but this has been changed to say the CEO Succession Committee *may* take material actions before the March Board Meeting. The second contradiction relates to the deadline for the appointment of the New CEO. Section 4(b) initially stated the deadline was December 31, 2014, but this has been changed to June 30, 2014.",

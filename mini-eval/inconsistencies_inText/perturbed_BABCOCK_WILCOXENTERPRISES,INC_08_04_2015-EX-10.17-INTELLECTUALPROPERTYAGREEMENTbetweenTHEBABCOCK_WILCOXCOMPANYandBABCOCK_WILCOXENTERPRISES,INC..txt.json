In the event that one Party is responsible vis-a-vis a Third Party for the payment of costs and expenses related to the Shared Location, such Party will provide to the other Party a statement of all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Shared Location as set forth in Schedule 6.3 of the Master Separation Agreement. The other Party will reimburse the responsible Party for the applicable percentage of such costs and expenses within thirty (30) days of receipt of such statement, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties.",

                "explanation": "This removes 'other than the RemainCo Core Field'. The effect is to remove the restriction of the covenant so that RemainCo may not sue SpinCo, even in the RemainCo Core Field after the Distribution Date. However, elsewhere there is a clause that SpinCo may use such licensed materials in fields OTHER than RemainCo core field, leading to a contradiction.",

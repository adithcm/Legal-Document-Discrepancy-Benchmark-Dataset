                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Section 3.2 now states payments are due within 60 days, while later (in the third perturbation) the termination payment timeline relies on payments being made within 30 days. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "Changing the termination notice period from 90 days to 60 days creates a direct contradiction. The original clause requires 90 days' notice, while the modified clause requires only 60, thus causing in-text contradiction and uncertainty.",

The original clause requires 30 days from the end of the month for normal payments, but the changed termination payment requires 60 days after the termination date for the first payment. This in-text contradiction generates confusion.",

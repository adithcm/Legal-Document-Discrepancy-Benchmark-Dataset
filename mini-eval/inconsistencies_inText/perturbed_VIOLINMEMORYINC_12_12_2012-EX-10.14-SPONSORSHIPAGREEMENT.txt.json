In exchange for the Sponsorship Rights to be provided to Sponsor during each Contract Year of this Agreement, Sponsor shall pay an annual fee (the \"Sponsorship Fee\") during each Contract Year of the Term. The Sponsorship Fee shall be four­million U.S. Dollars (USD $4,000,000.00) during each Contract Year.\n\n(b) Deposit. Sponsor shall make a non-refundable deposit upon execution of this Agreement of five-hundred-thousand U.S. dollars (USD $500,000.00) (the \"Deposit\"), which shall be applied against the Sponsorship Fee for the first Contract Year.\n\n(c) Payment Schedule. The Sponsorship Fee shall be payable in two (2) equal semiannual installments per year on or before March 1 and September 1 of each Contract Year of the Term; with the first installment due on March 1, 2014, unless Forty Niners SC notifies Sponsor that the Stadium will not open in 2014.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating in Section 5(b) that the deposit is non-refundable, but then adding a clause that makes it refundable under certain conditions (termination within the first year). This creates an in-text contradiction that could lead to disputes.",

Any payment required to be made by Sponsor hereunder that is not paid within fourteen (14) days from the date such payment becomes due and owing shall bear interest at an annual rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum or, if lower, the maximum allowed by law from the due date to the date payment is actually made. The right of Forty Niners SC to receive interest under this Section 5(f) shall be in addition to all other rights it may have as a result of Sponsor's failure to make payments when due.",

However, if the late payment is due to a documented error on the part of Forty Niners SC in the invoicing process, no interest shall be charged for a one-time grace period not to exceed 30 days. The right of Forty Niners SC to receive interest under this Section 5(f) shall be in addition to all other rights it may have as a result of Sponsor's failure to make payments when due.",
                "explanation": "The perturbation adds an exception to the interest on late payments clause. While the original clause states that any payment not made within 14 days will incur interest, the modified version provides a scenario where interest is waived due to an invoicing error on the part of Forty Niners SC. This introduces a conditional waiver that wasn't present before, creating a conflict and potential dispute about when interest applies.",

                "explanation": "The change reduces the initial cure period from 30 days to 15 days, creating a direct contradiction. The original allowed 30 days to start correction, whereas the edited version only allows 15 days. This inconsistency could lead to disputes about the valid termination date of the agreement.",

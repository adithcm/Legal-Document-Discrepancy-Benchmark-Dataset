                "original_text": "Commissions on premiums shall be paid to the Agency within 30 business days of the month in which such premiums are received and recorded by MICOA, subject to deduction by MICOA of any return commissions due from the Agency.",
                "changed_text": "Commissions on premiums shall be paid to the Agency within 60 business days of the month in which such premiums are received and recorded by MICOA, subject to deduction by MICOA of any return commissions due from the Agency.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the payment deadline for commissions. The original text states '30 business days', while the modified version changes it to '60 business days', creating uncertainty about the actual payment deadline. If the Agency and MICOA disagree on which deadline should be adhered to, this could be lead to contractual disputes.",

                "original_text": "The purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date.  In return for this payment, for a two-year period following the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be completed within 30 calendar days after the termination date. In return for this payment, for a one-year period following the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying both the purchase completion timeframe (from 60 to 30 days) and the non-compete period (from two years to one year). This creates uncertainty regarding the agency's obligations after termination and the timeline for payment. This contradiction could lead to disputes over the enforcement of the non-compete clause and the timely completion of the purchase.",

                "changed_text": "Agency may assign this Agreement with the written permission of MICOA or its successors or assigns, provided that MICOA’s consent is not unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction to the assignment clause. By adding 'provided that MICOA’s consent is not unreasonably withheld,' it implies that MICOA has a duty to provide reasonable justification for denying an assignment request, contrasting with the original text, which grants MICOA complete discretion to deny assignment without any justification. This could lead to disputes over what constitutes 'unreasonably withheld' consent and whether MICOA breached the contract by denying an assignment request.",

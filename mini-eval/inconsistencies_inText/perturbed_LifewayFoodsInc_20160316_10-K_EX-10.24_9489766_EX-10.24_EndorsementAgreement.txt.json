Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month.

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that royalty payments are due within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month. The modified text changes this deadline to sixty (60) days. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the payment deadline, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes about when Lifeway is obligated to remit royalty payments.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that address changes require 'written notice'. The modified text changes this to 'verbal notice'. This is a direct contradiction. Furthermore, approvals were to be via email, but are now via standard mail.",

Each Sponsor represents and warrants to each other Party that such Sponsor is bound by and has complied with,  and agrees that such Sponsor shall continue to be bound by and comply with, the Equity Commitment Letter and that each other Sponsor (other  than any Defaulting Sponsor) shall be entitled to enforce, or direct the enforcement of, such Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this  Agreement if and only if the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) have determined by unanimous written consent that the conditions of  the Offer have been satisfied or to waive all such conditions remaining unsatisfied. No Party shall attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment  Letter until the conditions set forth in this Section have been satisfied. Purchaser shall have no right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter  unless and until directed to do so by the unanimous written consent of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor).",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the requirements for enforcing the Equity Commitment Letter. The original text requires unanimous written consent from all non-defaulting sponsors for enforcement. The modified text allows any sponsor to enforce the letter if the conditions of the Offer have been satisfied and allows Purchaser to enforce when directed by any of the Sponsors. This creates uncertainty about which condition must be met before enforcing an equity commitment letter, as both unanimous consent and direction by any Sponsor are stipulated.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Section hereof (other than Sections 1 through 6 (inclusive) hereof) shall  survive indefinitely following the termination of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the termination clause. The original text states that termination before certain dates requires the unanimous written consent of Participating Sponsors. The modified text states that termination requires consent of a simple majority of the Participating Sponsors. This creates uncertainty regarding what proportion of sponsors must agree to terminate the agreement, potentially leading to disputes over its validity.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the amendment process. The original text requires that amendments or modifications to the agreement are agreed upon in writing and signed by each of the Sponsors. The modified version allows for amendments or modifications if Sponsors holding at least 66% of the total Commitments agree in writing. This discrepancy creates ambiguity as to whether all Sponsors must agree to amendments, or whether a supermajority is sufficient.",

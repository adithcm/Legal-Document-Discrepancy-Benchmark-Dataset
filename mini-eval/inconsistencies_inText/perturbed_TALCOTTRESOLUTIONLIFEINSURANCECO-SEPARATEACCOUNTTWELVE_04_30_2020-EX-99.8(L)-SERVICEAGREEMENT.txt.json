Payment shall be in federal funds transmitted by wire from the Fund's designated Settling Bank to the NSCC.",

The original text specifies payment on the same Business Day via wire transfer from the Fund's Settling Bank to the NSCC. The modified text allows for payment within 3 Business Days via ACH transfer to the Fund's account. This creates uncertainty about which payment terms apply.",

Payment shall be made via check mailed to the Separate Account address as designated by the Administrator.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment timeline and method for redemptions. The original text specifies same-day payment via federal funds transfer through the NSCC. The modified text allows for payment within 5 Business Days via mailed check. This contradiction creates ambiguity and potential disputes over the agreed-upon redemption process.",

The modified text shortens the notice period to 30 days and extends the cure period to 30 days but includes ANY breach for termination. This creates conflicting terms regarding the termination process, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

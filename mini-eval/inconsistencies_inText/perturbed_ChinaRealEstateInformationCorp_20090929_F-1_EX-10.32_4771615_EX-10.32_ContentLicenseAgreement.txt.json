                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the termination clause. Originally, a party had seven days to vacate bankruptcy proceedings to avoid termination. This change extends the period to ninety days, creating ambiguity. It is unclear whether seven or ninety days is the applicable timeframe, thus creating potential disputes regarding termination rights.",

Effect of Termination.\n\n(a) Upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee shall be entitled to use the Licensed Domain Names and  Licensed Content for a limited period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, during which it shall diligently work to transition to another solution.  Upon expiration of this Agreement or such 90-day period, (i) all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed  Domain Names and Licensed Content shall immediately cease, and (ii) Licensee shall immediately discontinue all use of the Licensed Domain  Names and Licensed Content.",

Effect of Termination.\n\n(a) Upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee shall be entitled to use the Licensed Domain Names and  Licensed Content for a limited period of time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, during which it shall diligently work to transition to another solution.  Upon expiration of this Agreement or such 90-day period, (i) all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed  Domain Names and Licensed Content shall immediately cease, and (ii) Licensee shall immediately discontinue all use of the Licensed Domain  Names and Licensed Content.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by stating the Licensee can use the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content for a 'limited period of time, not to exceed thirty (30) days', and then states 'Upon expiration of this Agreement or such 90-day period'. It is unclear whether the licensee has 30 or 90 days to transition to another solution. This creates legal uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction concerning the length of excused non-performance due to force majeure. Initially, Licensee's non-performance was excused for up to ninety days, but it is now limited to thirty days. Since it states \"Neither Party shall be liable\", then limits ONLY the Licensee, it creates ambiguity on whether the Licensor is also limited to thirty days. This inconsistency can lead to disputes about the valid duration of excused non-performance.",

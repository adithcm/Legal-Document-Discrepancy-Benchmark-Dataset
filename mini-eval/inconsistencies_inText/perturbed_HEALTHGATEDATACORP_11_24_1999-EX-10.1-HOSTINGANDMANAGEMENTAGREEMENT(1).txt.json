                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the invoice payment deadline from 60 days to 30 days. This creates ambiguity about the actual payment terms, leading to potential disputes.",

For the purposes of             this Agreement, \"Use\" shall mean a retrieval or download by a             Publishers' subscriber of the full-text of an article. There shall             not be any additional use fees or charges for users' browsing of             table of contents or abstracts.

For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Use\" shall mean a retrieval or download by a Publishers' subscriber of the full-text of an article, or viewing of abstract. There shall be additional use fees or charges for users' browsing of table of contents. Use Fees shall be billed by HealthGate quarterly and all payments are due by electronic transfer within 15 days after the date of the invoice.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates a contradiction by defining “Use” to include abstracts, changing the billing cycle from monthly to quarterly, specifying payments due by electronic transfer (instead of cheque), and specifying 15 days as the payment date (instead of the end of the following month). This creates significant financial and operational uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the interest rate on late payments, the base rate determination bank, and the fact that no interest will be charged after 90 days of payment.

                "original_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.",
                "changed_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the appointment of the agent will automatically renew for subsequent 30 day periods unless either party provides written notice of termination with 10 days' notice prior to the end of the current term.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that the appointment terminates after 45 days, or completion of the offering, BUT THEN states that it automatically renews every 30 days unless notice is given. This creates ambiguity on the termination date and creates potential disagreements.",

In recognition of the long lead times involved in the conversion process, the Bank agreed to make an advance payment to the Agent in the amount of $25,000, all of which has been previously paid, which shall be credited against any fees or reimbursement of expenses payable hereunder.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, 50% of all fees payable to the agent will be deferred for a period of 180 days following the closing date. In recognition of the long lead times involved in the conversion process, the Bank agreed to make an advance payment to the Agent in the amount of $25,000, all of which has been previously paid, which shall be credited against any fees or reimbursement of expenses payable hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This introduces an in-text contradiction. The first sentence states that all fees are payable at closing or termination. The new added sentence states that 50% of the fees are deferred, creating a payment inconsistency. This generates uncertainty about when the agent should expect payment.",

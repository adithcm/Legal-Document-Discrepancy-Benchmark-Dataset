                "original_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period of one (1) year from the Effective Date unless sooner terminated pursuant to the termination provisions herein. Thereafter, this Agreement automatically renews for successive terms of one (1) year.",
                "changed_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period of one (1) year from the Effective Date unless sooner terminated pursuant to the termination provisions herein. Thereafter, this Agreement automatically renews for successive terms of one (1) year, unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. However, McDATA reserves the right to terminate the agreement at any time with no notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting terms regarding the renewal and termination of the agreement. The original text states that the agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms. The modified text adds a condition that either party can prevent renewal with 30 days' notice. However, it further adds that McDATA can terminate with no notice, contradicting the automatic renewal and the 30-day notice provision. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual duration of the agreement and the conditions for termination.",

SCOPE\n\n1.1 Sales to the US Government are not authorized under this Agreement.\n1.2 Reseller is authorized to sell to the US Government under special circumstances as directed by McDATA in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that sales to the US Government are not authorized. The added section contradicts this by stating that sales to the US government are authorized under special written circumstances from McDATA, introducing ambiguity as to whether the reseller can sell to the US government or not.",

If McDATA does not receive notice of a new distributor election and the Agreement is renewed, Reseller agrees that it will continue to purchase Products through the currently designated distributor.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller may elect a new distributor annually by notifying McDATA thirty (30) days prior to renewal of the Agreement. However, McDATA retains the sole right to select the distributor for the Reseller, and the Reseller's preferred choice will be considered but not guaranteed. If McDATA does not receive notice of a new distributor election and the Agreement is renewed, Reseller agrees that it will continue to purchase Products through the currently designated distributor.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction in the distributor selection process. The original text states the Reseller may 'elect' a new distributor. The changed text contradicts this by asserting that McDATA retains the 'sole right' to select the distributor. This will lead to uncertainty regarding which party ultimately decides the distributor and thus could lead to disputes.",

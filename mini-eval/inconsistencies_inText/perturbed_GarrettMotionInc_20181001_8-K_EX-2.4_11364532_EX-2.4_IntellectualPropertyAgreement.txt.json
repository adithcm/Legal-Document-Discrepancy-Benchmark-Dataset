                "explanation": "The added text creates an in-text contradiction. Initially, the section aims to grant SpinCo the freedom to utilize Honeywell Shared IP. However, the added text introduces a condition of 'rigorous auditing and approval process' before granting Honeywell Shared IP licenses. This contradicts the initial intent of ensuring SpinCo's freedom to use the IP and creates uncertainty about the conditions for license grants.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the conditions under which Honeywell Content can be used and shared. The original text allows the Honeywell Content usage only for internal purposes and sharing is strictly prohibited without Honeywell's prior written consent. However, the changed text says Honeywell Content may be used for any purpose and shared after informing Honeywell.

It is understood that Grantee has or will enter into franchise agreements with the City of Roanoke (\"Roanoke\") and the City of Salem (\"Salem\") and the Town of Vinton (\"Vinton\") (Grantor, Roanoke and Salem being hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the \"localities\" and singularly as a \"locality\") with fee provisions identical to this one, and that the total annual Franchise Fee to be paid to the three localities in aggregate is $98,196 for calendar year 2016 (\"base year total annual Franchise Fee\"). Grantor's Franchise Fee shall be a percentage share of the base year total annual Franchise Fee, which shall be determined on a pro rata basis according to its percentage share of the total dollar value of Grantee's gas sales occurring within the localities during the calendar year. For each calendar year of the Franchise, each locality's percentage share shall be determined by the following formula: total dollar value of Grantee's gas sales within Locality's percentage share = the Territorial Limits of the locality total dollar value of Grantee's gas sales in the three localities For calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before March 31, 2017.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the payment deadline for the Franchise Fee for the year 2016. Section 3(a) initially states that the fee should be paid on or before March 31, 2017, but the modification changes this deadline to June 30, 2017. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the actual due date and could lead to disputes over late payment penalties or compliance with the agreement.",

The original text specifies a minimum of forty (40) hours per week, while the modified text reduces this requirement to twenty (20) hours per week. This discrepancy creates uncertainty about the grantee's obligation regarding the availability of the business office and can cause dispute.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by altering the acceptable methods of delivering official notices. Initially, certified mail with return receipt was required. The modified clause accepts emails for official notices, changing the standards by which notices are considered delivered. The fact email is allowed but physical mail with return receipt is not anymore creates an ambiguity.",

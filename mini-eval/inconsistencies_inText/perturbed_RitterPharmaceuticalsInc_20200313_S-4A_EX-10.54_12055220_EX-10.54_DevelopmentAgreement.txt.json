                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction with Section 4.10, which states that interest accrues on payments more than 30 days past due. By extending the payment term to 60 days in Section 4.7, it becomes unclear when late fees apply, leading to potential disputes.",

Cumulative with and not exclusive of any and all other available remedies, payments that are more than 30 days past due hereunder, and which are not otherwise subject to a good faith dispute, shall accrue interest, from the due date until paid, at an annual rate equal to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern U.S. Edition, on the date such payment is due, plus an additional 200 basis points (2%).",

Cumulative with and not exclusive of any and all other available remedies, payments that are more than 90 days past due hereunder, and which are not otherwise subject to a good faith dispute, shall accrue interest, from the due date until paid, at an annual rate equal to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern U.S. Edition, on the date such payment is due, plus an additional 200 basis points (2%).",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradictory deadline for late payment interest accrual. Section 4.7 states payment is due in 60 days, but Section 4.10 now indicates interest applies after 90 days. This inconsistency introduces ambiguity concerning the enforcement of interest charges on late payments.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces two conflicting deadlines related to legal notices. Originally, registered mail notices are deemed delivered after 5 business days, and address changes require a 10-day notice. The modified text extends the mail delivery time to 10 days but shortens the address change notice to 5 days. This inconsistency creates uncertainty regarding which timeframe to follow, potentially invalidating legal notices and impacting dispute resolution.",

                "original_text": "For each new Authorized Location, upon written notice by Garman of the completion of the installation of the Software as contracted for in Section 4 including training provided for in Section 5, Sparkling shall operate and test the Software for an acceptance period of 30 business days in accordance with Sparkling's normal operating practices. At the end of each day during the acceptance period, Sparkling shall notify Garman of any instances in which the Software does not perform in accordance with the Specifications.",
                "changed_text": "For each new Authorized Location, upon written notice by Garman of the completion of the installation of the Software as contracted for in Section 4 including training provided for in Section 5, Sparkling shall operate and test the Software for an acceptance period of 30 business days in accordance with Sparkling's normal operating practices. At the end of each day during the acceptance period, Sparkling is not required to notify Garman of any instances in which the Software does not perform in accordance with the Specifications.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding Sparkling's obligation to notify Garman of software performance issues during the acceptance period. The original text mandates notification, while the modified text removes this requirement, creating uncertainty about the acceptance testing process and enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a direct conflict with the original clause stating the agreement is perpetual as long as fees are paid. The modified text introduces a fixed term with renewal conditions, contradicting the perpetual nature and creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration and termination rights.",

                "original_text": "Sparkling may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) calendar days written notice to Garman. If Sparkling terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 17(b), Sparkling shall cease using the Software at the end of the ninety (90) day notice period, and shall certify to Garman within thirty (30) calendar days of termination that Sparkling has destroyed or has returned to Garman all Software, Documentation and Codes.",
                "changed_text": "Sparkling may terminate this Agreement only in the event of a material breach by Garman that remains uncured for a period of sixty (60) days following written notice from Sparkling. If Sparkling terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 17(b), Sparkling shall cease using the Software at the end of the sixty (60) day notice period, and shall certify to Garman within fifteen (15) calendar days of termination that Sparkling has destroyed or has returned to Garman all Software, Documentation and Codes.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows Sparkling to terminate at any time with 90 days notice, while the modified clause restricts termination to instances of material breach by Garman, which must remain uncured after 60 days notice. This introduces conflicting grounds for termination and different timelines, creating uncertainty about termination rights and obligations.",

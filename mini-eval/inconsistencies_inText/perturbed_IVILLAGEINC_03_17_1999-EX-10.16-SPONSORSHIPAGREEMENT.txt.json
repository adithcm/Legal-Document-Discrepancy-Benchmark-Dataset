                "explanation": "The original text states that payments should be made within ten (10) days after the end of each calendar quarter for both 1999 and 2000. The modified text introduces a contradiction by changing the payment deadline to thirty (30) days for 1999 and fifteen (15) days for 2000. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment terms and could lead to disputes regarding late fees or breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that FMM must indicate acceptance or rejection of the renewal proposal no later than August 31, 2000. The modified text introduces a conflict by stating that FMM should indicate acceptance or rejection no later than July 31, 2000. This in-text contradiction creates ambiguity regarding the actual deadline for responding to the renewal proposal. The second date of August 31st remains creating confusion and a contradiction.",

The modified text directly contradicts this by stating iVillage has no obligation to make good lost impressions. This creates a direct conflict regarding iVillage's responsibility to compensate for downtime, which is further compounded with the original text still remaining within the section. This could cause a dispute regarding whether iVillage is liable to compensate Ford for lost advertising opportunities due to network or site downtime.",

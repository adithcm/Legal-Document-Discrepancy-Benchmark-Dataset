                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that amendments on Schedule 13D are *not* included in the agreement for joint filing, while the original text states that they *are* included. This creates uncertainty as to whether Schedule 13D amendments require individual filing or are covered by the joint agreement, leading to potential compliance issues and legal disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a minor contradiction by changing Adam D. Portnoy's title at ABP TRUST from 'President' to 'CEO'. While seemingly small, this creates uncertainty about his official capacity and authority within the ABP TRUST, potentially affecting the validity of his signature and the agreement's enforceability if internal company structures demand different authorization based on these titles.",

                "original_text": "4. Fees for Customizations:\n\n[SPECIFY TIME AND MATERIALS RATES ([Indicate any \"not to exceed\" limit on T&M Customization costs) OR FIXED PRICE]\n\nIf the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may terminate this Schedule and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder.",

Fees for Customizations:\n\n[SPECIFY TIME AND MATERIALS RATES ([Indicate any \"not to exceed\" limit on T&M Customization costs) OR FIXED PRICE]\n\nIf the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may terminate this Schedule and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, Bank of America may not terminate this schedule if the increased price is related to changes in law or regulation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that Bank of America may terminate the schedule and receive a refund if the price increases at any time after the delivery of detailed specifications. The added sentence creates a contradiction by stating that Bank of America may *not* terminate the schedule if the price increase is due to changes in law or regulation. This introduces ambiguity about Bank of America's termination rights and creates uncertainty about enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Section 6 originally mandates specific Delivery and Installation Dates. The addition of a clause stating the Supplier isn't liable for delays exceeding 30 days from the specified Delivery Date introduces a contradiction. The initial dates appear firm, but the added clause weakens their enforceability, creating confusion as to whether the original dates are hard deadlines or simply targets. This generates uncertainty over the supplier's obligations and potential penalties for late delivery/installation.",

However, for all projects initiated after January 1, 2025, payments are due within 60 days of invoice receipt.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation adds conflicting payment terms. The first sentence establishes a general guideline of adding special payment schedules in this section. Then, the second sentence imposes a 30-day payment deadline. The sentence thereafter states payments are due in 60 days for the projects initiated after January 1, 2025. This introduction creates an in-text contradiction by establishing a general 30-day rule, and then, 60-day rule, which makes it unclear as to what deadline should be followed depending on the project type and initiation date.",

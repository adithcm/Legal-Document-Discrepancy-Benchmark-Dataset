                "changed_text": "7.2 Termination (a) Should either Party fail to observe faithfully and materially perform each of the material obligations assumed by it in this IP Agreement for thirty (30) days after its attention has been directed to any such breach by notice in writing from the other Party, the non-breaching Party shall, at its option, have the right to terminate the license granted by it under this Agreement, such termination to be effected by serving notice in writing upon the breaching Party to that effect immediately after such breach.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the termination timeframe. The original clause requires a 30-day notice period for the breaching party to remedy the breach before termination can be effected. The modified clause allows for immediate termination upon breach, creating uncertainty about the required notice period.",

There are no Liens on any of the Transferred Patents. (For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that SONY's licensees under Portfolio Cross Licenses already hold licenses to the Transferred Patents and do not need a license from PURCHASER to practice the Transferred Patents.)",

There are no Liens on any of the Transferred Patents.

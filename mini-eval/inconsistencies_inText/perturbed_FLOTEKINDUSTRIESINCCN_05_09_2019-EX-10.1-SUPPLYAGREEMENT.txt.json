                "explanation": "Changing the payment due date from 60 to 30 days creates a direct conflict, leading to uncertainty regarding which payment deadline should be enforced. This is a contradiction within the payment terms, leading to potential disputes.",

Termination.\n\n(a) Either Flotek or FCC may terminate the Term immediately, upon a written notice to the other such party, when one of the following events occurs:\n\n(i) When the other Party materially violates one or more clause set forth herein or violates one or more purchase order relating to this Agreement and does not remedy such violation within 30 days from receiving the written notice from the other party of such fact (\"Cure Period\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand that the postponing of the delivery of the Terpene Product pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement, shall not be a cause for termination of the Term.",

Termination.\n\n(a) Either Flotek or FCC may terminate the Term immediately, upon a written notice to the other such party, when one of the following events occurs:\n\n(i) When the other Party materially violates one or more clause set forth herein or violates one or more purchase order relating to this Agreement and does not remedy such violation within 15 days from receiving the written notice from the other party of such fact (\"Cure Period\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand that the postponing of the delivery of the Terpene Product pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement, shall not be a cause for termination of the Term.",
                "explanation": "Changing the cure period from 30 days to 15 days contradicts the time frame the violating party has to remedy the breach. This discrepancy introduces ambiguity and can lead to disagreements on whether termination is justified if the issue is fixed between 16-30 days.",

                "explanation": "The original text states FCC *may not* assign rights. The modified text now states FCC *may* assign rights *with written consent from Flotek*, contradicting the former absolute restriction. The conflicting statements introduce ambiguity and can result in arguments about whether FCC can assign rights and, if so, under what conditions.",

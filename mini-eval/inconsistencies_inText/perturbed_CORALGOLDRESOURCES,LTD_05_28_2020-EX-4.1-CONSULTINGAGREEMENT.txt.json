                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by stating the consulting fee is payable up to January 31, 2025 and the Compensation Committee may decide on increments and then adding that the fee can be adjusted by the Company's sole discretion, even downwards, which undermines the original intent to pay a specific amount monthly, creating ambiguity on the payment terms.",

                "explanation": "This edit introduces conflicting termination clauses. Initially, the agreement outlines specific termination conditions (3 months notice from Consultant or Company, or Change of Control). By adding subclause (c), either party can terminate 'at any time, without cause or penalty.' This directly contradicts the other termination conditions which involve notice periods and/or termination payments for the Company, creating legal ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original section lacks specific deadlines for payments. The modified section introduces deadlines for each payment (15 days, 60 days after first payment, 30 days after completion), but these are not consistent. It is unclear whether completion means acceptance of deliverables, creating ambiguity about the 'trigger' for the final payment deadline. Also, the different number of days after create inconsistencies.",

                "explanation": "The original clause 6.3(b) states a 60-day period for corrective action. The modified clause changes this period to 90 days, creating a contradiction. This inconsistency creates uncertainty regarding the actual time allowed for a breaching party to remedy a violation before the non-breaching party can terminate the agreement.",

However, for trade secrets, this period shall extend indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "Section 7.3 initially specifies a five-year confidentiality period. The modification states a five-year period but adds that trade secrets are protected indefinitely. The term 'Confidential Information' in 7.2 includes trade secrets. It's therefore uncertain whether the five-year limit applies to trade secrets, or they are protected indefinitely regardless. The original agreement defines a finite five year date from disclosure, and the changed excerpt includes both this language and an indefinite requirement creating two contradictory guidelines.",

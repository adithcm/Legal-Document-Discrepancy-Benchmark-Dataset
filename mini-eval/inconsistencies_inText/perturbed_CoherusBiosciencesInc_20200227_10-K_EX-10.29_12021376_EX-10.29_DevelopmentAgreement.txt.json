Bioeq shall invoice Licensee for all royalties due per calendar quarter promptly after Bioeq receives Licensee's royalty report for such calendar quarter to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.3.2. All amounts of royalties shown to have accrued by each report provided pursuant to Section 7.3.2 above shall be due and payable within [***] ([***]) days from receipt by Licensee of Bioeq's invoice.",

Bioeq shall invoice Licensee for all royalties due per calendar quarter promptly after Bioeq receives Licensee's royalty report for such calendar quarter to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.3.2. All amounts of royalties shown to have accrued by each report provided pursuant to Section 7.3.2 above shall be due and payable within [***] ([***]) days from the end of the calendar quarter for which the royalties are reported, irrespective of when Licensee receives Bioeq's invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that royalty payments are due a fixed number of days after the end of the calendar quarter, regardless of when the invoice is received. The original text says payment is due a certain number of days after the invoice is received, creating a conflict.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Section 3.5.1 states payments are due within 45 days of the quarter's close, but section 3.5.2 originally stated that interest accrues after 30 days of their due date. Now section 3.5.2 states that interest will accrue after 60 days of their due date. This means that the party has 45 days to make payment, however, the party will not incur interest until day 60, this creates a contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Earlier, the contract stated that interest would accrue after 60 days of non-payment, after the initial 45 day period of payment. Now, this modified section states that non-payment is not considered a breach until 90 days have passed. This contradicts section 3.5.2, which implies action can be taken, or at least interest accrues, after 60 days. This creates uncertainty about when a breach actually occurs, leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by reversing the limitations period for general actions and actions of non-payment. The original text stated a one-year limit for general actions and a two-year limit for non-payment actions. Now, it states a two-year limit for general actions and a one-year limit for non-payment actions. This creates confusion and uncertainty, especially in cases involving both general breaches and non-payment, making it unclear which limitation period applies and when legal action must be initiated.",

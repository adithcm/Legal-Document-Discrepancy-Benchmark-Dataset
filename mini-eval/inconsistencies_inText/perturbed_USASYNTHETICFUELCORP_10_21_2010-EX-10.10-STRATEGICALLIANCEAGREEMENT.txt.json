Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Global Energy, as applicable, at the applicable account designated by Global Energy, as follows:                                           Bank:     PNC Bank, N.A.                               Cincinnati, OH                          ABA No.:     042000398                          Account No.:     40-7690-5189                          Account Name:    Global Energy, Inc.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Payment. Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made no later than thirty (30) days from the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Global Energy, as applicable, at the applicable account designated by Global Energy, as follows:                                           Bank:     PNC Bank, N.A.

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction because Section 1(b) initially requires payment on the Closing Date, while the modification allows payment up to thirty days after the Closing Date. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual payment deadline, potentially leading to disputes over late payment penalties.",

                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the renewal term from five years to two years. This will cause confusion and disputes regarding the duration of the agreement after the initial term.",

For purposes of this definition, \"control\" when used with respect to any specified Person means the power to direct the management and policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the terms \"controlling\" and \"controlled\" have meanings correlative to the foregoing.",

For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" when used with respect to any specified Person means influence over the decisions of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through a contractual business relationship, or otherwise, and the terms \"controlling\" and \"controlled\" have meanings correlative to the foregoing.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by changing the definition of 'control' from 'power to direct the management and policies' to 'influence over the decisions'. The term 'control' is now based on influence and contractual business relationship instead of ownership. This creates ambiguity about the rights and obligations of affiliates.",

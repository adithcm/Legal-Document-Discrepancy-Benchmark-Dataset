                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by altering the final payment due date from August 31, 2008, to September 15, 2008. This conflicts with Section 3(a) of the General Provisions, which imposes interest on payments not received within fifteen (15) days after the 'dates set forth therein' (referring to the Agreement Summary). It is now unclear when the final payment must be received to avoid interest penalties.",

                "changed_text": "Any payment due pursuant to this Section that is not received by SDBF within thirty (30) days after such payment is due shall bear interest from the date the payment was due until paid, at a per annum rate of interest equal to the prime rate of interest as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus five (5) percentage points, or if such interest rate is not permitted by applicable law, at the highest non-usurious interest rate permitted by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the grace period for payments before interest accrues, from 15 days to 30 days. This conflicts directly with Section 12, Default, which states that failure to pay within fifteen (15) days is a default. Now, the grace period until a payment is considered a default has been extended and creates conflict with remedies and definitions",

                "explanation": "This changes the default clause to give the sponsor the right to recovery or offset of amounts paid to SDBF. Given the previous payment inconsistency perturbation, if the last payment is not paid within the time frame, this change creates a problem for SDBF because the changed text states the Sponsor can request amounts paid. In other words, this section nullifies the intent of the contract.",

                "changed_text": "With respect to any Party to this Agreement shall mean any company, corporation, firm, individual or other  entity which is affiliated with such Party, or whose products or services are endorsed by such Party, or which shares resources with such Party. This definition shall apply regardless of whether formal control exists.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by broadening the definition of 'Affiliate.' The original definition focuses on control. The modified definition includes entities based on affiliation or endorsement, regardless of control. This creates ambiguity, as sections that rely on the original control-based definition will now conflict with the expanded definition.",

However, EKR, at its sole discretion, can defer royalty payments up to ninety (90) days after the end of each quarter if EKR deems its cash flow insufficient.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct conflict in payment terms. The original clause mandates payment within 45 days. The modification grants EKR the option to defer payments up to 90 days based on its cash flow. This creates uncertainty about the payment deadline and introduces potential disputes.",

However, EKR may destroy all records related to sales older than two (2) years for ease of storage.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding record retention. The original clause requires records to be maintained for six years. The modified text allows for the destruction of records older than two years. This introduces uncertainty about the availability of records for audits and disputes.",

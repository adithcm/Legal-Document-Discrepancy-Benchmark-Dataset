Where the Joint Venture is entered for a fixed term and the Joint Venture continues after the expiration of that term then in the absence of an express new agreement, the rights and duties of the Participants remain the same as they were at the expiration of that term so far as those terms are consistent with a Joint Venture at will.",
                "changed_text": "The Joint Venture is a fixed term Joint Venture beginning November 27, 2018 and ending November 30th, 2019 or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 90 days prior to the end of the then-current term. Where the Joint Venture is entered for a fixed term and the Joint Venture continues after the expiration of that term then in the absence of an express new agreement, the rights and duties of the Participants remain the same as they were at the expiration of that term so far as those terms are consistent with a Joint Venture at will.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Joint Venture's term. The original text defines it as a fixed term ending on November 30, 2019, while the added sentence stipulates automatic renewal unless terminated with 90 days notice. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration and termination process. It is unclear whether a party needs to take action to continue the joint venture beyond the initial term or if inaction leads to automatic renewal.",

Such a vote requires a simple majority.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the effect of a voluntary withdrawal. Initially, a withdrawal automatically dissolves the Joint Venture. The added clause, however, states that it only triggers a vote, creating ambiguity. This affects the rights and obligations of the participants and introduces uncertainty about the conditions under which the Joint Venture can be dissolved.",

However, for decisions regarding financial matters outlined in Section 12, votes will be weighted according to each Participant's Capital Contributions.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting voting mechanisms. The original text establishes that each participant receives one vote of equal weight. The added text specifies that for financial decisions outlined in Section 12, votes are instead weighted according to Capital Contributions. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding which voting method applies in different situations.",

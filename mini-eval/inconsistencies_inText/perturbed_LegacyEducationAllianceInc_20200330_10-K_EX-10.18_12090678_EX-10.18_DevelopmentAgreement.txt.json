                "original_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 15 days after the end of the applicable month. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "9.3 Base Royalties and Marketing Royalties shall be paid monthly to T&M within 15 days after the end of the applicable month, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both parties. Payments will be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency regarding the payment deadline. Section 9.3 originally states that royalties must be paid within 15 days. By adding 'unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both parties', the clause becomes contradictory, as it allows for payment deadlines to be altered, creating uncertainty and potential for dispute.",

                "changed_text": "11.2 The Agreement may be terminated: (i) immediately by either party in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the other party that is susceptible of cure and such breach is not cured within the 30-day period after written notice of such breach to the breaching party, unless the breaching party can demonstrate substantial progress towards curing the breach, in which case the cure period shall be extended to 60 days.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the termination clause. Initially, a breach must be cured within 30 days to avoid immediate termination. However, the modified clause allows for a 60-day extension if the breaching party shows 'substantial progress', introducing subjectivity and uncertainty about when termination can actually occur.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement without the other party's prior written consent in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, change in control, or sale of substantially all of the assets or business of such assigning party. Any assignment in conflict with this provision shall be void.",
                "changed_text": "14.9 No Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the other party's prior written consent. Any assignment in conflict with this provision shall be void, unless the assigning party offers the non-assigning party first right of refusal, which must be exercised within 10 days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement without the other party's prior written consent in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, change in control, or sale of substantially all of the assets or business of such assigning party.",
                "explanation": "The inserted phrase introduces a potential conflict with the original intent regarding assignment. The original clause outlines scenarios where consent is not needed. Now, offering a 'first right of refusal' introduces a conditionality and a new 10-day timeframe which is not originally outlined in the conditions where written consent is not required.",

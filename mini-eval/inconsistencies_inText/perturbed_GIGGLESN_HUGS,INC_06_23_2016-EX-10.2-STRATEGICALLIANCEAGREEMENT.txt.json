                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating the agreement can be terminated after 3 years by either party, but then allowing the Consultant to terminate at any time with 30 days notice. This creates uncertainty regarding the termination clause.",

The timing of this issuance is at the sole discretion of the company's board.",
                "explanation": "This change creates ambiguity. The original text suggests a clear obligation, but the added clause introduces uncertainty about when the warrant will be issued, potentially conflicting with the consultant's understanding of timely compensation.",

This limitation is not intended to limit the Company's right to prevent misappropriation of its Confidential Information beyond the non-solicitation period.",

This limitation is not intended to limit the Company's right to prevent misappropriation of its Confidential Information beyond the non-solicitation period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the non-solicitation period shall only apply if the Consultant has been employed for at least two (2) years.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts the original non-solicitation clause. Originally, the non-solicitation applied during the term and for one year after. The added sentence introduces a condition that the non-solicitation only applies if the consultant has been employed for at least two years. This creates uncertainty on whether the non-solicitation clause is valid if the consultant is employed for less than two years, leading to potential disputes.",

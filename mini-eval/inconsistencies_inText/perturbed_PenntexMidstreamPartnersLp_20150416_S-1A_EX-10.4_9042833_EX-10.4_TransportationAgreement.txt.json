Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter's invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties.

On or before the fifteenth (15th) calendar Day of each Month, Transporter shall provide to Customer an invoice and statement for the previous Month setting forth the calculation of the net amount due hereunder to Transporter for the Services provided hereunder during such previous Month.\n\nPayment of Statements.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment terms. Initially, payment is expected within 15 days of invoice receipt; now, it is changed to 30 days. The clause 'If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar Days' of written notice from Transporter to Customer' still refers back to the original 15-day period, creating ambiguity regarding the cure period and overall payment deadline. This contradiction creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes the notice period required for termination of the agreement from thirty (30) to ninety (90) calendar days.

Provider shall submit or cause to be submitted to Recipient in writing, within 15 days after the end of each month, an invoice setting forth the Fees for the Services provided to Recipient during such month in reasonable detail, as applicable, due under such invoice. Section 5.4 Payment. Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice no later than the last business day of the month Recipient received such invoice unless disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline and when interest accrues. Section 5.4 initially states payment is due by the last business day of the month the invoice is received. The revised text states that payment is due 30 days after receipt of the invoice. Furthermore, interest was initially applied if amounts were not received by the due date. The modified text states that interest only applies if amounts are not received within 15 days of the due date. This discrepancy could lead to disputes about when payments are considered late and when interest applies.",

With respect to each of the Services, the term thereof will be for a period commencing as of the date hereof, unless a different date is specified as the commencement date for any applicable Service on Exhibit A or Exhibit B (either, a \"Commencement Date\"), and shall continue until 12 months following the Commencement Date unless (i) such other date as is specified as the termination date for any applicable Service in this Agreement or on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable (the \"Term\") or (ii) earlier terminated pursuant to this Agreement (a \"Termination Date\").",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the term and termination of services, specifically for services defined in Exhibit A, section G1.4. While Section 6.1 initially sets the term as 12 months following the Commencement Date, the addition states that services in Exhibit A, section G1.4, automatically renew unless a notice of non-renewal is provided. This creates a contradiction as to whether the term is definitively 12 months or can be extended without explicit agreement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting termination notice periods. The main clause states a 30-day notice is required for termination of services. However, the added clause specifies that services described in Exhibit A sections G2 and G3 require a 60-day written notice. This creates an in-text contradiction, causing uncertainty about which notice period applies to which services and increasing the potential for disputes.",

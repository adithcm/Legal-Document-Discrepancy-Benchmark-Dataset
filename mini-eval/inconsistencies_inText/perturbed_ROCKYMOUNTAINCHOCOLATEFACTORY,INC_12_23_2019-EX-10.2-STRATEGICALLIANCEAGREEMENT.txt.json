                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict in the filing deadlines for different types of registration statements. The original text specifies 90 days for Eligible Resale Registration Statements and 30 days for Resale Shelf Registration Statements. By swapping these deadlines, it creates uncertainty about which deadline applies, making it an in-text contradiction.",

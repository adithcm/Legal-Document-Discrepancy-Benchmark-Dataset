                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by establishing a standard payment deadline while also creating a separate, longer payment period for invoices above a specific threshold. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as it is unclear which deadline applies to invoices exceeding $[***].",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the term. Initially, it states that certain payment obligations extend beyond the Expiration Date, but a new sentence is added to state that *all* obligations expire on the Expiration Date. This creates a direct conflict and makes it unclear whether the payment terms survive the agreement's termination.",

                "explanation": "The change removes 'or the Product Label and Insert' from the final sentence. The original clause provided an exception for statements within the promotional materials or product label/insert. The revised clause eliminates the product label/insert exception, making it unclear if statements contained solely within the product label and insert are subject to the restrictions in section 11.5.1. This contradiction introduces uncertainty about which claims are allowed. Removing the exception makes the responsibilities unclear, so the sales representatives may be penalized for the comments.",

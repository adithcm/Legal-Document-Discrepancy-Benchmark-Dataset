Payment. EDGE shall pay Subcontractor for Work completed in accordance with the related Exhibit or individual Purchase Order within 90 days of acceptance by Subcontractor.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Section 4.A establishes that payment is based on agreed-upon prices. However, Section 4.B originally stated EDGE shall pay Subcontractor for completed work. By adding a 'within 90 days' clause, it creates a contradiction as it does not clarify when the payment should start for the subcontractor.",

However, Subcontractor will follow subcontracting requirements and processes of EDGE and provide joint access to subcontractor database and information concerning quality control.

Furthermore, subcontractors require explicit permission from EDGE to ensure compliance with internal processes.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence creates a contradiction. The original text says the Subcontractor is permitted to subcontract without written notification. The addition of the last sentence now indicates subcontractors need permission from EDGE. This contradicts the first sentence and causes confusion.

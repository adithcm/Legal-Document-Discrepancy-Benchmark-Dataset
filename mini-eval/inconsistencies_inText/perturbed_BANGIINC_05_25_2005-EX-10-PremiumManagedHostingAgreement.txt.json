This could contradict the overall guarantee, as scheduled maintenance could technically fall under the 99% uptime guarantee's interpretation, creating ambiguity on its enforcement.",

The addition of 'phone support response time is not guaranteed and may be subject to delays' directly contradicts the 24x7 aspect, causing uncertainty about the actual availability and responsiveness of the phone support.",

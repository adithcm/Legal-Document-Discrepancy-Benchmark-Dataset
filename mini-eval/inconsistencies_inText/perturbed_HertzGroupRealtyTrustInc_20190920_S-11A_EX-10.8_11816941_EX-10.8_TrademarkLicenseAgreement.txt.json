                "original_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the ability to influence, directly or indirectly, the decisions of a person or entity, whether through ownership, contract, or other means. However, for purposes of Article 3 regarding termination, 'Control' shall strictly mean ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Control'. While 1.5 broadens the definition of control to encompass influence, the added sentence in Article 3 narrows it for termination purposes, creating uncertainty about when termination clauses are triggered. This creates an in-text contradiction when Article 3 is referenced.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding the termination notice period. The initial clause states 30 days for either party, while the added sentence requires 90 days notice if the Licensee terminates within the first year. This causes uncertainty regarding the correct notice period.",

Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' own expense, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, expense or liability (including attorneys' fees and costs), to the extent that the foregoing (a) is based on a claim resulting solely from any service provided or offered by Licensed Users, (b) results from a material breach, or is based on a claim that, if true, would be a material breach, of this Agreement by Licensed Users, or (c) is based upon Licensed Users' unauthorized or improper use of the Licensed Mark.",

Licensed Users, at Licensed Users' own expense, shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensor, its affiliates, successors and assigns, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, against any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, expense or liability (including attorneys' fees and costs), to the extent that the foregoing (a) is based on a claim resulting solely from any service provided or offered by Licensed Users, (b) results from a material breach, or is based on a claim that, if true, would be a material breach, of this Agreement by Licensed Users, or (c) is based upon Licensed Users' unauthorized or improper use of the Licensed Mark. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor shall be solely responsible for any claims arising from its own gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the indemnification clause. While the first part of the clause requires the Licensee to indemnify the Licensor under certain circumstances, the added sentence states that the Licensor is solely responsible for claims arising from its own gross negligence. This is a conflict because it isn't clear if the Licensee also has to indemnify the Licensor for its gross negligence, or if it is exclusively the Licensor's responsibility.",

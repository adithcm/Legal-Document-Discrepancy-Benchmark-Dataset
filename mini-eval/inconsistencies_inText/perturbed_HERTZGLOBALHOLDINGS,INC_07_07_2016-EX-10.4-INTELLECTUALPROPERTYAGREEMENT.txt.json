Notwithstanding Section 1.2, HERC may, at its sole discretion, extend the Interim Period for an additional two (2) years by providing written notice to THC and HSI at least six (6) months prior to the original expiration date. All terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during such extended period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the duration of the 'Interim Period.' Section 1.2 initially defines it as a fixed four-year period. However, Section 8.5 allows HERC to unilaterally extend this period by an additional two years. This creates uncertainty about the actual length of the Interim Period and the rights and obligations tied to its duration.",

In the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may notify HERC of such material breach and terminate this Agreement upon written notice. If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).\n\n8.2 By THC or HSI Immediately. THC or HSI shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement if HERC: (i) becomes insolvent, or (ii) files a petition in bankruptcy or is adjudicated a bankrupt, or if a petition in bankruptcy is filed against HERC and not dismissed within thirty (30) days, or (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or an arrangement pursuant to any bankruptcy law, or (iv) discontinues its business, or (v) causes or suffers a receiver to be appointed for it or its business and such receiver has not been discharged within thirty (30) days after the date of appointment thereof",

HERC may terminate this agreement at any time, for any reason, with thirty (30) days written notice to THC and HSI. Upon termination, all rights and licenses granted to HERC hereunder shall immediately cease, except for those related to HERC's use of the HERC trademarks.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding termination rights. Sections 8.1 and 8.2 detail specific conditions under which THC or HSI can terminate the agreement, often related to HERC's breach or insolvency. However, Section 8.6 grants HERC the unilateral right to terminate the agreement 'at any time, for any reason' with only 30 days' notice. This conflicts with the more restrictive termination clauses for THC and HSI, creating uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement can be ended.",

Notwithstanding Section 9, HERC shall be permitted to engage in the business of renting or leasing cars, crossovers, or light trucks in any geographic area, provided that the aggregate annual revenue from such activities does not exceed $1,000,000 USD. This exception is granted without the need for THC's prior written consent.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by creating an exception to the non-competition clause. Section 9 broadly restricts HERC from engaging in vehicle rental business in areas where THC operates without consent. Section 9.1 introduces an exception, allowing HERC to engage in such activities up to a certain revenue threshold ($1,000,000 USD) without needing THC's consent. This creates ambiguity regarding the scope and enforcement of the non-competition restriction. It is unclear if THC's consent is required for any activity, or only for activities exceeding the revenue threshold.",

        "explanation": "This section is contradictory and structurally flawed. It states that due dates are guaranteed by the Company regardless of whether the company receives required materials, documentation, or approvals in a timely fashion from the client, and that Delays will not affect the due dates. This doesn't make sense because in order for work to be completed, documentation has to be provided by the client. This would render it impossible for the company to meet the deadline.",

        "explanation": "This section is contradictory. It initially states that the remaining balance of $3,100 is due 'on completion of the Scope of Work.' However, the added sentence allows the client to pay 'at any time, or in multiple installments, before the Scope of Work completion.'

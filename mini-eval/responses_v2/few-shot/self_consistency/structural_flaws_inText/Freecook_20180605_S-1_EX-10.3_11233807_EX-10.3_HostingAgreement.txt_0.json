        "section": "Client acknowledges and agrees that all due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are guaranteed by the Company, regardless of whether the company receives required materials, documentation, or approvals in a timely fashion from the client. Delays will not affect the due dates.",
        "explanation": "This clause presents an illogical and practically impossible scenario. It states that the company guarantees due dates regardless of whether they receive necessary inputs from the client. This is a contradiction because the company's ability to meet deadlines is inherently dependent on the client's timely cooperation. It's structurally flawed because guaranteed due dates are only based on the Company. Delays will affect the due dates and it is incorrect.",

        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity regarding payment terms. The clause initially states that the remaining $3,100 is due on completion of the Scope of Work. However, the added sentence allows the client to pay at any time or in installments before completion. This creates conflicting understandings of the final payment schedule and due date, creating inconsistencies.",

        "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the company's obligation to provide customer service. The original text states that the company 'is obligated to continue providing' customer service and 'may not alter or cease providing' it. The added sentence allows the company to 'at any time alter or cease providing' customer service at its sole discretion, contradicting the initial obligation. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty for the client regarding the availability of customer service, and is inconsistent.",

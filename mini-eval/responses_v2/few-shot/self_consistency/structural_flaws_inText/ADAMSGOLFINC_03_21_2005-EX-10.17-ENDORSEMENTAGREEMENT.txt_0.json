        "explanation": "This clause defines \"ENDORSEMENT\" extremely narrowly, limiting it to the use of the consultant's name only. This creates a structural flaw in the text as the limited definition makes the overall marketing and endorsement plan ineffective.",

However, the clause goes on to state that, CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs.

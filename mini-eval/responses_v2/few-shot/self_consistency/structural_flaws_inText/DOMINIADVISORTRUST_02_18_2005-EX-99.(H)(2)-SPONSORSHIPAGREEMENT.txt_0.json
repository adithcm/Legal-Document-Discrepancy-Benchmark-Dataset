        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit Domini's liability for subcontractors to the extent of the subcontractor's liability insurance coverage. However, it also states that Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services. This creates ambiguity because if a subcontractor's act or omission *is* within the scope of contracted services, the limitation of liability to the insurance coverage may be interpreted as the *only* extent of Domini's liability, even for things Domini should be responsible for.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction. The first sentence states the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty'. However, the very next sentence states that there *is* a penalty if the Sponsor terminates within the first year. This is a clear contradiction that needs clarification.",

As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a structural flaw where it uses the same term 'Sponsor' to define the Sponsor, but then goes on to state that the term includes Domini and its affiliates. It should define Domini and its affiliates initially before discussing the limitation of liability.",

        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image solely in ADAMS GOLF'S internal documentation.",
        "explanation": "This definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is unusually restrictive. Typically, an endorsement agreement grants rights to use the endorser's attributes for public-facing advertising and promotion. Limiting the use to \"internal documentation\" contradicts the overall purpose of the agreement as stated in the WITNESSETH clause, which expresses ADAMS GOLF's desire to use the Consultant's endorsement \"in connection with the advertisement and promotion\" of their product. This internal contradiction significantly undermines the value of the endorsement to Adams Golf.",

        "section": "B.\"PRODUCT\" shall mean only metal woods and drivers.",
        "explanation": "While defining 'PRODUCT' itself isn't inherently a contradiction, it becomes one when considered in conjunction with other clauses. For instance, clause 5 requires the CONSULTANT to exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. However, MANDATORY PRODUCTS are defined in 2.C and includes other ADAMS GOLF products like [*****] (which implicitly aren't metal woods or drivers). This creates an inconsistency: The consultant's exclusivity obligation extends beyond the defined 'PRODUCT'.",

        "explanation": "The added clause 'unless CONSULTANT acts in a manner that brings additional media attention to the ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT' creates a loophole. It suggests that if the CONSULTANT's behavior, even if morally questionable, generates media attention for ADAMS GOLF's product, it is acceptable. This contradicts the initial expectation of maintaining public morals and conventions and introduces a dangerous ambiguity.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph regarding the 'Duties of the Sponsor' contains contradictory statements. It initially states the Sponsor performs oversight, administrative, and management services. However, the 'Notwithstanding the foregoing' clause contradicts this by stating the Sponsor is NOT responsible for the management of the Trust's assets, investment advice, supervision, or distribution of shares. This creates ambiguity as to the actual scope of the Sponsor's duties.",

        "explanation": "The structure of section 2 begins by stating that Domini is responsible for salaries and wages, but then goes on to state that the Trust is responsible for ALL of its operating expenses.

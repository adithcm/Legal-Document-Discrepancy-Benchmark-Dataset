        "section": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Web site\" shall mean a collection of interconnected webpages residing on the internet. A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites. The term \"Hosted Site\" shall mean the online portal of the Customer that is hosted by i-on under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Web site' is too broad. It doesn't specify that the 'Web site' being referred to is the customer's web site. It can also be interpreted as i-on's own web site, even though the second sentence states a web site may exist on a single computer with other web sites, which can also refer to i-on. This contrasts with the definition of 'Hosted Site', which specifically refers to the Customer's online portal. This inconsistency can create confusion about which web site the agreement is referring to in different sections.",

The subscriber is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The use of both \"Customer\" and \"subscriber\" to refer to the same entity creates a misalignment. The contract does not define subscriber. While it is likely the parties intend the terms to mean the same thing, using two different terms creates unnecessary ambiguity and introduces an in-text contradiction.",

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",
        "explanation": "Again, the contract uses both the terms \"Client\" and \"Customer\", creating a misalignment, since both are not defined. This introduces a possible in-text contradiction.",

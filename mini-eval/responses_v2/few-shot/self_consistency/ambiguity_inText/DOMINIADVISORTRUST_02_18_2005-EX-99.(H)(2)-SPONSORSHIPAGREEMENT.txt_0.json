        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section imposes an extremely high standard of liability on the Sponsor, making it liable even for simple errors of judgment. This contradicts the general legal principle that parties are usually only liable for negligence or intentional misconduct. Such a clause might be considered unconscionable or against public policy, particularly in the context of investment management where some level of risk and judgment is inherent.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the agreement may be terminated 'at any time' with a penalty. However, there is no clause regarding what happens if the contract is terminated before 3 years. If the contract is terminated within 3 years, there is no way of knowing how to calculate the penalty. This introduces ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "This section states that Domini can subcontract without trustee approval and is only responsible for gross negligence of subcontractors. This contradicts the inherent fiduciary duty of the Sponsor (Domini) to act in the best interest of the Trust. By absolving itself of responsibility for ordinary negligence of subcontractors, the Sponsor weakens the protection afforded to the Trust's assets and operations.",

        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "The Sponsor is fully liable for any error, regardless of negligence or bad faith. This is too broad and likely unenforceable. A standard of 'gross negligence or willful misconduct' is typical and legally sound. Holding the Sponsor liable for simple errors of judgment, even without any fault, is an extreme burden and contradicts common legal principles. This would make it difficult for the Sponsor to operate.",

        "explanation": "The agreement indicates that it can be terminated at any time by either party, as long as a 60 days notice is given and a penalty equal to one year of management fees has been paid. However, typically, agreements do not get penalized for terminating a contract. It is contradictory to state it can be terminated 'at any time', but requires a penalty. This will also make it difficult for the Board of Trustees to find new management, as the penalty is very high.",

        "explanation": "This clause has two concerning components. First, Domini can subcontract without the need of approval. Secondly, the degree of liabilty is very low with gross negligence. Usually a Subcontracting clause includes: (1) it is normal to get the Board of Trustees approval. (2) that Domini is responsible for all acts and ommissions.",

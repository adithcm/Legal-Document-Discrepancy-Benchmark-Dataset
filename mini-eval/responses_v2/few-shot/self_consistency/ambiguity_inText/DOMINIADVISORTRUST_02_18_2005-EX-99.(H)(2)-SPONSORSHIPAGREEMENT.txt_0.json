        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This limitation of liability clause contradicts general legal principles. It attempts to make the Sponsor fully liable even for errors of judgment without gross negligence or bad faith. This is an extremely high standard of liability that is difficult to enforce under most state and federal laws, which usually require some level of culpability (negligence, gross negligence, or intent) for liability to attach. Therefore, it could be deemed unenforceable or against public policy.",

        "explanation": "The clause states that Domini is not 'fully responsible' for the acts of subcontractors, only being responsible for gross negligence. This conflicts with the duty of care Domini owes to the Trust, potentially violating fiduciary duty. Additionally, it is unclear what standard a court would apply to determine 'full responsibility' versus 'gross negligence'.",

        "explanation": "The text states that the agreement can be terminated by either party 'at any time, with the payment of a penalty equal to one year of the average management fees collected over the prior three years'. The contradiction is that the agreement implies that the agreement is a one time deal, and yet has an annual 'management fee'. The phrase, 'one year of the average management fees collected over the prior three years' does not make sense if the agreement is a one time payment.",

Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an internal inconsistency. While it 'guarantees' a delivery timeframe, it also states that due dates 'are not subject to any delay'. This creates confusion: guarantees imply potential compensation for missed deadlines, but the 'no delay' clause suggests that any deviation from the timeline is acceptable, negating the guarantee.",

        "explanation": "The term \"reasonable sum\" is ambiguous in text. It does not specify the criteria or method for determining reasonableness. The section contradicts Section 2 (Payment Terms) where a fixed price of $5,000 is agreed on. This section lacks structure as it is not clear on how to quantify the \"reasonable sum\".",

Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay.",
        "explanation": "The statement that 'any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay' is structurally flawed and not practical. Unforeseen circumstances, such as illness, natural disasters, or unavoidable technical issues, can cause delays. A blanket statement prohibiting any delay is not only unreasonable but also unenforceable in many jurisdictions.",

The surcharge for rush work may be different from the standard hourly rate.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'Client may be asked' introduces ambiguity regarding the circumstances under which a surcharge will be applied and what that surcharge might be. A structured agreement would provide clarity on how rush work will be charged and how to quantify such charges, as this could be used unfairly.",

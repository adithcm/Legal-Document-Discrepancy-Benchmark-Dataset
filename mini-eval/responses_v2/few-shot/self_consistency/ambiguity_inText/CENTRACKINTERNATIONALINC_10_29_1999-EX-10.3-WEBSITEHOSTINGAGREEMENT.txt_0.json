        "explanation": "The first sentence promises continuous operation (24/7/365), but the second sentence allows maintenance at i-on's convenience 'without prior notice.' This creates a contradiction, as 'continuous' implies no interruptions, yet maintenance can occur anytime, potentially disrupting service. The lack of prior notice further exacerbates the issue, leaving the customer unprepared for downtime.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'will not be responsible for maintaining such connectivity with the phone company and the Internet backbone access provider' contradicts the overall promise of providing 'connectivity to the Internet'. If i-on isn't responsible for maintaining the connection with essential providers, the provision of internet connectivity becomes uncertain and unreliable.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence mandates a fixed monthly fee of $450. However, the addition of the phrase \"prices subject to change with 30 day written notice\" introduces uncertainty and contradicts the fixed fee agreement. This allows i-on to change the price, making the initial fee unstable. This creates an inconsistency in the agreement.",

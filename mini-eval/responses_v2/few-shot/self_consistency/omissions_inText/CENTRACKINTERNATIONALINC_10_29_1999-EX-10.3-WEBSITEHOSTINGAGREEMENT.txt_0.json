        "section": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that i-on will maintain continuous operation except for reasonable maintenance, and will try to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours. However, the 'best efforts' qualifier makes the obligation vague. This vagueness creates uncertainty about the availability of the Hosted Site and potentially leads to disputes regarding what constitutes 'reasonable' maintenance or 'best efforts'.",

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",
        "explanation": "This clause requires the Customer to hold i-on harmless for service interruptions and data loss, even though the contract also states that i-on provides services to prevent data loss. This appears to exculpate i-on for failures to meet the standard of its service description.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",

        "explanation": "The Purpose of the Venture needs to be clearly defined to outline the objectives, scope, and limitations of the joint venture. By stating that the Purpose will be determined by the Managers, it creates ambiguity and potential for conflicting interpretations or changes to the venture's scope without the explicit agreement of all members. This lack of a well-defined Purpose can result in uncertainty about the venture's activities and create disputes among the members.",

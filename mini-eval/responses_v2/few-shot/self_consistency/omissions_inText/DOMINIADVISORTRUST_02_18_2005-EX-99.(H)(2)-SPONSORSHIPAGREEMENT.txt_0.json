        "section": "1. Duties of the Sponsor. Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The wording 'oversight, administrative, and management services as requested by the Trust' is ambiguous because it does not specify the scope or limits of the services. This creates uncertainty regarding the Sponsor's actual obligations, as the services are only defined as 'requested by the Trust', giving the Trust complete discretion.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "The term 'mutually agreed upon fee' is ambiguous because it does not specify how the fee is to be determined, when it will be reviewed, or what happens if the parties cannot agree on a fee. This lack of specificity could lead to disputes over compensation.",

        "explanation": "The language 'Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons' does not specify whether Domini needs the Trust's consent before subcontracting, or whether the subcontractors are bound by the same confidentiality and liability obligations as Domini. This omission creates uncertainty regarding the quality and security of the services provided.",

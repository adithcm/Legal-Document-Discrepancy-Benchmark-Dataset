Any email or telephone correspondence received after normal business hours will be processed the following business day. Client shall pay an additional surcharge for any services requiring work to be performed outside of normal business hours by reason of a rush deadline requested by Client or as a result of Client's failure to meet scheduled times for delivery and/or review and approval of information, content and materials. The surcharge for rush work shall be the hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%).",
        "explanation": "The text references an 'hourly rate' in Section 3 but it is never explicitly defined in the agreement. This leads to a lack of clarity on how much extra the client will be charged for any rush work. The client will need to be informed what this hourly rate is to avoid a breach of contract.",

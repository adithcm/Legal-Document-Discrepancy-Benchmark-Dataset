        "section": "The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence says that Domini will cover legal counsel fees, however the last sentence includes 'expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust' This contradicts the opening sentence, since the expenses of issuing, registration and qualification of shares would include legal counsel fees that Domini is supposed to cover.",

        "explanation": "This clause allows the agreement to be terminated 'at any time' but also requires 60 days written notice. These two conditions are in conflict because if an agreement is terminated 'at any time' there would be no 60 day written notice to the other party.",

        "explanation": "By stating that 'Domini is not responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor', Domini could be neglecting its obligations to the Trust. If the subcontractor does not satisfy their work duties or acts against the trust, Domini could not be held liable despite hiring the subcontractor. Thus, this could potentially damage the trust.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "There is a contradiction in the number of days required for notice and rectification of a breach. The clause states 'fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such thirty (30) day period'. This creates ambiguity as to whether a party has 15 or 30 days to rectify a breach after notice is given.",

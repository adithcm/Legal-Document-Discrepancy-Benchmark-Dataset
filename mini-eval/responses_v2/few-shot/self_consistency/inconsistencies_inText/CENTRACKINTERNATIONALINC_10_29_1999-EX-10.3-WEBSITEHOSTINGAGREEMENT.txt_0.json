        "explanation": "This section states that i-on will maintain the site continuously except for maintenance. However, it also states that i-on can schedule maintenance at any time of the day, including weekdays. This creates ambiguity as it's unclear when the site will actually be consistently available, thus making it difficult to enforce the uptime commitment.",

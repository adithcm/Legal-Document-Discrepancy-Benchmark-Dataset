        "explanation": "The contract states that i-on will maintain the Hosted Site continuously, 24/7/365. However, it also says i-on can perform maintenance anytime. This is contradicting since the maintenance would interrupt the continuous service that was defined in the first part.",

The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the payment terms, stating the fee amount, due date (20th of each month), and consequences of late payment (interruption/discontinuation of services). By removing the sentence about disconnection of service, there is no real reason why the customer would feel incentivized to pay on time, as they can pay at their lesiure.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",

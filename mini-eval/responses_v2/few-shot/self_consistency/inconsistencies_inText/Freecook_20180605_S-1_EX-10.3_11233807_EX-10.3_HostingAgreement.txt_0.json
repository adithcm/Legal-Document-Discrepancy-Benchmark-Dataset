Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The text includes conflicting statements regarding the project timeline. It first states that the company will use its best efforts to deliver within the 12-week timeframe, but then guarantees completion within 8 weeks, introducing an in-text contradiction about the expected completion date.",

        "explanation": "There is ambiguity and misalignment. By having 'The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower' is not structured properly. The additional surcharge would be both ($40 + 25% or $100).",

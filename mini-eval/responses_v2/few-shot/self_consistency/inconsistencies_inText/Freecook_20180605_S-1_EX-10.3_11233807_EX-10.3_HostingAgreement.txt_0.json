Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The text contains conflicting statements regarding the project timeline. It states that the company will use its best efforts to deliver within the 12-week timeframe specified in the Scope of Work. However, it also guarantees completion within 8 weeks and mentions penalties for delays beyond this timeframe. This creates ambiguity as to the actual guaranteed completion timeline and whether penalties apply for delays between 8 and 12 weeks.",

Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 according to the following milestone schedule: $1,000 upon completion of Stage 1 of the Scope of Work, $1,000 upon completion of Stage 2, and $1,100 upon completion of Stage 3.",
        "explanation": "The initial sentence states that the client agrees to pay a total of $5,000 upon signing, which implies that the entire payment is due upfront. The subsequent sentences contradict this by providing a payment schedule with a prepayment of $1,900 and the remaining $3,100 to be paid in installments upon completion of different stages of the project. This creates confusion regarding the payment terms and whether the full amount is due at signing or according to the milestone schedule.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "The surcharge is presented as 'either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.' It should be clarified whether standard hourly rate is in fact $40, because if so, $40 plus 25% will always be lower than $100. This makes $100 redundant.",

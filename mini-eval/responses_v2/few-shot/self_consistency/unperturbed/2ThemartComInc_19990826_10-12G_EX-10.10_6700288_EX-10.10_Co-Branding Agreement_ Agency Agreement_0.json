        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding renewal. It states that renewal requires mutual written agreement, but then also states the agreement will automatically renew if notice isn't given. This creates uncertainty about the actual renewal process and whether explicit agreement is truly required.",

Each party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify the other party (the \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party\" introduces ambiguity and limits the scope of indemnity. It's unclear under what circumstances the Indemnified Party would be considered a principal, making the extent of indemnity uncertain and potentially unenforceable.",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
        "explanation": "This establishes that California Escrow Law will prevail, but then states the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict. This creates ambiguity as to what happens when law and agreement conflict. It doesn't provide clear direction which creates a loophole.",

Siemens shall give Accuray written notice of any change to its Code of Conduct as soon as  reasonably practicable.\n     12.7.3.

        "explanation": "Section 12.7.2 states that Accuray must comply with Siemens' Code of Conduct. Section 12.7.3 states that Distributor must comply with Siemens' Business Conduct Guidelines and other internal regulations. However, 'Distributor' is defined in Section 1.3 as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights by Siemens, so the same entity cannot be Accuray and Distributor which makes this contradictory.",

        "section": "4.8. Service Agreements. Accuray will provide its then current Service Agreements to Distributor from time to time during the Term of this  Agreement and any extension thereof, or upon request from Distributor. All prices will be stated in US Dollars, unless another  currency is agreed upon in writing by Accuray. Such Service Agreements are to be offered to the Customer on the terms as set forth  in those agreements, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of Accuray. Accuray shall execute a  Service Agreement with the Customer upon receipt of (i) a copy of such Service Agreement executed by the Customer, and (ii) any  payments then due under such Service Agreement; provided, however, that Accuray shall have no obligation to enter into such  Service Agreement if it materially deviates from the form Service Agreement provided to Distributor; provided, further, that if  Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of Systems specifically for the  country in which the Customer requests Services, as a condition to any sale of Services to such Customer, Accuray may require  Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the  Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor may (at its sole discretion) enter into such Service  Agreement with such Customer and will provide directly to such Customer the Services required to be performed under such Service  Agreement. If Accuray enters into such Service Agreement with such Customer, Accuray will be responsible for and will provide to  such Customer (either directly or through one or more of its distributors) the services required to be performed under such Service  Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The section states that if Accuray doesn't have a presence in the Customer's country, it 'may require Distributor...to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement.' However, Distributor is already defined as Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights by Siemens. It is contradictory to require the distributor to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray, when the distributor is already defined.",

In case of any contradiction between this Agreement and the  Strategic Alliance Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.",
        "explanation": "This clause tries to establish the hierarchy between this agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement, stating that this agreement prevails in case of conflict. However, several clauses in this agreement (e.g., 3.12, 4.8, 12.6) explicitly reference and incorporate specific sections of the Strategic Alliance Agreement. This creates a contradiction because while 12.17 asserts the dominance of this agreement, other provisions rely on the Strategic Alliance Agreement, potentially leading to uncertainty when those specific referenced sections conflict.",

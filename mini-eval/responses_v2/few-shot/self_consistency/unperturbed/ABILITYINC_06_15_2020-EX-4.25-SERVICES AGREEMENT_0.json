        "section": "Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency between the requirement that Provider Representatives be dedicated solely to Recipient and the allowance for subcontractors. If subcontractors are used, it's unclear whether those individuals must also be exclusively dedicated to Recipient, creating uncertainty about the scope of dedication.",

        "explanation": "This contradicts section 2.2, if there are third parties involved. Subcontractors can be involved in providing the services to Recipient, and yet, this section focuses solely on 'any employees of Provider'.",

In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, 'Out-of-Pocket Costs'), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "This defines that Recipient will pay Provider's actual cost + 10% service fee. This is misaligned, as there is no specific definition of 'actual cost', leading to potential abuse of expenses.",

During the term of this Agreement and thereafter, the Parties hereto shall, and shall instruct their respective representatives to, maintain in confidence and not disclose the other Party's financial, technical, sales, marketing, development, personnel, and other information, records, or data, including, without limitation, customer lists, supplier lists, trade secrets, designs, product formulations, product specifications or any other proprietary or confidential information, however recorded or preserved, whether written or oral (any such information, 'Confidential Information'). Each Party hereto shall use the same degree of care, but no less than reasonable care, to protect the other Party's Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like nature. Unless otherwise authorized in any other agreement between the Parties, any Party receiving any Confidential Information of the other Party (the 'Receiving Party') may use Confidential Information only for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement (the 'Permitted Purpose'). Any Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information only to its representatives who have a need to know such information for the Permitted Purpose and who have been advised of the terms of this Section 4.1 and the Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach of these confidentiality provisions by such Persons; provided, however, that any Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by law, in which case the Receiving Party shall promptly notify, to the extent possible, the disclosing party (the 'Disclosing Party'), and take reasonable steps to assist in contesting such disclosure requirement or in protecting the Disclosing Party's rights prior to disclosure, and in which case the Receiving Party shall only disclose such Confidential Information that it is advised by its counsel in writing that it is legally bound to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 'Confidential Information' shall not include any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) was publicly known at the time of disclosure to it, or has become publicly known through no act of the Receiving Party or its representatives in breach of this Section 4.1, (b) was rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality, or (c) was developed by it independently without any reliance on the Confidential Information.",

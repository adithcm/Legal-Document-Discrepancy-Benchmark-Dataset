(a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines how the client agrees to pay the company for design work that will be done. Any changes need to be submitted in writing. The definition of 'additional work' is not laid out well, since there are too many possible senarios that could be considered additional work. All senarios should be included in the agreement.",

Company will assume that all the written content submitted by Client has been proofread and is ready for publication. Client may elect to pay Company to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above.",
        "explanation": "There is contradictory language in this section as it states the company will make no attempt to proof read the context, but the client may elect to pay company to type and proofread. It is contradictory because it says company will not do it, but client can pay the company to do it.",

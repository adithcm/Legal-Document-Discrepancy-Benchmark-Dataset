        "explanation": "The initial statement indicates payment is tied to the Scope of Work outlined in Exhibit A. However, subsection (a) allows for 'Change Orders' for 'Additional Work,' effectively modifying the original Scope of Work. This creates ambiguity: Does the initial payment cover only the original Scope of Work, or also any additions/revisions accepted via Change Orders? It's not explicitly stated if Change Orders incur additional fees *beyond* the initial $5,000, potentially leading to payment disputes.",

Any email or telephone correspondence received after normal business hours will be processed the following business day. Client shall pay an additional surcharge for any services requiring work to be performed outside of normal business hours by reason of a rush deadline requested by Client or as a result of Client's failure to meet scheduled times for delivery and/or review and approval of information, content and materials. The surcharge for rush work shall be the hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%).",
        "explanation": "While it outlines the conditions for rush work and a surcharge, the agreement omits defining the standard 'hourly rate.' This lack of clarity introduces significant ambiguity regarding the actual cost of rush services. The client cannot reasonably estimate or agree to the cost of rush work without knowing the base hourly rate.",

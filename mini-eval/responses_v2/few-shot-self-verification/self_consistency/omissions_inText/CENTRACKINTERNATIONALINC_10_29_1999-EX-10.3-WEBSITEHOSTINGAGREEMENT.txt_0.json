        "explanation": "The phrase 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance' lacks specific definition. What constitutes 'reasonable' is subjective and could lead to disputes. This ambiguity could be resolved by specifying the maximum downtime allowed for maintenance or providing a process for pre-approval of maintenance schedules.",

Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The Sponsor is responsible for 'oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust' while simultaneously not responsible for 'the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice.' This is an ambiguity because 'management services' could be interpreted to include managing assets or providing investment advice.",

Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The allocation of expenses dictates that Domini pays salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who dedicate time to Domini or its affiliates. However, the Trust is responsible for compensating Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor. It's unclear if Trustees affiliated with Domini but acting in their capacity as Trustees of the Trust should be paid by Domini or by the Trust.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'mutually agreed upon fee' is vague. There's no mention of how the fee is initially determined or what happens if mutual agreement cannot be reached. Furthermore, the language is ambiguous because the initial fee can be determined by a mututal agreement but when Domini serves as the Sponsor for less time, a mututal agreement is used again but it is a different type of mututal agreement.",

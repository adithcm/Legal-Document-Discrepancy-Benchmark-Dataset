Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section states that the Sponsor performs services 'as requested by the Trust', implying the Trust directs the Sponsor's duties. The subsequent sentence, 'These services include but are not limited to...', imposes specific duties on the Sponsor that aren't necessarily dependent on the Trust's request, creating a contradiction as to who is ultimately in control of defining those specific duties.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "The initial statement requires a 'mutually agreed upon fee,' suggesting a formal agreement on the price. The later part says, 'If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.' This implies that only in certain situation, will there be a 'mutually agreed upon fee.'",

Without any further stipulations, this clause means that Domini can subcontract to anyone they desire, no matter how unqualified they may be.

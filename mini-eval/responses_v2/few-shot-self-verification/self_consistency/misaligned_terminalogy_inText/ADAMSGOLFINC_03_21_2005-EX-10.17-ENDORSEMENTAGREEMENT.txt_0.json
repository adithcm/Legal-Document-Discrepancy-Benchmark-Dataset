        "explanation": "This definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is highly restrictive. The WITNESSETH clause states ADAMS GOLF desires to use the Consultant's endorsement in connection with advertisement and promotion. Limiting the definition to internal documentation directly contradicts the stated purpose of the agreement, making it structurally flawed.",

This implies that there are more products than just metal woods and drivers",

However, the exception allows for behavior that brings media attention to the product, even if such behavior might violate public morals.

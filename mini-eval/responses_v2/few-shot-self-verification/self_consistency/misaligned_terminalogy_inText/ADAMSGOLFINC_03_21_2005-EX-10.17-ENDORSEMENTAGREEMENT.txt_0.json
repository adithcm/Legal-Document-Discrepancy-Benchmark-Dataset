        "explanation": "The contract specifies a term length with redacted portions, creating ambiguity. The number of years and months are not specified. The termination date is also completely redacted. This lack of clarity makes it impossible to determine the actual duration of the agreement and enforce its terms related to time-sensitive obligations. This is an omission of key contractual information.",

        "explanation": "This definition is overly restrictive. The contract grants ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right to use the consultant's endorsement for advertising and promotion of the product (section 3). However, the definition of endorsement limits its use to ADAMS GOLF'S internal documentation, thus contradicting the grant of rights in Section 3. This creates a misalignment as the contract grants a right, but then defines that right so narrowly that it becomes practically useless for the intended purpose.",

(It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "The redacted portion [* ****] implies an exception to the exclusive use of ADAMS GOLF clubs. The omission of the type and the number of clubs weakens the exclusivity clause and creates ambiguity regarding the extent of the consultant's freedom to use non-ADAMS GOLF clubs. It is unclear what clubs fall into the redacted portion. Thus, this ambiguity could lead to disputes over what constitutes a violation of the exclusive use requirement.",

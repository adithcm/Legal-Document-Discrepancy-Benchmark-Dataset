        "explanation": "The agreement states that \"The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450.\" and then later states \"The subscriber is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999.\" This is an inconsistency in terminology as the contract uses the terms 'Customer' and 'subscriber' interchangeably without defining them. This can lead to confusion about who is obligated to make the payments if these terms are interpreted differently.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.",
        "explanation": "The contract initially states that the agreement lasts for six months but is \"automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods\". This creates a clear contradiction because the term is defined as both fixed (6 months) and automatically renewing (monthly), leading to ambiguity about the true duration of the agreement. It's unclear whether the initial six-month term is superseded by the automatic renewal clause, or how these two provisions interact.",

        "explanation": "The statement that i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays is a legal statement that is vague. \"reasonable hardware and software maintenance\" is not defined and can lead to multiple interpretations as the term does not explain what i-on can do.

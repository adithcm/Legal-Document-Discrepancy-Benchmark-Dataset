        "explanation": "This creates an internal contradiction. The document establishes a joint venture, but then states that the 'partnership name' will be Vaccines2Go. This implies that Vaccines2Go is operating as a sole entity. It's unclear if BM&V2GO or Vaccines2Go is the legal entity of the joint venture, leading to potential legal ambiguity.",

Where joint ventures are not recognized by statute as separate legal entities, Venture property, including intellectual property, will be held in the name of one or more Members. In all cases Venture property will be applied by the Members exclusively for the benefit and purposes of the Venture and in accordance with this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This clause has structural flaws. First, it describes what happens when statues allow all property to stay in the name of the venture. The subsequent sentence describes what happens when joint ventures are not recognized. It is unclear which State statues are being referenced, thus making the clause confusing to understand.",

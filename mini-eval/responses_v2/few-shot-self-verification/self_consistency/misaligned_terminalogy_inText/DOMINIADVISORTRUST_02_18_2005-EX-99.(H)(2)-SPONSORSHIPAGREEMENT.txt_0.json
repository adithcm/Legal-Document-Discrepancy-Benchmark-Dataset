        "section": "WHEREAS, the Trust wishes to engage Domini to provide certain oversight, administrative and management services, and Domini is willing to provide such oversight, administrative and management services to the Trust on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;",
        "explanation": "While the recitals state Domini provides \"oversight, administrative, and management services\", Section 1(j) only lists \"arranging for and preparing annual renewals for fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance coverage\". This is an omission, since the WHEREAS indicates the Sponsor should be providing services related to the investment itself, but the detailed duties of the sponsor do not describe this oversight, creating an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This paragraph contradicts the overall nature of the agreement, which describes the Sponsor as providing oversight, administrative and management services, and lists several specific duties.  The phrase \"the Sponsor shall NOT be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series\" nullifies the original intentions of the Sponsor as the one providing management services. This is an in-text contradiction.",

As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
        "explanation": "This creates an inconsistency by broadly exempting the Sponsor from liability, except in cases of \"willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence\".  However, the Sponsor has a fiduciary duty to act with reasonable care and skill. This would be an Omission of legal terms. ",

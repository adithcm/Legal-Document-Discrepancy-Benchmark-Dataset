        "section": "Notwithstanding the contents of the Exhibit, Provider agrees to respond in good faith to any reasonable request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, at a price to be agreed upon after good faith negotiations between the Parties. Any such additional services and resources so provided by Provider shall constitute Services under this Agreement and be subject in all respect to the provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on the Exhibit as of the date hereof.",
        "explanation": "The term says that any requests by Recipient has to be at a price to be agreed upon after good faith negotiations between the Parties'. The parties should be able to work together, but since negotiations may not turn out favorable, it is ambiguous that the term has that definition.",

        "explanation": "This change introduces a potential in-text contradiction. While Provider Representatives must be dedicated solely to Recipient, Section 1.3 allows Recipient to acquire similar services from other providers. This creates a conflict if those 'other providers' are the same individuals who are supposed to be solely dedicated to Recipient, thus raising legal and ethical questions.",

In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the calculation of 'actual cost'. It's unclear if the 10% service fee is applied *before* or *after* the reimbursement of Out-of-Pocket Costs. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes over the total amount owed, because depending on the order of calculation, the final amount will be different.",

(\"PVSS\"), (the \"Parties\" or \"Joint Venturers\" if referred to collectively, or the \"Party\" or Joint Venturer\" if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\"), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that the Parties associate themselves as 'business associates, and not as partners', but then later refers to them as 'Joint Venturers'. While a joint venture is a type of business association, the contract does not define what is meant by 'business associates', but goes on to use the word partner, which is contradictory.",

The Joint Venturers recognize that both of the Joint Venturers are and will continue to be engaged in the conduct of their respective businesses for their own account. Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",
        "explanation": "It states that 'Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses'. Direct expenses can be considerd compensation as the Joint Venturer's do not have to pay for their own expenses.",

Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation. The Parties also declare that they are not making any agreement to undertake any business other than that set forth in this Agreement; and nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation of the powers or rights of either Party to carry on his separate business for his sole benefit; provided, however, the Parties shall cooperate with each other according to the terms and spirit of this Agreement in the performance of their joint venture business operation.",
        "explanation": "The section about the Internal Revenue Code Election contains structural flaws. The language is convoluted and contains multiple embedded clauses, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning without significant effort. The average person would struggle to understand the full legal implications of this section.",

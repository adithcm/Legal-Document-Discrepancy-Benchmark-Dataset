        "explanation": "The initial description of the distributor's role is contradicted by the later specification that the distributor is non-exclusive. A \"worldwide distributor\" typically implies exclusivity, but the \"non-exclusive\" term limits the scope of the distributor's rights. There is no description of what is meant by 'non-exclusive', which means that there could be multiple distributors, leading to the distributor losing its meaning.",

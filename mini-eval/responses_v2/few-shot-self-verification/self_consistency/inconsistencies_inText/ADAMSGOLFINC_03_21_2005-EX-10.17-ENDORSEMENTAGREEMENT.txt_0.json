        "section": "MINIMUM NUMBER OF TOURNAMENTS AND POTENTIAL REPAYMENT OF BASE COMPENSATION A. In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows: The agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year: 1. Year 1. $[*****] 2. Year 2 $[*****] 3. Year 3 $[*****] 4. Year 4 $[*****] 5. Year 5 $[*****] B.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within three months following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than March 31, 2006. C.In the event that CONSULTANT is prevented from competing for reasons outside his control, the parties agree to a good faith attempt to resolve the issues. If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "Section 8 outlines a repayment scheme if the consultant fails to meet a minimum number of tournament appearances. However, it also states that if the consultant is prevented from competing due to reasons outside of their control, a 'good faith attempt' will be made to resolve the issues, but a resolution is not guaranteed. If no resolution can be reached, Adams Golf, at its sole discretion, may demand a prorated repayment. This creates a contradiction, because if the consultant does not participate because they are sick, it is up to Adams Golf to decide whether to ask for repayment.",

        "explanation": "Section 18 outlines a base compensation that will be paid to the consultant throughout the agreement term. It says that the base compensation shall be paid upon completion of each calendar year of the contract. However, Section 8A, Section 22, and Section 23 all mention repayment schedules if certain conditions are not met. This is a contradiction, because the agreement does not clearly say how to determine whether the contract year is complete. If it's not complete, can the repayment schemes in Section 8A, Section 22, and Section 23 come into play? This causes ambiguity, and could lead to potential disputes.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Section 23 says that if there is a material breach of this agreement, the other party may terminate for cause. The breaching party must be given 15 days written notice, and have 30 days to fix the issue. However, if the material breach is not rectified within the 30 day period, the other party can terminate the agreement. Upon termination, the consultant shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF. The contradiction is the written notice in the text, which is 'fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such thirty (30) day period'. Which is it, 15 days, or 30 days?",

        "explanation": "This section states that Domini will cover legal counsel fees. However, it's not specified for whom the legal counsel is, the Trust, or Domini. This lack of clarity leads to misinterpretation. It also says the fees due to the sponsor under this agreement is an exception, yet in point 3 it details how they are to be compensated.",

        "explanation": "The contradictory part lies in allowing termination 'at any time' but then requiring 'not less than 60 days' written notice.' This creates ambiguity. Is the termination effective immediately upon payment of the penalty, or only after the 60-day notice period?",

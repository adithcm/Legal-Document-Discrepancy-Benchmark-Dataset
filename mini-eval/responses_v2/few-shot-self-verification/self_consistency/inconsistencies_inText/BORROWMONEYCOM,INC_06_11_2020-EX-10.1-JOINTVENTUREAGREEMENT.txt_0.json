        "explanation": "This section indicates that JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go is paying $60,000.00 in cash, plus 10% of generated revenue. However, the total contributions is valued at $3,500,000. This is a structural flaw because it does not add up. Also, JVLS, LLC has already committed to paying 10% of gross revenue in Section 13. Adding the phrase 'Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue, In Addition to The Total Contributions' is repetitive and could lead to interpretational issues.",

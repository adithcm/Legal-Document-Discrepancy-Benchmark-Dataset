        "explanation": "The first sentence guarantees continuous operation except for 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance'. The second sentence then states i-on will perform such maintenance 'during any time of the day, including weekdays'. This creates a contradiction, as maintenance at 'any time' could disrupt the 'continuous' operation promised in the first sentence, creating uncertainty for the customer.",

The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The second sentence says that the recurring monthly fee must be paid by the 20th day of each month beginning April 1, 1999. However, in the third sentence, it says that failure to pay the fees in a timely manner will result in the interuption or discontination of services for the Hosted Site. This introduces contradictory statements and ambiguity. It is not explained how the interuption or discontination of services happens, which makes the reader assume it is done immidiately. Thus the statements are contradictory and create ambiguity as to the conditions of paying the monthly fee.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding termination. The first sentence provides an automatic renewal for one month, which requires a 5 day notice to prevent renewal. The second sentence allows termination 'at any time' with 30 days notice. The ambiguity arises from the term 'at any time' with 30 days notice, because it's not stated if it means during the renewal period or not. ",

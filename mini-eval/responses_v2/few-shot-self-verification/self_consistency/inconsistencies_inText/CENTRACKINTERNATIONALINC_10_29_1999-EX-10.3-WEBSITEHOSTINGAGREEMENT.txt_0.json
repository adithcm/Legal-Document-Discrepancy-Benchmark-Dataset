        "explanation": "This section states continuous operation except for reasonable maintenance, but then allows i-on to perform maintenance at *any* time of day, including weekdays. This effectively negates the 'continuous' promise, as maintenance downtime could occur during peak usage hours, contradicting the expectation of constant availability.",

        "explanation": "The contract's term is initially defined as six months. However, it includes an automatic renewal clause for one-month periods unless a five-day notice is given. This creates confusion. It is unclear whether the contract renews every one month after the intial 6 months or whether it renews for one month after each initial month.",

Having the first payment due on April 1st creates a misaglignment with when services were actually provided.",

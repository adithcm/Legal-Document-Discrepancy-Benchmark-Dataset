        "explanation": "There is a contradiction regarding the project completion timeframe. The text initially states a 12-week timeframe (February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018), but then immediately states that the Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks. This creates ambiguity about the actual project timeline and when penalties for delays apply.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "The way the hourly rate is calculated is ambiguious. It uses the language: 'The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.' It is not clear if the standard hourly rate is 40 dollars per hour or the flat fee is 100 dollars per hour. What is the true calculation? There are 2 variables for one calculation.",

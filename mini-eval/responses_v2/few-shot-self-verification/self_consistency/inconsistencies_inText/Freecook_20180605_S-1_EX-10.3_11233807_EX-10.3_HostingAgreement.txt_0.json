        "section": "Company will use its best efforts to deliver the Client Website in the time frame specified in the Scope of Work. Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a textual inconsistency regarding the project timeline. It initially states that the company will use its best efforts to deliver within the 12-week timeframe outlined in the Scope of Work (February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018). However, it then guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays. The discrepancy lies in the conflict between the 'best efforts' clause for the 12-week timeframe and the guaranteed completion within 8 weeks. It's unclear whether the company is bound by the 8-week guarantee or if the 12-week timeframe is the primary objective.",

Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 according to the following milestone schedule: $1,000 upon completion of Stage 1 of the Scope of Work, $1,000 upon completion of Stage 2, and $1,100 upon completion of Stage 3.",
        "explanation": "The text includes a structural flaw, where the details are not properly structured. The text refers to the total amount as $5,000 in the first sentence. While the second sentence states that the client must pay a prepayment of $1,900 and the remaining $3,100 to the company. It can be confusing since the details are being presented at the same time as the total amount to be paid.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "This section includes a textual ambiguity and possible inconsistency regarding the surcharge calculation for rush work. It states that the surcharge will be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower. A calculation of 25% ontop of the $40 rate will be $50. Therefore, there is a contradiction, as the 'whichever is lower' should be 'whichever is higher', to make sense in this context.",

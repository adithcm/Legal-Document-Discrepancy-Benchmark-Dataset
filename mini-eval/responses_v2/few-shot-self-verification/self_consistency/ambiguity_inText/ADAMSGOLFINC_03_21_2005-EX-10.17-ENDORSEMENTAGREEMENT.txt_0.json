        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. This excludes use of likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Endorsement' is too narrowly defined. As it states that Adams Golf can only use the consultant's name, but the first WHEREAS statement provides that Adams Golf wants to use the consultant's name, likeness and endorsement. There is ambiguity regarding whether the likeness of the consultant is part of the definition of the endorsement. This is an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This statement introduces a contradiction by stating that the consultant must exclusively use the mandatory product, but then it is stated that the consultant can use equipment from any manufacture without restriction. This can be interpreted to the point that the consultant does not need to use Adams Golf products at any time, as there are no restrictions.",

ADAMS GOLF shall reimburse CONSULTANT for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances. Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation.",
        "explanation": "There is a structural flaw, as there is a disjointed text. Travel expenses include jet fuel, which is contradictory to what constitutes as travel expenses in the real-world, which is normally just air-fare. Jet fuel is only used when someone uses a personal jet.",

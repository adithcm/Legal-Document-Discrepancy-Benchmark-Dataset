        "section": "The duration of this Venture (the \"Term\") will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025, unless terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the Managers.",
        "explanation": "The term states that the venture will continue until February 28, 2025, but later mentions that the agreement can be terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the Managers. This creates a contradiction between a fixed term and an early termination option, making the actual duration uncertain.",

        "explanation": "The initial statement mentions that changes can be made via decision of the managers, however in the very next sentence, it states that it will require unanimous consent. This introduces contradicting requirements for amending capital contributions. This conflict creates uncertainty about the process.",

Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction. While it guarantees a 12-week delivery timeframe and states that due dates are not subject to delay, Section 1(a) allows for changes to the Scope of Work via Change Orders. If a Change Order is approved, it would necessarily impact the due dates, contradicting the 'no delay' clause. The 'no delay' clause would make any Change Order practically impossible.",

Any content submitted by Client in any other manner or format, including, but not limited to Adobe PDF format, will be returned to Client for resubmission. Company will not make any attempt to proof read or correct any contextual, grammatical or typographical errors in the written content submitted by Client. It is Client's sole responsibility to check the accuracy of the written content and correct any errors prior to submission for final publication. Company will assume that all the written content submitted by Client has been proofread and is ready for publication. Client may elect to pay Company the Hourly Rate set forth below to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the electronic formats specified above.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states that the client is responsible for proofreading the submitted content and any content that is not submitted by the client in the correct format will be returned to the client for revision. However, the agreement then states that the client can elect to pay the company the hourly rate to type and proofread any written content not submitted in the specified formats. The discrepancy is that the first section states that the client must resubmit the content in the correct format, however, the client can elect to pay for the company to do so instead. This is an inconsistently defined term within the document itself and leads to internal contradictions.",

Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.",
        "explanation": "This section is contradictory. It first states that the Company 'shall provide customer service' and then immediately states that 'Company is not obligated to provide any Customer Service except as specified in this Section', and then continues to allow the company to stop providing it. The initial statement is an obligation, but the following sentences negate this obligation, which creates confusion. This means that customer service is not structred properly and there is a structural flaw within this section.",

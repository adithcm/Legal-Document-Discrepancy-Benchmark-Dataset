        "explanation": "The contract language refers to a 'reasonable sum' as the Contract Price, which is vague. However, Section 2 subsequently specifies the amount as $5,000. This creates an ambiguity, as the initial description implies the price could be subject to interpretation.",

        "explanation": "The initial text guarantees delivery within the timeframe specified in the Scope of Work and states that due dates are not subject to delay. However, the subsequent removal of 'unless otherwise agreed by Client and Company' creates a contradiction. Without this condition, the company is accountable for meeting all deadlines regardless of if the client needs to extend, meaning the client is not able to change any deadlines.",

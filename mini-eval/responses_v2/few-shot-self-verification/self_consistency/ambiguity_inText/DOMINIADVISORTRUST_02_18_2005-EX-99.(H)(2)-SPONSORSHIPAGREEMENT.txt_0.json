        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This clause contradicts standard legal principles regarding liability. It holds the Sponsor liable even in the absence of negligence or bad faith, which is highly unusual. Normally, liability requires some degree of fault. Holding the Sponsor liable for a simple 'error of judgment or mistake of law' without any culpability is an extremely broad and potentially unenforceable standard, creating a legal contradiction. It is unlikely a court would enforce this provision as written.",

        "section": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, with the payment of a penalty equal to one year of the average management fees collected over the prior three years, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.",
        "explanation": "The term penalty is ambiguous as termination fees should not be referred to as penalties. A penalty usually implies a punishment for wrongdoing or breach of contract. Here, it functions as a fee for ending the agreement, creating a misalignment in the way this is stated.",

        "explanation": "This clause creates a contradiction regarding the Sponsor's responsibility. First, it states that Domini may subcontract obligations without needing approval from the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations. Secondly, the subcontracting liability is lessened with only gross negligence being a cause of action. This limits the Trust's ability to hold the Sponsor accountable for substandard performance by subcontractors, creating a legal contradiction in the intended protection for the Trust.",

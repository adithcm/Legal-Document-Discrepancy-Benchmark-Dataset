        "explanation": "The section states that the Sponsor is liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of law *even without* willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. This sets an extremely high standard of care, potentially exceeding what is legally required or reasonable. This would contradict general legal principles requiring some level of culpability (negligence, intent) for liability to attach.",

        "explanation": "This clause allows Domini to subcontract obligations without requiring approval from the Trustees regarding the subcontractor's qualifications. This is a contradiction because the Trustee should be ensuring that the subcontractor meets the required standards.",

        "explanation": "This section sets a penalty for early termination and may be subject to legal scrutiny as an unreasonable penalty. Contract law generally disfavors penalties that are disproportionate to the actual damages suffered. If the penalty significantly exceeds the Trust's actual damages, it could be deemed unenforceable.",

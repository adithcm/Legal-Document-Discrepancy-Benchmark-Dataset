        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that the Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error, even without negligence. This is extremely broad and contradicts general legal principles where liability typically requires some level of fault (negligence, recklessness, or intentional misconduct). This is unusual and creates a high standard of care that may be unenforceable.",

        "explanation": "This clause creates a contradiction by first stating that Domini may subcontract obligations without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust and second, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence. Thus, it is in text contradiction because it sets a condition of needing approval and a standard of not being held liable.",

        "explanation": "Requiring a penalty for termination introduces a structural flaw in the provision. Termination clauses are typically structured with notice periods or specific conditions, not financial penalties, especially without defining a cause for termination. The inclusion of a penalty makes the agreement resemble a debt obligation rather than a service contract, creating a legal complexity.",

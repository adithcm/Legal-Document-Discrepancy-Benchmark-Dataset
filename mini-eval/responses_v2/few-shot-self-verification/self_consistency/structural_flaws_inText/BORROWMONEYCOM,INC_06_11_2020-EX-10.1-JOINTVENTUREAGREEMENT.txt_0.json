        "explanation": "The exclusive purpose includes 'IT Development, internet Back office Maintenance And Deployment of medical Service'. By allowing BorrowMoney.com, inc. to change the purpose at its discretion, it undermines the mutuality of the venture. The other member, JVLS, LLC, entered the agreement based on the initial purpose, which could be changed without their consent, potentially making the venture no longer beneficial or even detrimental to them.",

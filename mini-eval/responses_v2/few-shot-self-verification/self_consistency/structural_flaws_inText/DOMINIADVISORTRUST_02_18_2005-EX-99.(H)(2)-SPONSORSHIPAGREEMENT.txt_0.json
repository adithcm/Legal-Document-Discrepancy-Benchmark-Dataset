Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction regarding Domini's liability for subcontractors. By stating \"Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage\", it contradicts that Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services since it would imply they are not covered by Domini's insurance.",

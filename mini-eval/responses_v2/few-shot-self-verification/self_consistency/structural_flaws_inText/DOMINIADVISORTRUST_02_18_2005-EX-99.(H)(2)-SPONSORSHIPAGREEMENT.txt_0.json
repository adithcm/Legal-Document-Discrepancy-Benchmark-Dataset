However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The text includes contradictory stipulations concerning penalties upon termination. Initially, it states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty.' This is immediately followed by 'termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.'",

Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This introduces ambiguity and creates a potential contradiction. It states Domini's responsibility is limited to the subcontractor's insurance coverage, yet also says Domini is not responsible for acts outside the scope of contracted services. If a subcontractor commits a negligent act within the contracted services but their insurance doesn't fully cover it, it is unclear if Domini has any remaining liability. This can confuse the scope of liability.",

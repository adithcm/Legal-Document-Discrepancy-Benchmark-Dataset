        "explanation": "The customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450, but the customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees at their discretion and convenience. This is a contradiction because the customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fee, but they can pay it at their discretion and convenience. There needs to be clarity if it is on a specific date or can it be on any random date.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon fifteen (15) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The contract term commences on April 1, 1999 for six months, but it is contradicted by the agreement automatically being renewed for one or more one month periods unless either the Customer or I-on gives notice. This can be seen as contradictory because the first part indicates the contract is for a fixed term of six months, the second part provides an automatic renewal after the initial six months, if either parties doesn't provide a 15 days notice. The third part of the agreement states that either party can terminate the agreement without cause at any time. This contradicts the fixed six-month term",

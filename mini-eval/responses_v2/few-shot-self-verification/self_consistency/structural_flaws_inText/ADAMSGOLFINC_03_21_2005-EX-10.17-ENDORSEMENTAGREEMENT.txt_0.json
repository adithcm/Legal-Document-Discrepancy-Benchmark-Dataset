This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is overly restrictive. By limiting the endorsement to only the consultant's name and excluding other identifying characteristics, the contract severely limits Adams Golf's ability to effectively market its products using the consultant's endorsement. This narrow definition might render the endorsement practically useless.",

He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "Section 5 gives the consultant complete discretion over the clubs he uses. There is a contradiction as it states he is encouraged to use the mandatory product when feasible. However the consultant can also play clubs other than ADAMS GOLF and endorse the clubs. This creates a contradiction as to what the consultant has to adhere to.",

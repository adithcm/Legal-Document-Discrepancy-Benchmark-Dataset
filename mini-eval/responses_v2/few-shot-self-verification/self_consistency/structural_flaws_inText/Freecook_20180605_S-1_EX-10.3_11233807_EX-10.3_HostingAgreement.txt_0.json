        "explanation": "This section states that due dates are guaranteed 'regardless of whether the company receives required materials, documentation, or approvals in a timely fashion from the client'. This is an unrealistic and contradictory statement, as the company's ability to meet deadlines is directly dependent on the client's provision of necessary inputs. It is a contradiction to say deadlines are guaranteed even if the company doesn't receive what it needs from the client.",

        "explanation": "This section initially states the remaining payment is due 'on completion of the Scope of Work', but then immediately contradicts this by saying 'However, the Client can pay the remaining amount at any time, or in multiple installments, before the Scope of Work completion.' This creates an ambiguity as to when the final payment is actually due, at the end of the project, or at any point before the project completion.",

        "explanation": "This section presents a direct contradiction. It first states 'Company is obligated to continue providing Customer Service throughout the duration of this agreement, and may not alter or cease providing Customer Service'. It then immediately states 'Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.' This creates uncertainty about the level of Customer Service. The text is unclear.",

        "section": "8.1 TERM.  The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  <*$p$*>In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. The first part of the section states that renewal requires mutual written agreement. The last sentence says that it will be automatically renewed if either party doesn't give notice of non-renewal. These statements contradict each other. One implies active consent, the other implies passive consent.",

        "explanation": "Section 2.4 [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS] does not provide for termination of the agreement. Section 2.3 [LAUNCH TIMING] has a termination clause.

        "explanation": "The first part of this section outlines general indemnity, stating that each party will indemnify the other for claims arising from their own acts or omissions, to the extent that the Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying Party. This introduces a condition that limits the scope of the indemnity to situations where the Indemnified Party is considered a principal of the Indemnifying Party. The subsequent sentences expand on this, with 2TheMart indemnifying i-Escrow for claims arising from 2TheMart Content and i-Escrow indemnifying 2TheMart for claims arising from i-Escrow Content and the Services. The indemnity provided to each party should be clear. This creates ambiguity.",

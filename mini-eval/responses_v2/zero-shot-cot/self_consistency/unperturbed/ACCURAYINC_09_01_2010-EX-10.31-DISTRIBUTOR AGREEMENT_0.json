        "section": "2.2.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Distributor may present for approval  to Accuray opportunities for sales of Products and Services at prices that differ from the prices set forth in the then current  price list. Accuray may, in its sole and absolute discretion, approve any such opportunity, and if approved in writing by  Accuray, Distributor shall otherwise be permitted to pursue such opportunity at such prices, which opportunity shall  otherwise be governed by and pursued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"sole and absolute discretion\" provides Accuray with unlimited power to approve or disapprove opportunities presented by the Distributor without any stated criteria or limitations. This lack of constraint could be interpreted as a structural flaw because it doesn't provide a framework for fair and reasonable decision-making.",

        "section": "2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order,  which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either  accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of  such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall  be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized  representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the  terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be  bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.  The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address:\n\nAccuray Incorporated\nATTN: Contracts Administration\n1310 Chesapeake Terrace\nSunnyvale, CA 94089\nMain: (408) 716-4600\nFax: (408) 789-4205\nEmail: Orders@accuray.com",
        "explanation": "The section states that Accuray's failure to approve or disapprove a Purchase Order within two weeks constitutes disapproval. However, it also states that \"Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray.\" This creates an inconsistency because the first sentence implies that silence equals rejection, while the second implies that explicit execution is required for acceptance. What happens if Accuray does not execute the PO within the two week period, but also does not explicitly reject the PO?",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor  shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor  may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's  reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray  shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra  insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the  need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray,  if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if  a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses  required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was  October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The last sentence of this section provides two examples of how expedited delivery expenses should be borne based on different requested delivery dates. The phrase \"if the requested delivery date was October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor\" does not make logical sense. The section begins by stating that Accuray bears the cost of expenses if the delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor, therefore any delivery before 6 months of submission would be borne by the distributor. This is a structural flaw in the text.",

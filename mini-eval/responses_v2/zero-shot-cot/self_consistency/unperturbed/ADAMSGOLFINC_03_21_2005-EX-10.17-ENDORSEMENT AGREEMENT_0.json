Without knowing the length of the term or the termination date, it is impossible to determine the obligations and responsibilities of both parties over time. This is an ambiguity in the text because the end date is completely missing which makes the contract vague and open to interpretation, leading to potential disputes.",

        "explanation": "The specific Mandatory Products are redacted. Without knowing which products are mandatory, it's impossible to enforce the clause requiring exclusive use of those products. There is a lack of clarity which leads to potential disagreements about which products the consultant is obligated to use, undermining the purpose of the 'Exclusive Use of Product' clause. The omission of the products that are listed as mandatory leads to a contradiction since it is referenced later on.",

If  [*****] use of CONSULTANT  varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****].

        "explanation": "This section provides an exception to the exclusivity clause, allowing the consultant to endorse a different product. However, the product that the consultant can endorse is redacted, creating an ambiguity. Without knowing the nature of the product being endorsed, it is impossible to determine if there is a conflict of interest with Adams Golf's products or if the endorsement is appropriate. Additionally, the parameters around how the consultant can endorse the product are also redacted, creating further ambiguity and leaving the parties open to interpretation.",

Without knowing the minimum number of events, it is impossible to determine when the repayment clause is triggered.

ADAMS GOLF  shall  reimburse CONSULTANT  for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances.

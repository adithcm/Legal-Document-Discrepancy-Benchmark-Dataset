        "section": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
        "explanation": "This statement creates ambiguity. While it allows for the possibility of capital contributions, it doesn't specify the process for agreeing upon such contributions. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes if one party believes a contribution is necessary and the other disagrees. The absence of a defined mechanism for determining required contributions and the consequences of not making them introduces uncertainty.",

        "section": "It is agreed that either Joint Venturer shall, except as provided for below, have authority to execute instruments of any character relating to the affairs of the Joint Venture; provided, that without the written consent or approval of both of the Joint Venturers: (i) the Joint Venture shall incur no liability of any sort, nor any indebtedness for borrowed funds; (ii) no assets owned in the name of the Joint Venture be disposed of; and (iii) no commitment to purchase any item for the Joint Venture shall be made.",
        "explanation": "This section is structurally flawed and creates ambiguity. The initial statement grants either Joint Venturer authority to execute instruments, but the 'provided that' clause significantly restricts this authority by requiring mutual consent for key actions like incurring liability, disposing of assets, and making purchase commitments. The structure makes it unclear what actions either Joint Venturer *can* take independently, leading to potential disagreements about the scope of their individual authority. The broad initial grant of authority is almost entirely negated by the subsequent restrictions.",

        "explanation": "While the percentages are clearly defined, the section lacks detail on how these income, credits, losses, and deductions are calculated and distributed. It doesn't specify the timing of distributions, the method for valuing assets, or the process for handling disputes related to the allocation of income and expenses. This omission creates potential for disagreements over the financial management of the Joint Venture.",

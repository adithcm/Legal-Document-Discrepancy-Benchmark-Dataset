Delays will not affect the due dates.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an internal contradiction. It states that the due dates in the Scope of Work are guaranteed by the Company, even if the client's delays cause the failure to meet those dates. This is illogical because if the Client doesn't submit the required information on time, the Company can not deliver the work on time, meaning they are not guaranteed. This means that the company is in direct violation of what they promised. It is impossible to guarantee due dates when the Client's actions affect the ability to meet the deadlines.",

        "explanation": "These two sentences contradict each other. The first states that Company is obligated to continue customer service and cannot alter or cease it. The very next sentence states that Company may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service without any liability.

        "explanation": "The text states that the Client is to pay the remaining $3,100 upon completion of the Scope of Work. But then continues to state that the Client can make payments any time before the Scope of Work completion. This is an ambiguity in the text and contradicts the initial payment terms, leaving the actual payment terms unclear. The payment of the $3,100 is ambiguous.",

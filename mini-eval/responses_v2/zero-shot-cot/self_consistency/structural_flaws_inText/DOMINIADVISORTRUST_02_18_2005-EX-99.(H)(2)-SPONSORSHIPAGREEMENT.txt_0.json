        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit Domini's liability for its subcontractors' actions. However, it creates ambiguity and potential contradictions. First, limiting responsibility to the extent of the subcontractor's liability insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential damages to the Trust. Second, stating that Domini is not responsible for acts outside the scope of contracted services could be interpreted in multiple ways. It is not clearly stated who defines the 'scope of contracted services' which means that Domini is creating a legal loophole.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a direct contradiction. It first states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty.' However, it then immediately states that 'termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty.' This contradicts the earlier statement of 'without any penalty.'",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of shares of the Trust\" contains a structural flaw in the text. The repetition of \"shares of shares\" is redundant and doesn't make logical sense. It should likely read \"expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust\" or \"expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares for the Trust\".",

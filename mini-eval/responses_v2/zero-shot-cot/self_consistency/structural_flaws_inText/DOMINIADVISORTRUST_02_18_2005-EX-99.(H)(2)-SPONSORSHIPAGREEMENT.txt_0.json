        "section": "Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a potential contradiction. While it limits Domini's liability to the subcontractor's insurance coverage for actions within the scope of contracted services, it completely absolves Domini of responsibility for acts outside that scope. This could be problematic if Domini negligently selects or oversees the subcontractor, leading to harm. Standard legal principles often hold parties responsible for negligent selection or supervision of subcontractors, regardless of the scope of contracted services. This clause attempts to circumvent that potential liability, creating a conflict with general legal principles.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an inconsistency. The first sentence states the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty'. The second sentence immediately contradicts this by stating that termination by the Sponsor within the first year *will* result in a penalty. This creates ambiguity as to whether a penalty applies in the specified circumstance.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons.",
        "explanation": "While subcontracting is permitted, the agreement fails to clearly define the standard of care Domini must exercise in selecting and overseeing subcontractors. While section 7 touches on liability, it doesn't explicitly state that Domini has a duty to perform due diligence in selecting competent subcontractors or to adequately supervise their work. This omission creates a potential loophole. Domini could argue it has no responsibility for a subcontractor's poor performance or negligence if it was outside the 'scope of contracted services' (as per the limitation of liability clause), even if Domini was negligent in choosing or managing that subcontractor in the first place. This lack of clarity regarding the duty of care creates an ambiguity regarding Domini's overall responsibility.",

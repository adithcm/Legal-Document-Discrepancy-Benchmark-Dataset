        "explanation": "The contract states that i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, 24/7, including holidays. However, it then introduces an exception for necessary hardware and software maintenance, which i-on can perform at its convenience and without prior notice. This creates an ambiguity because the term 'necessary maintenance' is not defined. The lack of definition leads to a contradiction in the agreement, as it is not clear under which circumstances i-on can interrupt services and how long these interruptions may last. This contradicts the initial promise of continuous operation.",

        "section": "Under this Agreement, i-on will provide the following limited services for the Hosted Site: ... 13. up to 1 hour per month of Web site administration services at no additional charge, limited to: requests for changes to ftp/e-mail users and passwords; requests for e-mail configuration changes; modification of mail aliases; changes to server MIME types; files restored from backup; answering questions about server-side scripts; ftp configuration changes; log file configuration changes; importing or exporting of database records; and consultation on site operation and administration. Additional Web site administration services will be billed at $200 per hour.",
        "explanation": "While the clause specifies that additional web site administration services will be billed at $200 per hour, it does not specify how those hours will be billed, for example in 15 minutes increments, 30 minutes increments, or per hour. This creates an in-text contradiction because it leaves room for interpretation and potential disputes about how the additional costs are calculated and applied.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The section includes contradictory statements regarding the agreement's termination. The contract states that the agreement will automatically be renewed for one month unless either party gives notice of its intention not to renew it 15 days before the end of the term. However, the agreement also states that either party may terminate the agreement 'without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.' These statements contradict each other because the renewal clause suggests that the agreement automatically continues unless notice is given, while the termination clause allows either party to end the agreement at any time with 30 days' notice, regardless of the renewal term.",

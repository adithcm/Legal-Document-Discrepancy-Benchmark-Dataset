        "explanation": "This statement grants i-on the ability to perform maintenance on the Hosted Site without providing prior notice. This is ambiguous because the definition of maintenance can vary and, without any constraints, i-on could potentially perform disruptive maintenance activities at inconvenient times for the Customer. This creates an in-text contradiction because it is implied that i-on will provide continuous operation of the Hosted Site but this clause allows i-on to disrupt that operation without warning.",

        "explanation": "This statement defines the customer's responsibility for paying the recurring monthly fee, but there is no specification of what happens if the payment is not received in 30 days. This creates ambiguity because it is not clear if the fee can increase or whether a penalty will be accessed if the payment is not received in 30 days. There is a slight in-text contradiction because it is mentioned that failure to pay may result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site, but that is not stated in this particular section.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement for the Hosted Site shall commence upon April 1, 1999 and shall continue for a period of six (6) months, unless earlier terminated in accordance with provisions hereof. This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the term and termination clauses. The agreement initially lasts for six months and automatically renews for one-month periods unless a 15-day notice is given. However, it also states that either party can terminate the agreement 'at any time' with a 30-day written notice. This creates an in-text contradiction. If the agreement is automatically renewing monthly, it is contradictory to say that it can be terminated at any time. The renewal clause suggests a continuous, albeit month-to-month, commitment unless actively canceled, while the termination clause suggests the ability to end the agreement more freely.",

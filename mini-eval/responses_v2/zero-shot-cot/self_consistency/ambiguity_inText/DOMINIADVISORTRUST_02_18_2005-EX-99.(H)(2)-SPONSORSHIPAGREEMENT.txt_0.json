        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to eliminate the standard of care typically afforded to investment advisors and managers under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and general fiduciary principles. Normally, a sponsor or advisor would only be liable for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of fiduciary duty. Holding the sponsor liable for 'any error of judgment or mistake of law' even without such culpability is an extremely high standard and likely unenforceable as it contradicts established legal principles regarding the liability of investment advisors. It effectively eliminates any reasonable business judgment protection.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a problematic limitation of liability for subcontractors. While subcontracting is permissible, the clause stating Domini is 'not fully responsible' for the subcontractor's actions except in cases of gross negligence is concerning. Domini, as the contracting party with the Trust, should generally be held responsible for ensuring the proper performance of the contract, even if that performance is delegated to a subcontractor. Limiting responsibility to gross negligence only could leave the Trust without recourse for negligent or other breaches by the subcontractor that fall short of gross negligence.",

        "explanation": "The provision dictating a penalty for termination could be deemed an unreasonable restriction on the Trust's ability to terminate the agreement. While termination fees are not per se illegal, they must be reasonable and not operate as a penalty to discourage termination. This might be considered an unreasonable penalty, especially if the Trust's average management fees are substantial.",

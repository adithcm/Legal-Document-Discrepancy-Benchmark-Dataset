        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to eliminate the standard of care typically afforded to investment advisors and managers. Generally, such professionals are only liable for losses resulting from gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a breach of fiduciary duty. Holding the Sponsor liable even for errors of judgment or mistakes of law, without any requirement of bad faith or negligence, is an extremely high standard that is unlikely to be enforceable. It contradicts general legal principles regarding the liability of investment advisors and could be deemed unconscionable.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This section contains two potential issues. First, allowing Domini to subcontract without Trustee approval regarding the subcontractor's qualifications could be problematic. The Trustees have a fiduciary duty to oversee the Trust's operations, and outsourcing critical functions to unqualified parties would be a breach of that duty. Second, limiting Domini's liability for subcontractors' actions to gross negligence provides insufficient protection to the Trust. Domini should be responsible for ensuring that subcontractors are competent and adequately supervised, and should be liable for their ordinary negligence.",

        "explanation": "The termination clause states that termination can occur 'at any time' but also requires 60 days' written notice. While not a direct contradiction, it creates ambiguity. 'At any time' suggests immediate termination, which is then contradicted by the 60-day notice requirement. This could lead to disputes over the effective date of termination. Also, assess whether the one-year penalty is reasonable and enforceable under relevant jurisdiction laws. Some jurisdictions scrutinize such penalties, especially if they appear to be punitive rather than compensatory.",

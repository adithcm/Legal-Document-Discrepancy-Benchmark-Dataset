        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to impose a standard of liability on the Sponsor (Domini) that is significantly higher than typically permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Investment advisors and those providing services to registered investment companies generally are not held liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of law unless there is evidence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of their duties. By stating that the Sponsor is 'fully liable' even without these elements, the agreement contradicts established legal principles and fiduciary standards applicable to investment companies and their service providers. This is a legal contradiction because it attempts to broaden liability beyond what the law generally allows, potentially making the clause unenforceable or subject to legal challenge.",

        "section": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, with the payment of a penalty equal to one year of the average management fees collected over the prior three years, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"at any time\" suggests that termination can occur without cause. However, imposing a penalty for termination, especially one equivalent to one year of average management fees, introduces ambiguity and potentially acts as a deterrent to the Trust terminating the agreement even if there is a valid reason to do so. The Sponsor can terminate at any time as well and pay the penalty, however, it is more ambiguous on the part of the Trust because the Sponsor is hired to manage the Trust and it is not clear why the Sponsor would simply terminate at any time.",

        "explanation": "The language absolving Domini of full responsibility for subcontractors' actions, limiting it to cases of gross negligence, creates a significant potential conflict. As the Sponsor, Domini has a fiduciary duty to oversee the Trust's administration. Subcontracting without requiring Trustee approval for the subcontractor's qualifications, combined with limited liability, weakens the Trust's protection and potentially contradicts Domini's oversight duties as defined earlier in the agreement. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the extent of Domini's responsibilities and oversight obligations.",

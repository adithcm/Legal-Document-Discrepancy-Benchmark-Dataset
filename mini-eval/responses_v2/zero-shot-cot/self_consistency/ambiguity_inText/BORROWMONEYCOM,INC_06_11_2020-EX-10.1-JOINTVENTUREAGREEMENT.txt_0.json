        "section": "The duration of this Venture (the \"Term\") will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025, unless terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the Managers.",
        "explanation": "The Term states that it begins on March 1, 2020 and ends on February 28, 2025, creating a term of exactly 5 years minus 1 day. In most legal contexts, specifying a term ending on the last day of a month simplifies calculation and avoids confusion. Ending on the 28th of February is unusual without a specific rationale.",

        "explanation": "The contract defines \"Managers\" as being appointed to manage the Venture, and then lists two individuals. However, the contract does not explicitly state whether these managers are to act individually or jointly, other than the statement in Section 10 saying Authority to bind the Venture in contract or in any third party business relation lies exclusively with the Managers, acting jointly. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes regarding the scope of each manager's authority and decision-making power.",

        "explanation": "This description is ambiguous and creates confusion. It's unclear whether the $60,000 is a one-time contribution, a monthly contribution, or an aggregate target to be reached through awarded contracts. The phrase \"From Monthly Government, City And State, And Or Private Awarded Contracts\" is grammatically incorrect and doesn't clearly define the source or timing of the contribution. Additionally, the phrase \"In Addition to The Total Contributions\" is vague, as the \"Total Contributions\" has not yet been clearly defined.",

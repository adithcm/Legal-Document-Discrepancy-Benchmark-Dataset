        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. This excludes use of likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
        "explanation": "This section defines the consultant's endorsement rather narrowly, limiting it to the use of the consultant's name in marketing materials created by Adams Golf. However, it excludes the use of the consultant's likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing. This creates an ambiguity because 'marketing materials' is not defined. It is not clear if promotional events are marketing materials or are separate from marketing materials. Promotional events include but are not limited to press interviews, radio or TV appearances.",

EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, except that CONSULTANT is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction, provided he makes a good faith effort to use ADAMS GOLF products whenever possible.",
        "explanation": "This section presents contradictory statements regarding the consultant's use of products. It initially states that the consultant shall exclusively play/use the mandatory product, implying a strict requirement. However, it then introduces an exception, stating that the consultant is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction, provided they make a good faith effort to use ADAMS GOLF products whenever possible. This creates ambiguity and an in-text contradiction as to the actual extent of the exclusivity requirement.",

        "section": "B. During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his discretion, participate in television and radio commercials, photo shoots, modeling, and promotional appearances. ADAMS GOLF shall reimburse CONSULTANT for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances. Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding compensation for promotional appearances. While it states that the consultant may participate in promotional activities at his discretion, it also specifies that Adams Golf will reimburse reasonable travel expenses for special appearances, but not session fees or residual payments for television appearances. This creates an in-text contradiction as to whether the consultant is actually acting at his own discretion if ADAMS GOLF is paying for specific things, but not others.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, except that CONSULTANT is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction, provided he makes a good faith effort to use ADAMS GOLF products whenever possible.",
        "explanation": "This clause creates an in-text contradiction. It initially states that the Consultant must exclusively use the Mandatory Product, but then allows the Consultant to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction. The 'good faith effort' is vague and doesn't resolve the conflicting obligations. The contract states that they exclusivley use the product and in the same breath says that the Consultant can use any product, thus creating a contradiction",

        "explanation": "The consultant is agreeing to protect, indemnify, and hold Adams Golf harmless. A breach of covenant or representation by the consultant is hard to quantify without detailed obligations for the consultant to follow. The contract does not specify any ways in which Adams Golf must indemnify the consultant, so this would be seen as a structural flaw from the Consultant's point of view",

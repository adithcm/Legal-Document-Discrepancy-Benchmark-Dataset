        "section": "Under this Agreement, i-on will provide the following limited services for the Hosted Site: 1. connectivity to the Internet. Specific connectivity details are outlined in a separate service level agreement (SLA).",
        "explanation": "The contract mentions a separate Service Level Agreement (SLA) that outlines the specifics of internet connectivity. By referencing an external document for essential service details (connectivity), the agreement creates ambiguity. The absence of these details within the main hosting agreement makes it difficult to determine the exact level of service i-on is obligated to provide, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes regarding service expectations and performance standards. Without the SLA, the hosting agreement has no value because it does not clearly define the scope and quality of the core service being offered.",

        "explanation": "The agreement refers to 'allocated computer storage, per #5 above'. This creates an in-text contradiction. Section #5 states 'up to 150 MB of mirrored computer storage on the Hosting Computer'. There is an ambiguity between the allocation of 150mb and 'allocated computer storage'. The vagueness surrounding storage allocation could lead to disputes, as the customer might expect more storage than i-on intends to provide for the database, especially considering the distinction between 'mirrored computer storage' and general 'computer storage.'",

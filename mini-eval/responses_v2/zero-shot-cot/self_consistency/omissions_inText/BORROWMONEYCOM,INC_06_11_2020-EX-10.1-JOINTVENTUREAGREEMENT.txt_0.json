        "explanation": "The sentence describing the JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go Member Duties contribution lacks clarity. It states the contribution is '$60,000.00 USD From Monthly Government, City And State, And Or Private Awarded Contracts. Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue From Awarded Contract, In Addition to The Total Contributions.' This statement creates ambiguity regarding what the actual amount being contributed by JVLS, LLC. Is it $60,000 from government/private contracts plus 10% of gross revenue? Or is the $60,000 meant to represent the 10% of gross revenue?",

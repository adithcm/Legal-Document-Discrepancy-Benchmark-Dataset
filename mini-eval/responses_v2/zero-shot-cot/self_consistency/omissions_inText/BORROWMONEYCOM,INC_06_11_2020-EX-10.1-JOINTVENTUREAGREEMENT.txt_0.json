        "explanation": "There are several issues in this section. Firstly, the agreed value for BorrowMoney.com, inc's contribution is 'To be determined USD', which is not a concrete value and leaves the capital contribution undefined, thus creating ambiguity. Secondly, JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go's contribution is described as '$60,000.00 USD From Monthly Government, City And State, And Or Private Awarded Contracts. Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue, In Addition to The Total Contributions' with an agreed value of $3,500,000.00 USD. The description of the contribution and the agreed value do not match. It is not clear if the $3,500,000.00 USD is the valuation of the contracts, the expected total contribution over time, or something else entirely. Also, it isn't clear whether the $60,000 is a one-time contribution or a recurring monthly amount. The phrase 'In Addition to The Total Contributions' is not explained.",

        "explanation": "This section provides that in the absence of a written agreement, the value of the Venture will be determined in a manner deemed appropriate by the remaining members, and a withdrawing member's interest will be determined at the discretion of the remaining members. This is a contradiction because it gives complete discretion to the remaining members to determine the value of the venture and the withdrawing member's interest. This could lead to unfair valuations and potential disputes, as the withdrawing member has no say in the valuation process. There are no guidelines or objective standards for determining the value, which could result in a conflict of interest and an undervaluation of the withdrawing member's interest.",

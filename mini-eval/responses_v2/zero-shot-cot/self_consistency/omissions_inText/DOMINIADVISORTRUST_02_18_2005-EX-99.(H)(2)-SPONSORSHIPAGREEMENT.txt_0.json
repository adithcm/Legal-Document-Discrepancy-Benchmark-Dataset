        "explanation": "Section 1 outlines the duties of the Sponsor, stating they will perform oversight, administrative, and management services as requested by the Trust. However, the subsequent clause contradicts this by stating the Sponsor is not responsible for the management of the Trust's assets or rendering investment advice. This creates an ambiguity: While the Sponsor provides 'management services,' they are explicitly excluded from managing the Trust's assets. This clause could be interpreted as limiting the Sponsor's management responsibilities to administrative tasks only, but it is unclear. There is ambiguity in the scope of what falls under \u201cmanagement services\u201d.",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the allocation of charges and expenses between Domini and the Trust. However, the structure is somewhat convoluted and could lead to misinterpretations. The first sentence states Domini pays the salaries of the Trust's Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini's affairs. However, the second sentence states the Trust pays compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor. This creates a possible contradiction: who pays for Trustees affiliated with the trust but spend all their time working for the trust? The structure could be improved for clarity.",

        "explanation": "This section discusses the compensation of the Sponsor. The initial sentence states that the Trust will pay Domini a mutually agreed upon fee for services and facilities. However, there is no mention of what this mutually agreed upon fee is. This omission creates ambiguity and makes it difficult to determine the actual compensation terms.

Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"as requested by the Trust\" introduces ambiguity. It's unclear whether the Sponsor is obligated to perform only those services specifically requested, or if they also have a broader responsibility for oversight, administration, and management, regardless of a specific request. This creates potential for dispute if the Trust believes the Sponsor should have performed a service that wasn't explicitly requested. Furthermore, it is not clear who within the Trust is responsible for making the request. This opens up the possibility of one person claiming one thing, and another claiming another.",

        "explanation": "While the section outlines some duties of the Sponsor, it later clarifies that the Sponsor is not responsible for the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision. The phrase \"supervising the overall administration of the Trust\" is too broad and could be interpreted as encroaching upon asset management responsibilities. This creates a gray area where it's unclear where the Sponsor's administrative supervision ends and the asset management responsibilities of others begin.",

        "explanation": "The section states that the Trust shall pay Domini a \"mutually agreed upon fee,\" but it doesn't define how this fee is initially determined or how often it's reviewed and adjusted. The contract fails to mention any mechanisms for resolving disagreements about the fee amount or the process for negotiating changes.

        "explanation": "The section discusses compensation if Domini serves for less than a full period, stating that the compensation shall be determined by mutual agreement. However, it fails to provide any guidelines or formulas for calculating this prorated compensation. For example, it does not indicate if the payment will be prorated based on the amount of days worked, or some other measurement of work done. The omission of a clear methodology for calculating prorated compensation creates ambiguity and potential for disputes about the fairness and accuracy of the payment.",

This lack of specificity creates a potential conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. The Trust has an interest in ensuring that subcontractors are qualified and competent, but this clause provides no explicit safeguards to protect that interest.

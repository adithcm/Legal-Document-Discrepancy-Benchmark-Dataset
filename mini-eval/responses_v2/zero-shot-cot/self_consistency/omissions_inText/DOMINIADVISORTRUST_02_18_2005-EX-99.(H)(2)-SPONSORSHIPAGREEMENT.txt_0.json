        "section": "Duties of the Sponsor. Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states the Sponsor provides oversight, administrative, and management services. However, the following sentences immediately limit this broad statement by saying the Sponsor is *not* responsible for asset management, investment advice, or distribution of shares. This creates a contradiction as to the actual scope of the Sponsor's duties. It's unclear what 'oversight, administrative and management services' actually entail if they exclude core functions like asset management and investment advice, especially given that these are typically central to the operation of an investment trust.",

Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in who pays the salaries of Trustees. The first sentence states that Domini pays the salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini. However, later in the section, it states the Trust pays the compensation of Trustees *not* affiliated with the Sponsor. This is inconsistent. Which entity is responsible for paying Trustee compensation depends on their affiliation, but this distinction and division of responsibility could be clearer.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "The agreement only mentions that the compensation to Domini will be a mutually agreed upon fee. This language is too vague and does not give a clear indication of the fee the Sponsor is supposed to be paid. This is a structural flaw within the text. Furthermore, the second sentence discusses the case of Domini serving as sponsor for less than a whole period but only states that compensation will be determined by 'mutual agreement'.  It lacks details about *how* the reduced compensation will be calculated or any default mechanism if an agreement cannot be reached. This ambiguity and lack of a concrete calculation method could lead to disputes.",

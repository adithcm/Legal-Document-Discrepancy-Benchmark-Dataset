        "explanation": "While it's standard to reference a 'Scope of Work' document, the contract doesn't explicitly state that the Scope of Work (Exhibit A) is *binding*. This creates ambiguity. It is unclear if the Company is required to deliver on all items listed within Exhibit A or if Exhibit A is just a guiding document, since the 'Scope of Work' does not have language of requirement.",

        "explanation": "The contract establishes a 12-week project timeline from February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018. However, section 1(b) states that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client. It then further states that Company will use its best efforts to deliver the Client Website in the time frame specified in the Scope of Work. The contradiction lies between setting a definite timeline, and then having an easy out to change the timeline, depending on the actions of the client. There is also ambiguity of what the Company has to follow in order to deliver their best efforts. There is not enough structure to determine what best efforts mean.",

However, 'completion of the Scope of Work' is subjective and undefined. What defines 'completion'? Is it the delivery of the website, client sign-off, or something else? This ambiguity could lead to disputes about when the final payment is actually due, as the criteria for completion is unclear.",

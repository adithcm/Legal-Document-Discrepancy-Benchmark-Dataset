        "explanation": "The number of required events is redacted, this omission makes it impossible to determine if the consultant has fulfilled their obligations. This creates a contradiction because later clauses state that the consultant needs to pay the company for events that they did not attend, but the specific number of tournaments that they need to compete in is missing.",

The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that upon termination due to the consultant's death or inability to play, the consultant or their estate must repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period, calculated as per paragraph 8A. However, paragraph 8A's core requirement (number of tournaments) is redacted, rendering the repayment calculation impossible.

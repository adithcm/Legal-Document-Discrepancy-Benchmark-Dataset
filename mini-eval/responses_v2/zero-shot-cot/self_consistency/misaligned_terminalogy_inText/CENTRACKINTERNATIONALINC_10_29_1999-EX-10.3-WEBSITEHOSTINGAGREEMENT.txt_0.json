        "section": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Web site\" shall mean a collection of interconnected webpages residing on the internet. A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites. The term \"Hosted Site\" shall mean the online portal of the Customer that is hosted by i-on under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Web site\" is broad and doesn't explicitly state that i-on is responsible for the customer's website content. On the other hand, the \"Hosted Site\" is specifically defined as the customer's online portal hosted by i-on, which implies i-on is responsible for the customer's website, which is a contradiction. This distinction is crucial for clarifying responsibilities regarding content, maintenance, and potential liabilities. Without clear differentiation, disputes could arise over the scope of i-on's hosting obligations.",

        "explanation": "The terms \"Customer\" and \"subscriber\" are used interchangeably but may refer to different entities. There is a contradiction in the text, since it states \"The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450\" and then the next sentance states \"The subscriber is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999.\". This implies that the customer and the subscriber are two different entities.",

        "section": "Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor may perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust, which shall include without limitation: (a) maintaining office facilities (which may be in the office of Domini or an affiliate) and furnishing clerical services necessary for maintaining the organization of the Trust and for performing the oversight, administrative and management functions herein set forth;",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"may perform such oversight...as may from time to time be reasonably requested\" creates ambiguity regarding the Sponsor's mandatory duties. While it suggests the Sponsor is obligated to perform services, the services are contingent upon being 'reasonably requested' by the Trust. This is followed by the phrase \"which shall include without limitation\", implying that the things that follow are required no matter what. This creates an in-text contradiction because it is not clear whether the services are optional or required, undermining the enforceability of these specific duties.",

        "explanation": "This section attempts to clarify the Sponsor's responsibilities by explicitly stating what they are *not* responsible for, specifically investment advice/asset management and functions already assumed by other parties (transfer agent, custodian, etc.). The phrase \"shall also be fully responsible for\" introduces an element of ambiguity. It is unclear if the phrase means that the Sponsor is responsible for investment advice, and the distribution of shares. The use of the word also implies it is above and beyond the other sections, thus, the negative contraints after that part, causes an in-text contradiction in the file.",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section delineates the allocation of charges and expenses between Domini and the Trust. It states that Domini pays the salaries of the Trust's personnel who dedicate time to Domini's affairs, while the Trust covers its operating expenses. The term 'operating expenses' is broad and includes numerous items. This section could benefit from a clearer definition of what constitutes an 'operating expense' to avoid future disputes over cost allocation, creating an in-text contradiction.",

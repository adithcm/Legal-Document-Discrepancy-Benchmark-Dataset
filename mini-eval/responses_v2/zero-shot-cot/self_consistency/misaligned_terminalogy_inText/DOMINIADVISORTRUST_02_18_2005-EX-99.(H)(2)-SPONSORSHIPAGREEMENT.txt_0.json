        "section": "Duties of the Sponsor. Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor may perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust, which shall include without limitation: (a) maintaining office facilities (which may be in the office of Domini or an affiliate) and furnishing clerical services necessary for maintaining the organization of the Trust and for performing the oversight, administrative and management functions herein set forth; (b) arranging, if desired by the Trust, for directors, officers or employees of the Sponsor to serve as Trustees, officers or agents of the Trust if duly elected or appointed to such positions and subject to their individual consent and to any limitations imposed by law; (c) supervising the overall administration of the Trust, including the updating of corporate organizational documents, and the negotiation of contracts and fees with and the monitoring and coordinating of performance and billings of the Trust's transfer agent, shareholder servicing agents (if any), custodian, administrator, subadministrator (if any) and other independent contractors or agents; (d) overseeing (with advice of the Trust's counsel) the preparation of and, if applicable, filing all documents required for compliance by the Trust with applicable laws and regulations (including state \"blue sky\" laws and regulations), including registration statements on Form N-1A, prospectuses and statements of additional information, or similar forms, as applicable, semi-annual and annual reports to shareholders and proxy statements, and reviewing tax returns; (e) preparation of agendas and supporting documents for and minutes of meetings of Trustees, committees of Trustees and preparation of notices, proxy statements and minutes of meetings of shareholders; (f) arranging for maintenance of books and records of the Trust; (g) maintaining telephone coverage to respond to shareholder inquiries regarding matters to which this Agreement pertains to which the transfer agent is unable to respond; (h) providing reports and assistance regarding each series' compliance with securities and tax laws and each series' investment objectives; (i) arranging for dissemination of yield and other performance information to newspapers and tracking services; (j) arranging for and preparing annual renewals for fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance coverage; (k) developing a budget for the Trust, establishing the rate of expense accruals and arranging for the payment of all fixed and management expenses; and (l) answering questions from the general public, the media and investors in the Trust regarding (i) the securities holdings of the Trust; (ii) any limits in which the Trust invests; (iii) the social investment philosophy of the Trust; and (iv) the proxy voting philosophy and shareholder activism philosophy of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The initial part of Section 1 outlines a broad range of administrative, oversight, and management services that the Sponsor *may* perform, subject to the Board of Trustees' direction. The use of \"may\" suggests these duties are discretionary. However, the subsequent sentence, beginning with \"Notwithstanding the foregoing,\" states the Sponsor is *not* responsible for asset management, investment advice, or share distribution. This creates a contradiction because the initial list of duties is broadly defined as 'administrative and management services' without explicitly excluding investment management, but the 'notwithstanding' clause carves out significant responsibilities that arguably fall under a general definition of 'management services.' The 'notwithstanding' clause implies that without that clarifying statement, the Sponsor *would* be responsible for asset management, investment advice, or share distribution. This section is creating confusion within the text regarding whether the Sponsor is required to perform these actions.",

The Sponsor shall be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.

        "explanation": "This section states that the Sponsor shall be liable for any error of judgement or mistake of law. Then it goes on to state that it will not be liable for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence. This is a contradiction, as the first sentence implies that the Sponsor will be liable for errors, but the second sentence provides exceptions, suggesting that certain types of errors or failures will not result in liability. The phrase \"except for\" creates a direct contradiction by introducing circumstances under which the Sponsor is *not* liable, despite the initial statement of general liability. This is confusing, as it is not clear when they will be liable and what specific situations.",

        "explanation": "This definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is unusually narrow, limiting its use to internal documentation only. This contradicts the overall purpose of the agreement, which is stated as ADAMS GOLF desiring to use the name, likeness, and endorsement of the CONSULTANT in connection with the advertisement and promotion of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. If the endorsement is only for internal documentation, the rest of the contract becomes illogical and unenforceable.",

        "explanation": "This section contradicts the definition of \"CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT\" provided in Section 2(A). Here, the endorsement is described as being used in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising, and promotion of the product. This directly conflicts with the earlier definition limiting it to ADAMS GOLF'S internal documentation.",

        "explanation": "This clause creates an ambiguity regarding expected behavior. It states that the consultant should act with due regard to public morals and conventions *unless* their actions bring additional media attention to the product. This implies that the consultant is free to disregard public morals and conventions if doing so generates publicity, which is a contradiction. The clause is also vague, what type of media attention is acceptable? This is not defined",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions, unless CONSULTANT acts in a manner that brings additional media attention to the ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT: A.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude, B.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law, C.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community, D.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT. ADAMS GOLF must exercise its right of termination within ninety (90) days of its senior management becoming aware of the conduct giving rise to the right of termination.",
        "explanation": "This entire section is structurally flawed and confusing. The initial clause about 'additional media attention' seems to contradict the following clauses (A-D) which outline specific behaviors that would allow ADAMS GOLF to terminate the agreement. It's unclear whether these specific behaviors are only grounds for termination if they *don't* bring additional media attention. The structure makes it difficult to interpret the intended consequences of the consultant's actions and ADAMS GOLF's rights.",

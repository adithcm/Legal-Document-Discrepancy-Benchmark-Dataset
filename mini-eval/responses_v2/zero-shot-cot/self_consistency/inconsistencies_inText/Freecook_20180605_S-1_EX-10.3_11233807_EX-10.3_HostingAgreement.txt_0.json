        "explanation": "This statement guarantees completion within 8 weeks, but the agreement lacks specific details regarding the penalties for delays beyond this timeframe. The phrase \"as specified elsewhere in this Agreement\" implies that penalties are outlined, however, no such penalties are mentioned anywhere else. This is an in-text contradiction because the text refers to penalties that don't exist within the agreement.",

        "explanation": "The contract states two different time frames for the completion of the project. The project terms outline a 12 week completion time, however, the document guarantees project completion within 8 weeks. This creates an ambiguity and it is unclear whether the company has 8 weeks or 12 weeks to complete the project.",

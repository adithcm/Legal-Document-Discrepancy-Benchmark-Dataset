        "explanation": "This section outlines the duties of each member. For JVLS, LLC, it states that they need to pay $60,000 within 90 days. The term 'Generated Gross Revenue From Awarded Contract' is vague. It's not clear what defines an 'awarded contract'. This is ambiguous in text, leading to potential disputes over what revenue is subject to the 10% contribution.",

JVLS, LLC contributes $60,000 in cash plus 10% of the generated gross revenue, which is valued at $3,500,000.00 USD. It is highly unlikely that $60,000 plus 10% of revenue would equal the same amount as 1,500 square feet of office space. This seems like a mistake or a misrepresentation of value.

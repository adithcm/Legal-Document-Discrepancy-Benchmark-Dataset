In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows: The agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year: 1. Year 1. $[*****] 2. Year 2 $[*****] 3. Year 3 $[*****] 4. Year 4 $[*****] 5. Year 5 $[*****] B.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within three months following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than March 31, 2006. C.In the event that CONSULTANT is prevented from competing for reasons outside his control, the parties agree to a good faith attempt to resolve the issues. If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'satisfactory record of play' is not defined in the contract. This ambiguity creates uncertainty as to what constitutes a satisfactory record of play. The absence of a clear definition gives ADAMS GOLF significant discretion in determining whether the consultant has met the minimum requirements, potentially leading to disputes.",

However, if ADAMS GOLF is terminating the agreement due to the consultant's breach, requiring repayment seems punitive. It might be more appropriate to only seek damages directly related to the breach, rather than a full repayment based on a potentially unrelated performance clause.

This creates an in-text contradiction because without the knowledge of the end date, it is hard to figure out the obligations of both parties, and how long the obligations are in effect.",

In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:",
        "explanation": "Here the first section is redacted. We don't know the minimum number of professional golf association events the CONSULTANT shall achieve, but the following sentence references this missing information. This creates an in-text contradiction because we do not know how to correctly interpret this section of the contract. If the CONSULTANT fails to meet the minimum, it is also not clear as to how much he should repay, because the minimum is not defined.",

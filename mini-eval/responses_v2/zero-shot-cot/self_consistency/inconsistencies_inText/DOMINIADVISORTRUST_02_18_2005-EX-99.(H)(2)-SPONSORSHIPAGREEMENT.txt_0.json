        "section": "The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section states that legal counsel fees will be covered by Domini but it does not say when, how or what the limit is of this payment. This means that there is no clear indication of the extent of the expenses covered by Domini. In addition to that, this goes on to say that the trust is responsible for paying for 'all' of its operating expenses. The use of 'all' here is in contradiction to the legal fees that Domini is covering, as that would be considered part of the operating expenses of the Trust. This is an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'at any time' and the inclusion of a penalty fee but without a specified reason can be seen as an ambiguity. The contradiction lies in the fact that contracts are made with the intent to be upheld through the duration of the contract unless certain conditions are met and agreed upon that breaks the contract. The phrase 'at any time' is ambiguous as it implies that the contract can be broken for any reason at all, as long as the fee is paid. Because contract law dictates that there has to be a more concrete reason to break a contract, this is a contradiction.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini is not responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor.",
        "explanation": "In most legal agreements, the main contractor is responsible for the actions of a sub-contractor. This is because when the Trust contracted Domini, they did so with the expectation that Domini is competent and qualified to fulfill the obligations of the contract, and Domini is responsible for vetting and ensuring the subcontractor can perform their duties. By stating that Domini is not responsible for the acts of the sub-contractor, it creates a loophole that absolves Domini of liability, which goes against standard legal practices and expectations. If the sub-contractor does not perform their duty, then Domini would be in breach of contract, which is in direct contradiction to the statement that it is not liable.",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the allocation of expenses between Domini and the Trust. It states that Domini covers the salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini's affairs, and also covers legal counsel fees. However, it also states that the Trust will pay compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor. It is ambiguous what is considered an affiliate. This could create ambiguity and potential disputes about which party is responsible for certain expenses, especially if a trustee's affiliation status is unclear.",

        "explanation": "This section is outlining the allocation of expenses between the trust and Domini. However, the structure of the sentence is awkward, and it could cause confusion, and does not make sense. There is no clarity on which party will pay fees.",

        "explanation": "The section specifies that the agreement can be terminated \"at any time\" but includes a penalty of $10,000. There is an inconsistency between being able to terminate a contract at any time, and having to pay a penalty. If termination is truly allowed at any time, a penalty is a contradiction. The phrase \"at any time\" suggests no restrictions. The penalty introduces a significant restriction.",

        "explanation": "The clause allows termination \"with respect to any series or the Trust.\" The phrasing is unclear. Does termination with respect to \"any series\" mean a single series can be terminated while the agreement remains in effect for other series? Or does it mean the entire agreement can be terminated if any one series is terminated? The ambiguity could lead to disputes over the scope of a termination.",

        "explanation": "This creates a loophole where Domini is not liable for the actions of its subcontractors. This is a legal contradiction because it attempts to relieve Domini of liability for actions taken on its behalf, which could violate principles of agency law where a principal is typically responsible for the acts of its agents or subcontractors. Without specific limitations or standards of care required for subcontractors, this could leave the Trust vulnerable to damages caused by the subcontractor without recourse against Domini.",

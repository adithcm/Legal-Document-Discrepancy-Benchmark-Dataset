        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The section outlines the allocation of charges and expenses between Domini and the Trust. Domini covers salaries for Trust personnel who also work for Domini and legal counsel fees, while the Trust covers all other operating expenses. However, the phrase \"legal counsel fees which Domini will cover\" is vague. It doesn't specify the extent or limitations of this coverage. For example, it doesn't clarify whether Domini covers all legal fees, or only those related to specific matters. This ambiguity can lead to disputes over which legal fees Domini is actually responsible for.",

        "explanation": "This section lists a number of expenses that the trust shall pay. The use of \"including but not limited to\" creates a structural issue. The phrase makes the list non-exhaustive. This means that there is no clear definition of what is or is not part of the operating expenses.",

        "explanation": "This section allows the agreement to be terminated at any time. This contradicts the idea that this is supposed to be a long term contract, due to the nature of the agreement. This creates an inconsistency that implies that either party can terminate the contract, but then it also has a penalty of $10,000 dollars which is more in line with a long term contract.",

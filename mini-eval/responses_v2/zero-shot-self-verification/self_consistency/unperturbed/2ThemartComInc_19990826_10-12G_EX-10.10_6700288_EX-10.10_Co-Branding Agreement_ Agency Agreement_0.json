        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  <*$p$*>In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This clause introduces a contradiction. It states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement, but then adds that the agreement is automatically renewed if neither party provides notice of non-renewal. These two statements contradict each other; renewal cannot be both by mutual agreement and automatic.",

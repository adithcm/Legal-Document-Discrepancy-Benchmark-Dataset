        "section": "The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract specifies a term length in years and months but fails to provide the specific termination date. This omission creates an in-text contradiction as the agreement defines a duration without a clear endpoint, making it impossible to definitively determine the agreement's full term.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph allows ADAMS GOLF to terminate the agreement if CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play golf. It also states that upon termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. In the event of death, it is illogical and potentially unenforceable to require the repayment of compensation, as the inability to perform is due to an event beyond the CONSULTANT'S control. This contradicts the principle that repayment is typically associated with a failure to fulfill contractual obligations due to reasons within the control of the performing party.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This paragraph states that if either party commits a material breach of this Agreement, the other party may terminate for cause and CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. This paragraph is written that if ADAMS GOLF is in breach of the agreement, CONSULTANT must pay back ADAMS GOLF. This does not make sense.",

        "section": "4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor\nshall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor\nmay request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's\nreasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray\nshall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra\ninsurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the\nneed to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray,\nif such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if\na Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses\nrequired in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was\nOctober 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "The section states that if the delivery deadline requested is at least six months after the purchase order, Accuray will pay for expedited delivery, but if it is not they will not pay. This section is contradictory because there are no specifications if it is more than 6 months. For example, if it is 7 months after the delivery date, who pays for the expedited delivery?",

        "explanation": "The sentence states that the warranty is for one year following the installation of the product. However, it also states the installation cannot exceed 18 months following the shipment. This creates ambiguity within the text because the installation can be performed by someone other than Accuray, so they have no control over when it is installed. This makes the one year warranty unclear.",

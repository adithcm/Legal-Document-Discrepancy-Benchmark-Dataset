        "explanation": "The redaction of the term length and end date introduces ambiguity. Without knowing the specific number of years and months, it's impossible to determine the exact termination date. This omission creates an in-text contradiction because the agreement refers to a 'term' but doesn't clearly define its duration, making it difficult to ascertain the parties' obligations at any given time.",

        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is limited to Adams Golf's internal documentation. This is contradictory because the agreement's stated purpose is to grant Adams Golf the right to use the consultant's name and likeness in connection with the advertisement and promotion of Adams Golf's product. Section 3 states: CONSULTANT hereby gives and grants to ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right and license to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT in the CONTRACT TERRITORY. Limiting the endorsement to internal documentation would not allow for the advertising and promotion mentioned in other sections.",

        "explanation": "The use of \"without limitation\" in the initial sentence of this section implies that the subsequent list of duties is not exhaustive, and the Sponsor may be required to perform other duties reasonably requested by the Trust. However, the sentence beginning with \"Notwithstanding the foregoing\" then limits the Sponsor's responsibilities by stating what they are NOT responsible for. The phrase 'Notwithstanding the foregoing' creates a contradiction because it suggests that the listed duties are comprehensive, contradicting the initial statement of \"without limitation.\"",

        "explanation": "The first sentence states that Domini pays the salaries of Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini's affairs.

        "explanation": "This section introduces a potential ambiguity. While it states Domini is willing to provide 'oversight, administrative, and management services,' the specific nature and scope of these services are not clearly defined here. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes later on regarding the exact responsibilities Domini is expected to fulfill. This statement seems to imply a broad role, but the actual duties outlined in Section 1 might be interpreted as narrower. Thus, this can cause confusion about what is truly expected from Domini in terms of management.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'may perform such...services as may from time to time be reasonably requested' introduces ambiguity. The use of 'may' suggests that Domini's performance of these services is discretionary rather than obligatory. This contradicts the earlier statement in the preamble suggesting a willingness to provide these services. The term 'reasonably requested' is also vague, as it doesn't define what constitutes a 'reasonable' request, potentially leading to disagreements.",

        "explanation": "The text lacks structural clarity, specifically when detailing the duties of the sponsor. The long list of responsibilities in sections (d), (e), (f), and (g) are not broken up with any sort of structural markers, therefore making the text difficult to read and comprehend.

        "explanation": "Section 1(l) outlines Domini's responsibility for answering questions about the Trust's securities holdings, investment limits, and philosophies. However, the disclaimer that 'the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series' is contradictory. Answering questions about securities holdings and investment limits inherently involves some level of investment advice or commentary, which this clause seems to prohibit.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Sponsor' includes Domini's affiliates and their personnel, which broadens the scope of liability limitations. While common, the term 'reckless disregard' is vague. This creates ambiguity and could lead to a situation where the Sponsor acts negligently, causing harm, but argues that their actions didn't meet the high threshold of 'reckless disregard,' thus avoiding liability. This ambiguity could enable a potential breach of duty, where the Sponsor harms the Trust but manages to avoid liability due to the vague term.",

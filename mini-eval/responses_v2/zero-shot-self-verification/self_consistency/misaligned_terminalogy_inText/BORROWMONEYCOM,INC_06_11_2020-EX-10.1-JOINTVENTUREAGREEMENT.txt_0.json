It's unclear whether the $60,000 is a one-time contribution, an ongoing monthly contribution, or something else entirely. The phrase \"Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue, In Add i t i on to The To ta l Contributions.\" is vague because it doesn't specify the timeframe for this additional revenue share. Is it monthly, annually, or over the term of the agreement? The inconsistency in spacing adds to the confusion. This lack of clarity leads to multiple interpretations, which is a characteristic of ambiguity. The way the monetary contributions are detailed structurally does not make sense and is hard to understand.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a contradictory statement. It first states that if joint ventures are not recognized, property will be held in the name of one or more members. However, it then states that in all cases Venture property will be applied by the Members exclusively for the benefit and purposes of the Venture. If the joint venture is not recognized, then the Member has total control of the assets, meaning they can technically do what they want with the funds.

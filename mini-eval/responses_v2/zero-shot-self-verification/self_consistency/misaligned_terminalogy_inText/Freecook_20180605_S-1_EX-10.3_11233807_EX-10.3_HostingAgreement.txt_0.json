        "section": "Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". The costs of any such changes shall be added to the Contract Price. Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Additional Work' is broad and includes 'significant changes in the Scope of Work.' However, it also includes very specific items such as 'more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions.' This creates ambiguity because a change could be considered 'significant' even if it doesn't involve multiple revisions, or vice versa. It's unclear if both conditions (being 'significant' and involving multiple revisions) must be met for it to be considered 'Additional Work'.",

Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",
        "explanation": "While a specific timeframe is outlined (February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018, totaling 12 weeks), the clause also states that any due dates are 'subject to delay' due to various client-related factors. This undermines the certainty of the initial timeframe. The contract lacks clarity regarding how these delays will be handled, what constitutes a reasonable delay, and whether the client is entitled to any recourse if the project is significantly delayed due to the company's actions or other unforeseen circumstances.",

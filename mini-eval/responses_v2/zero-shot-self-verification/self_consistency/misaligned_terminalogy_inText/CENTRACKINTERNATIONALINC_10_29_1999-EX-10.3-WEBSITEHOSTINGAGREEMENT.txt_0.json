This is in contrast to the definition of \"Hosted Site,\" which is specifically linked to the Customer and hosted by i-on. While not directly contradictory, the lack of clarity regarding website ownership and control could lead to disputes about responsibility for content or actions taken on a general \"Web site\" mentioned in the agreement.",

The starting date is April 1, 1999, so it is not clear when the fees are to be paid. Does this mean the subscriber is responsible for paying the fee 4 days later?",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"one (1) or more one (1) month periods\" is unclear. This is ambiguity in the text because it is not specific.

        "explanation": "The contract states continuous operation except for maintenance but then allows i-on to schedule and perform maintenance at its convenience, without prior notice. This creates ambiguity. While some maintenance is expected, the lack of notice or defined limits could lead to extended or frequent downtime, contradicting the promise of continuous operation.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that the initial term is for six months, with automatic one-month renewals unless a 15-day notice is given. It also states that either party can terminate the agreement at any time with a 30-day written notice. This creates an inconsistency. If a party gives a 30-day notice to terminate, it is unclear if this overrides the 15-day notice requirement for non-renewal, especially if the 30-day notice falls within the 15-day window before the end of a renewal term.",

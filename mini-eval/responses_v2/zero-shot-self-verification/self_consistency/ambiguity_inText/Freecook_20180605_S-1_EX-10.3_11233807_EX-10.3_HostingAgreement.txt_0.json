        "explanation": "This statement is overly broad and potentially unenforceable. It attempts to eliminate any possibility of delay, which is unrealistic in software development. Unforeseen circumstances, such as illness, technical difficulties, or changes requested by the client, could legitimately cause delays. A blanket statement preventing any delay, regardless of cause, is unreasonable and may be challenged in court. It contradicts common business practices and legal principles regarding reasonable expectations and force majeure.",

        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This section allows Domini to subcontract its obligations without needing approval from the Trustees regarding the subcontractor's qualifications. Additionally, it states that Domini is only responsible for the subcontractor's actions in cases of gross negligence. This is a contradiction because Domini should be responsible for ensuring the subcontractor is qualified to perform the obligations, and limiting liability to only gross negligence is not standard practice.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. This contradicts standard legal practice, which typically requires some level of negligence or misconduct for liability to be established. It creates an extremely high standard of care for the Sponsor.",

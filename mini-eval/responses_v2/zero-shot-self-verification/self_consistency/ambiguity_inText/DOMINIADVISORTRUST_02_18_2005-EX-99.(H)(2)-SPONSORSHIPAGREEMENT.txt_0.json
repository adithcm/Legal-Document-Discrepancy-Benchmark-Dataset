        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This section states that Domini is not fully responsible for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors, except in cases of gross negligence. This contradicts standard legal principles, which generally hold a contracting party responsible for the performance of its subcontractors. By disclaiming full responsibility, the contract creates a loophole where the Trust may have limited recourse for damages caused by subcontractors, even if those damages arise from breaches of contract or negligence below the level of gross negligence. This is a discrepancy.",

        "explanation": "This section imposes a very high standard of liability on the Sponsor, making them liable even for simple errors of judgment or mistakes of law, even in the absence of negligence or bad faith. This is highly unusual and contradicts the general principle that liability typically requires some level of fault, such as negligence or willful misconduct. This discrepancy creates an imbalance of risk, making the Sponsor potentially liable for losses that are not their direct fault.",

        "explanation": "This clause states that Domini pays the salaries of the Trust's Trustees, officers, and agents who devote their time to Domini's affairs and that these salaries are not considered expenses of the Trust. This creates an ambiguity because it's unclear if Domini is paying salaries for work done for the trust and then not being reimbursed, or if it is only paying people that work for Domini, which would make this section not relevant.",

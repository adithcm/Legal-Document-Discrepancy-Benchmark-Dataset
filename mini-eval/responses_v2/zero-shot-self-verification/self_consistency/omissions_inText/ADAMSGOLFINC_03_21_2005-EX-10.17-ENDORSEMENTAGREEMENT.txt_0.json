        "section": "B.\"PRODUCT\" shall mean all golf clubs including, but not limited to, metal woods, drivers, fairway woods, irons and putters.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"PRODUCT\" is broad and encompasses all golf clubs. However, the term \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" is then introduced which specifies certain ADAMS GOLF products that the CONSULTANT must exclusively play/use. This creates an ambiguity because while 'PRODUCT' includes all golf clubs, the consultant is only obligated to use specific 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS'. This could lead to disputes about what constitutes compliance with the agreement.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT.",
        "explanation": "This section mandates the exclusive use of \"MANDATORY PRODUCT\". This statement, read in isolation, is clear. However, in conjunction with section 7 (CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT), it creates a potential contradiction. Section 7 allows the CONSULTANT to notify ADAMS GOLF if the \"MANDATORY PRODUCT\" is unsuitable and gives ADAMS GOLF the option to either provide a suitable replacement or terminate the agreement. If ADAMS GOLF fails to provide a suitable replacement and doesn't terminate the agreement, the consultant is still bound to exclusively use a product they deem unsuitable. This creates an in-text contradiction because it is not practical.",

        "section": "7. CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the MANDATORY PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines a procedure if the consultant finds the MANDATORY PRODUCT unsuitable. ADAMS GOLF has 30 days to provide a suitable replacement or terminate the agreement. However, it doesn't explicitly state what happens if ADAMS GOLF does neither. This omission creates a significant loophole. Does the consultant remain obligated to use unsuitable products? Can they then use competitive products? This lack of clarity creates an in-text contradiction with the exclusivity clauses.",

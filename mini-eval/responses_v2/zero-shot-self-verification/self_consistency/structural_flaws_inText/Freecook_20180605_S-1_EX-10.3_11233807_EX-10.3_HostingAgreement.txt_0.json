        "explanation": "This section creates an unrealistic and potentially unenforceable obligation on the Company. It states that the Company guarantees the due dates regardless of whether they receive necessary information from the client. This is contradictory because project timelines are inherently dependent on client input. If the client is late providing information, it is illogical to hold the company to the original deadlines.",

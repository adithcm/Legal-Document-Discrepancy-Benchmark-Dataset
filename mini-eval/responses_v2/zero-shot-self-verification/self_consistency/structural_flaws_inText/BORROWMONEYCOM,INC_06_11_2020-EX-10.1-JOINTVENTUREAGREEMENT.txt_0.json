        "explanation": "The description lacks clarity and precision. It's unclear what specific technical aspects are included, the exact nature of the database, and the level of expertise required from the assigned employees. The phrase 'medical dispatch personal & product service as needed' is vague and could be interpreted in multiple ways. The ambiguous language makes it difficult to enforce specific obligations regarding BorrowMoney.com, inc.'s responsibilities.",

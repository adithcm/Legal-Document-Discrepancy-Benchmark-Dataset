        "explanation": "The initial sentence defines the purpose of the joint venture as \"IT Development. internet Back office Maintenance And Deployment of medical Service.\" However, the subsequent sentence grants BorrowMoney.com, inc. the sole discretion to change this purpose at any time. This creates a contradiction, because the stated exclusive purpose is not actually exclusive, as it can be unilaterally altered. This undermines the mutual agreement aspect of a joint venture, suggesting BorrowMoney.com, inc. has significantly more power.",

        "explanation": "This section contradicts the fundamental principle of a joint venture, which is based on mutual agreement and benefit. Allowing one member, BorrowMoney.com, inc., to unilaterally amend the agreement regardless of the other member's objections undermines the collaborative nature of the venture. It creates an imbalance of power and could be seen as a breach of good faith.",

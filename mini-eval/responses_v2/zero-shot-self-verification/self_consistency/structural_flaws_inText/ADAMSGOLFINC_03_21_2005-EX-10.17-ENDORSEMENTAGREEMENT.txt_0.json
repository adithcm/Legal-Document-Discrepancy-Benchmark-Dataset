        "section": "CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is ambiguous and overly restrictive. By limiting the endorsement to the use of the consultant's name *only*, and excluding virtually every other attribute associated with his persona (likeness, image, etc.) the value of the endorsement is significantly diminished. This creates ambiguity because the contract later discusses the use of Consultant's 'name and/or likeness' in other sections. This creates an in-text contradiction, because section 2A is stating that the endorsement is strictly limited to the use of the name only, however, the contract also mentions 'name and/or likeness' in section 4D, which leads to multiple interpretations.",

He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible' is contradictory when coupled with the statement that the consultant 'may, at his sole discretion, use any golf clubs he desires, including those from competitors.' This creates an in-text contradiction, because the text is ambiguous.",

The actual base compensation shall be determined annually based on Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion. No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and contradiction regarding base compensation. The initial statement suggests a potential base compensation 'up to' a certain amount, however, the following sentences state that the 'actual base compensation shall be determined annually based on Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion. No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.' Because the amount of compensation is up to Adams Golf, and the consultant has to agree to it, the wording is vague and makes the agreement to provide compensation ambiguous. This could cause the consultant to fulfill his part of the contract without a guarantee of compensation.",

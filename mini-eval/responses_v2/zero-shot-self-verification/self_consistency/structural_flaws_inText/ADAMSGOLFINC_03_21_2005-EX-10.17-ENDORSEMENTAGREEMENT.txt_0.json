        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is overly restrictive. By limiting it to only the use of the CONSULTANT's name and excluding other identifying characteristics, the contract creates ambiguity about what constitutes a legitimate endorsement. This could lead to disputes over whether ADAMS GOLF is properly utilizing the CONSULTANT's endorsement within the confines of this narrow definition. For example, if ADAMS GOLF uses a picture of the CONSULTANT next to his name, it would be difficult to determine whether this falls within the agreement.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his sole discretion, use any golf clubs he desires, including those from competitors. He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction regarding the CONSULTANT's obligation to use MANDATORY PRODUCTS. While he is 'encouraged' to use them and is required to use them in all Champions/Senior Professional Golf Association (SPGA) and Professional Golf Association (PGA) events at all times based on section 2.C, this section states he may use any golf clubs he desires. It also says he can endorse other clubs. This creates ambiguity about the extent of the CONSULTANT's obligation to use ADAMS GOLF products.",

        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding the CONSULTANT's compensation. While it states ADAMS GOLF 'may' pay a base compensation, it also says 'no compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.' This creates ambiguity as to whether there is any obligation on ADAMS GOLF to pay any compensation at all and contradicts the general purpose of an endorsement agreement.",

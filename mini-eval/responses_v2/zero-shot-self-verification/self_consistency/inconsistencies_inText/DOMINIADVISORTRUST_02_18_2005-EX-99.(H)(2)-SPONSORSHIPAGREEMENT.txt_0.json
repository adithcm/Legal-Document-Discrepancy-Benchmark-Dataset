        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. <*$p$*>Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The provision is ambiguous because it states that Domini will cover legal counsel fees, implying that the Trust will not pay these fees. However, it also includes legal counsel fees as part of the Trust's 'other operating expenses.' This creates a contradiction because it is unclear which party is responsible for covering the Trust's legal counsel fees.",

        "explanation": "The text indicates that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time' with a penalty of $10,000. The phrase 'at any time' contradicts the clause that specifies termination requires 'not less than 60 days' written notice'. The unconditional 'at any time' suggests immediate termination, while the notice period implies a delay, creating an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The clause regarding the alteration or amendment of the agreement is a structural flaw, as it is placed after the termination clause, disrupting the logical flow of conditions related to the duration and ending of the agreement.

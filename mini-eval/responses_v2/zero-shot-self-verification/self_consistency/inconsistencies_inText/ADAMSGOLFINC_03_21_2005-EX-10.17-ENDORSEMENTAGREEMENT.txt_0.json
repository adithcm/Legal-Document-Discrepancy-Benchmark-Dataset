        "explanation": "The redaction of the specific mandatory products creates an in-text contradiction. The contract mandates exclusive use of 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS,' but the definition of what constitutes these products is heavily redacted, making it impossible to determine which products the consultant is obligated to use.

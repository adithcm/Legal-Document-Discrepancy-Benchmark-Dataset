        "explanation": "The language \"one (1) or more one (1) month periods\" is vague. It's unclear if renewal is automatic for a single month, or if it can be for multiple months, and how that is determined. This creates potential for dispute upon renewal because it's ambiguous how long the agreement will be renewed for.",

        "explanation": "This clause appears contradictory. It states either party can terminate without cause with 30 days written notice, BUT the customer is still obligated to pay ALL amounts due, even after termination. This is contradictory, because if the agreement is terminated, there would be no further amounts due.",

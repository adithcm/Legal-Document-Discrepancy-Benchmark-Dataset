        "explanation": "The text initially states that i-on will maintain the Hosted Site continuously, 24/7, but then immediately introduces an exception for maintenance. The second sentence further allows i-on to perform maintenance at any time, including weekdays. This creates ambiguity and contradicts the promise of continuous operation, as maintenance downtime is not clearly defined or limited, potentially allowing for frequent or lengthy interruptions.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The clause outlines two different ways to end the agreement. The first is with a five-day notice before the end of the term, and the second is with thirty days written notice to terminate the agreement without cause. The thirty-day notice essentially negates the five-day notice because a party could always just use the thirty-day termination clause, making the five-day notice irrelevant.

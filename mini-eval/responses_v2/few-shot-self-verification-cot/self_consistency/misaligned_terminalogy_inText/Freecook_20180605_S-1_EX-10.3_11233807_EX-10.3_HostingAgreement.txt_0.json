        "explanation": "The text states Natalija Tunevic is the director of FreeCook, but then in the same sentence states that the agreement is between Natalija Tunevic and Mitchell Vitalis. This is a contradiction as Natalija Tunevic's title (director of FreeCook) does not correlate with her name.",

It is Client's sole responsibility to check the accuracy of the written content and correct any errors prior to submission for final publication. Entity will assume that all the written content submitted by Client has been proofread and is ready for publication.",
        "explanation": "The text refers to \"Service Provider\" at the beginning and then switches to \"Entity\" in the third sentence. This misalignment in terminology creates confusion as to who is assuming responsibility for the content being proofread. This inconsistency makes the clause internally contradictory.",

Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements about customer service. The first sentence mandates that the 'Service Provider' shall provide customer support. Then the modified sentences change 'Service Provider' to 'Company', which introduces a misalignment in terminology as the responsibilities are shifted between the Service Provider and Company and then makes the commitment optional, creating an internal contradiction. The last sentences gives the company the discretion to cease the Customer Service.",

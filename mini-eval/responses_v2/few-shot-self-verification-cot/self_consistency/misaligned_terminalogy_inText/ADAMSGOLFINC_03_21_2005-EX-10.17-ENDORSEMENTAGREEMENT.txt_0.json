        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is restricted to ADAMS GOLF'S internal documentation. However, Section 3 grants ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right and license to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT. This contradiction arises because Section 3 grants rights beyond internal documentation, while Section 2A limits it to internal use only. This creates ambiguity as to the scope of ADAMS GOLF'S endorsement rights.",

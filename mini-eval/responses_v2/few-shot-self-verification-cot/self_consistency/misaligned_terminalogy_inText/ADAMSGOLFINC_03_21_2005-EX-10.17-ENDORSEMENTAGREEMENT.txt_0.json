        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image solely in ADAMS GOLF'S internal documentation.",
        "explanation": "This definition of 'Endorsement' is unusually narrow and contradicts the overall purpose of the agreement, which is to have Tom Watson endorse Adams Golf's products to the public. Limiting the endorsement to 'internal documentation' makes the entire agreement questionable and nonsensical, given the explicit mention of advertisement and promotion in the 'WITNESSETH' section and various clauses that refer to promotional appearances, advertising approval, etc. This creates a fundamental contradiction in the contract because the operative sections rely on a broader understanding of 'Endorsement' than the provided definition.",

        "section": "B.\"PRODUCT\" shall mean only metal woods and drivers.",
        "explanation": "While defining product is necessary, in Section 5, it says 'CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT'. Then in the next sentence 'It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.' This creates a contradiction in that the agreement limits 'Product' to metal woods and drivers, but then it acknowledges and permits Watson to use other clubs (like a putter) from other manufacturers. However, Section 6 further complicates this by saying, 'if CONSULTANT endorses or promotes a non-competitive product and in that endorsement or promotion CONSULTANT wears, plays, uses, holds or is in any way associated with a product that would constitute PRODUCT as defined under this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall use objectively reasonable best efforts to ensure that PRODUCT is an ADAMS GOLF PRODUCT'. This creates a confusion as it states that if he endorses a non-competitive product and is associated with another 'product', then he has to use 'best efforts' to make sure that it is the Adams golf product, even though the agreement already states that other clubs from other manufactures are acceptable. The contract fails to clearly define what constitutes 'Product' in different contexts, leading to potential disputes.",

        "explanation": "This clause presents a direct contradiction. It initially requires the consultant to act with regard to public morals and conventions, but then introduces an exception: this requirement is waived if the consultant's actions, regardless of their alignment with public morals, bring additional media attention to Adams Golf's product. This implicitly encourages behavior that might be considered immoral or unconventional, creating an inconsistency in the expected standard of conduct. What happens if there is negative media attention, would this exception still apply?",

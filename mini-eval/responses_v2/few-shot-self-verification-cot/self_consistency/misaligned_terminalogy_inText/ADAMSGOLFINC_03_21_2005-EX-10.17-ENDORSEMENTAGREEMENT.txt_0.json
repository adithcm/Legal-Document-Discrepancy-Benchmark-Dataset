        "explanation": "The contract states that the term commences on September 1, 2004, and is for a certain number of years and months, but the exact duration and termination date are redacted, thus it is structurally flawed. This lack of a defined end date makes the contract's duration ambiguous and makes the terms of the contract not structured correctly because the terms are unknown due to redaction. This contradicts the concept of a 'term' having a defined beginning and end.",

        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is limited to Adams Golf's internal documentation. Later, Section 3, grants Adams Golf 'the exclusive right and license to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT'. This creates a contradiction because Section 2A says endorsements are only for internal use, while Section 3 expands that to be used for advertising. It is not aligned with the definitions and usages of these terms.",

        "section": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Web site\" shall mean a collection of interconnected webpages residing on the internet. A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites. The term \"Hosted Site\" shall mean the online portal of the Customer that is hosted by i-on under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Web site\" is broad and generic, applying to any collection of webpages. However, the definition of \"Hosted Site\" specifically refers to \"the online portal of the Customer that is hosted by i-on under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\" While it's clear that the Hosted Site is a specific type of Web site, the contract doesn't explicitly state the relationship between them. This lack of clarity could lead to confusion about which terms apply to all Web sites and which apply specifically to the Hosted Site. For example, if i-on provides connectivity to 'Web sites', does that include all Web sites or just hosted sites?",

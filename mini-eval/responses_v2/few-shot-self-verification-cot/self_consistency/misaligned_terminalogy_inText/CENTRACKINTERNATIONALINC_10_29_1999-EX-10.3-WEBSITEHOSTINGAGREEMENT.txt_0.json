        "explanation": "This section promises continuous operation but then allows for maintenance. While necessary, the term 'reasonable' is ambiguous and undefined. What constitutes 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance' is subjective. This vagueness can lead to disputes if the customer feels that the amount or frequency of maintenance is excessive and disrupts their service beyond what they consider reasonable.",

        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the payment schedule specified in the document. The agreement states that the monthly fee is $450, and that payment is due by the 5th of each month, beginning April 1, 1999. However, the phrase 'beginning in April 1, 1999' is contradictory because the payment date is specified as the 5th of the month.",

        "explanation": "The statement 'The Customer shall comply with applicable laws, standards, policies, and procedures' is vague. It is missing the 'applicable laws, standards, policies, and procedures' of which governing entity the customer must follow. It is unknown if it is i-on's policies, state law, federal law, or other international treaties, for example, that the customer must follow. Because the laws that the customer must follow are not clearly defined, it could be argued that it is not enforcable.",

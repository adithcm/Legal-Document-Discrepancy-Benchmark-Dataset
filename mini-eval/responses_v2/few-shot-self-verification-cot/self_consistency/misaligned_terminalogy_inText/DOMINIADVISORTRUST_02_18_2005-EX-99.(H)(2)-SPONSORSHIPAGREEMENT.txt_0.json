Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"the Sponsor may perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust\" implies that the Sponsor has the option to perform these services. However, the subsequent list details specific duties, suggesting a mandatory obligation. This creates an ambiguity: is the Sponsor obligated to perform all listed duties, or only those it chooses to perform, subject to the Trust's requests? The word \"may\" creates ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "This clause states that the Sponsor is responsible for \"overseeing\" the preparation and filing of compliance documents, \"with advice of the Trust's counsel\". This creates a structural flaw in the roles of responsibilities as it is unclear on who has the responsibility of the filing. It is not specified if the Trust's counsel has ultimate responsibility for accuracy and compliance, or if the Sponsor retains some independent obligation beyond simply receiving advice. If the counsel advises against a filing, who has the final say? This undefined relationship creates structural ambiguity and potential for conflict. If filing goes wrong, who is responsible? Sponsor? Trust Counsel?",

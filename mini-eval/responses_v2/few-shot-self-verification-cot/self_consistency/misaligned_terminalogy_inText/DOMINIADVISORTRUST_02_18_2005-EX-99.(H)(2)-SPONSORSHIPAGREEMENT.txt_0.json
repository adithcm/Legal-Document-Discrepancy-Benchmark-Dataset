        "explanation": "The statement suggests Domini will provide 'certain' oversight, administrative, and management services as defined later. However, Section 1 then expands Domini's duties to include 'such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust.' This open-ended addition contradicts the 'certain' services mentioned earlier, creating ambiguity. It's unclear if Domini is only obligated to the initially intended specific services or any service the Trust reasonably requests.",

        "explanation": "This section assigns supervisory and coordinating responsibilities to the Sponsor regarding various agents of the Trust (transfer agent, custodian, etc.). However, later in Section 1, it states, '...nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.' This creates a direct contradiction. Domini *is* given supervisory responsibilities over those entities, but then the agreement states they *aren't* responsible for the functions of those entities. This leaves ambiguity on the exact level of responsibility Domini holds.",

        "explanation": "This attempts to define the Sponsor's liability. However, it initially states the Sponsor *is* liable for 'any error of judgment or mistake of law' then immediately negates this by stating it *isn't* liable except in cases of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard. The initial phrase, without the exception, would set an extremely high and likely untenable standard of liability. The exception essentially swallows the rule, making it unclear precisely what errors or mistakes the Sponsor is responsible for that don't fall within the specified exclusions. This is a poorly structured sentence that creates significant ambiguity.",

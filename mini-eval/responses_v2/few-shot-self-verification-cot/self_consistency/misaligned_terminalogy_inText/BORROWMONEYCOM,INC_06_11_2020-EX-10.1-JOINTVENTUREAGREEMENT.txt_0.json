        "explanation": "This statement presents a direct contradiction. It states that the business name will be 'BM&V2GO,' but then immediately contradicts itself by saying the 'partnership name will be Vaccines2Go.' A single entity cannot have two distinct names used interchangeably; this creates confusion and ambiguity regarding the venture's legal identity and how it should be referred to in contracts and other legal documents.",

        "explanation": "This entry is ambiguous and potentially contradictory.  It's unclear whether the '$60,000.00 USD From Monthly Government, City And State, And Or Private Awarded Contracts' is a fixed contribution, a funding source for the venture, or something else entirely.  The phrase 'Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue From Awarded Contract, In Addition to The Total Contributions' adds to the confusion. Is the 10% taken from the $60,000, or in addition to it, or related to a different contribution entirely?  The statement lacks clarity and potentially creates a conflict in how JVLS, LLC's contribution is defined.",

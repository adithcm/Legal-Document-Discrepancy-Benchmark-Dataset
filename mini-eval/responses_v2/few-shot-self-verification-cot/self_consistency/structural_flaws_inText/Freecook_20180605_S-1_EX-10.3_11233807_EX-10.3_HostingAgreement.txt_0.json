        "explanation": "This clause presents an inconsistency in text. It states that the company guarantees due dates regardless of the client's contribution. This is contradictory and unreasonable, as project timelines are inherently dependent on the timely delivery of materials, documentation, and approvals from the client. It's illogical to hold the company accountable for delays caused by the client's inaction or lateness.",

However, the Client can pay the remaining amount at any time, or in multiple installments, before the Scope of Work completion.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction in text. It first states that the remaining $3,100 is due on completion of the scope of work. Then, it immediately contradicts itself by allowing the client to pay the remaining amount at any time or in multiple installments *before* the scope of work is completed. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual payment schedule and the client's obligation.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a direct contradiction in text. The first sentence asserts that the company *must* continue providing customer service and *cannot* alter or cease it. The very next sentence states that the company *may* alter or cease providing customer service at any time, at its sole discretion, without any liability. This creates a clear and irreconcilable conflict regarding the company's obligations to provide customer service.",

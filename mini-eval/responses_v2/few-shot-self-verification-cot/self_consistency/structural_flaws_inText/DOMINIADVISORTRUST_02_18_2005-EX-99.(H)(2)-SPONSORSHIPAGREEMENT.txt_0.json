        "section": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party. However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a clear contradiction. The first sentence states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty'. However, the very next sentence immediately contradicts this by stating that 'termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.' This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the actual termination terms and whether penalties apply.",

Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit Domini's liability for subcontractors. However, the statement 'Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services' creates a potential legal contradiction. If Domini delegates a task to a subcontractor that is inherently part of Domini's obligations under the Sponsorship Agreement, Domini cannot simply disclaim responsibility because the subcontractor acted outside a narrowly defined scope of work within the subcontract. Basic contract law holds the delegating party (Domini) responsible for ensuring the delegated task, related to the core contract, is performed correctly. This attempt to sidestep that responsibility creates a legally questionable situation.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation.",
        "explanation": "The term 'subject to renegotiation' is ambiguous. This lack of clarity introduces uncertainty about the compensation structure if Domini serves for only part of a period. It doesn't specify the method, parameters, or even obligation for renegotiation, leading to potential disputes. Because the term 'subject to renegotiation' is used here in a legal document but is extremely vague, the language introduces potential difficulties in enforcing a consistent interpretation in accordance with applicable state or national law.",

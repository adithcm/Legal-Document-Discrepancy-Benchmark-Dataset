        "explanation": "The contract specifies a start date (September 1, 2004) but leaves both the total duration and the precise termination date undefined, using redacted information. This makes it impossible to determine the agreement's end date based on the provided text, creating a fundamental ambiguity about the contract's active period.",

This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "This definition severely restricts the scope of the endorsement.  It limits Adams Golf's rights to *only* use Tom Watson's name in marketing materials, excluding his likeness, voice, etc. This contradicts the \"ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT\" title and the WHEREAS clause, which states ADAMS GOLF desires to obtain the right to use the name, likeness, and ENDORSEMENT. It introduces an immediate inconsistency in what Adams Golf receives for consideration.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his sole discretion, use any golf clubs he desires, including those from competitors. He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section presents conflicting statements. First, it grants Consultant discretion to use any clubs, including competitors'. Then, it states he is 'encouraged' to use Mandatory Products. Finally, it acknowledges he may use clubs (including a putter) from other manufacturers *and endorse them*. This contradicts the Mandatory Product requirement and blurs the line between encouragement and a binding obligation.",

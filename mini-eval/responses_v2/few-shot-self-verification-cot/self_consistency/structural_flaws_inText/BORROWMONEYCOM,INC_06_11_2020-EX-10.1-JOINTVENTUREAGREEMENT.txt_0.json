        "section": "The exclusive purpose of the Venture (the \"Purpose\") will be IT Development. internet Back office Maintenance And Deployment of medical Service. This purpose may be changed at any time at the discretion of BorrowMoney.com, inc.",
        "explanation": "The initial statement defines the venture's purpose as IT development and back-office maintenance for medical services. However, the subsequent sentence grants BorrowMoney.com, inc. unilateral discretion to change this purpose at any time. This creates an in-text contradiction, because it first defines the purpose as specific and exclusive, but immediately introduces a clause that allows it to be altered without the consent of JVLS, LLC. This makes the initially defined purpose essentially meaningless and potentially misleading for JVLS, LLC, as the venture could be steered in an entirely different direction without their agreement.",

        "explanation": "The listed duties create an inconsistency. BorrowMoney.com is responsible for HTML, building and all deployment including a database. There is no statement of who is responsible for any of the medical service. The duties of JVLS, LLC are restricted to providing money. It is unlikely that it is intended that BorrowMoney.com is meant to provide medical services, and therefore this duty is missing.",

        "explanation": "These sections create a significant contradiction and structural flaw regarding the governance of the joint venture. Section 28 states that BorrowMoney.com, inc.'s vote carries twice the weight of JVLS, LLC's vote. Then, Section 29 allows BorrowMoney.com, inc. to amend the entire agreement without the consent of JVLS, LLC. This effectively nullifies any voting power that JVLS, LLC may have because even if JVLS, LLC votes against something, BorrowMoney.com can force through any ammendment. This also affects the structural integrity, because it implies that JVLS, LLC has very little decision making ability.",

        "section": "The duration of this Venture (the \"Term\") will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025, unless terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the Managers.",
        "explanation": "This section defines the term of the joint venture as starting on March 1, 2020, and ending on February 28, 2025. It also provides a mechanism for early termination by mutual agreement of the *Managers*.  However, the definition of 'Managers' in Section 7 refers to specific individuals (Aldo Piscitello and Jody Stewart), not necessarily all Members. This creates a potential contradiction: While section 5 states that the term may be extended with the unanimous consent of all Members, Section 4 only refers to the Managers. Early termination will only occur with the consent of the Managers. What if all Members agree to continue the venture, but the managers disagree?",

        "section": "The Managers will jointly decide major issues concerning the Venture. Where Managers are unable to reach agreement in deciding major issues, approval by a majority vote of the Managers will be required.",
        "explanation": "This section stipulates that managers must jointly decide major issues, but then allows for a majority vote if they can't agree. Given that there are only *two* managers specified in Section 7, a 'majority vote' doesn't really change the initial problem of disagreement. It is ambiguous since only one of them would need to agree in order for there to be a 'majority vote', which defeats the purpose of managers needing to jointly decide major issues.",

        "explanation": "The clause states Capital Contributions may be amended by decision of the Managers. If Members' interests are affected, additional capital contributions must have the unanimous consent of the Managers. This creates a contradiction because in the first sentence, the capital contributions may be amended by decision of the mangers, even if members' interest are affected. In the second sentence, if members' interest are affected, there must be unanimous consent of the managers. Which rule applies if members' interests are affected?",

        "explanation": "The redacted sections within the Term of Contract clause create a significant ambiguity.  The lack of specific values for the number of years, months, and the exact termination date makes it impossible to definitively determine the contract's duration. This is an in-text contradiction because without knowing the intended end date, other obligations and clauses tied to the 'term' of the agreement become unenforceable or open to multiple interpretations. For example, performance bonuses tied to the 'year-end' become problematic without a defined 'year'.",

        "section": "MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" shall mean the following ADAMS GOLF PRODUCTS that CONSULTANT must exclusively play/use in all Champions/Senior Professional Golf Association (SPGA) and Professional Golf Association (PGA) events at all times: [***** ] Confidential Material redacted and filed separately with the Commission. 2 1.[*****] 2.Sufficient [*****] to maintain total minimum of [*****] ADAMS GOLF [*****] (includes [*****])[*****] at all times 3.[*****] 4.[*****] (CONSULTANT may continue to place the [*****] logo on the [*****] consistent with historical practice.)",
        "explanation": "The extensive redactions within the definition of \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" introduce a critical ambiguity. While the clause states the consultant must exclusively use certain Adams Golf products, the specific products themselves are redacted. This leads to an in-text contradiction.  Section 5 states Consultant shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, but since the MANDATORY PRODUCT is not defined, Section 5 is therefore unenforceable. The clause allowing Consultant to continue placing the [*****] logo further complicates matters. Because the item that this references is redacted, this adds further ambiguity in knowing what products the consultant must actually use.  This impacts the entire contract because it creates confusion and conflicting interpretations on what 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS' really means. The contract provides rights and expectations, but the inability to identify such products creates an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This clause contains an internal contradiction. It initially states the CONSULTANT *shall* exclusively use MANDATORY PRODUCT. However, it immediately provides an exception, allowing the consultant to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction, only requiring a 'good faith effort' to use ADAMS GOLF products. This creates ambiguity regarding the extent of the exclusivity obligation. Is the 'good faith effort' a genuine requirement, or does the unlimited use of other manufacturer's equipment negate the original exclusive use provision?  This ambiguity undermines the very definition of 'exclusive' and sets up conflicting obligations, which is an in-text contradiction.",

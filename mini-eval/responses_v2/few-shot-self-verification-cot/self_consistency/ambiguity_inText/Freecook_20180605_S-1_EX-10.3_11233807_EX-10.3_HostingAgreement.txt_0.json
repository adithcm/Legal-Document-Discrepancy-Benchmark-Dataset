        "explanation": "This statement is inherently contradictory and creates ambiguity. While the contract states that due dates are 'not subject to any delay,' real-world projects are often affected by unforeseen circumstances (e.g., illness, technology failures, Client-side delays in providing content). The absolute prohibition of delays creates an unrealistic and likely unenforceable condition. This creates ambiguity and makes the term internally inconsistent.",

This appears straightforward but the language 'on completion of the Scope of Work' creates ambiguity. It does not specify *when* upon completion. This could be interpreted to mean immediately upon completion, or within a reasonable time after completion. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes over the exact timing of the final payment.",

However, the same sentence allows them to unilaterally cease providing it 'at any time' without liability. If customer service is part of the contracted services, then removing it completely contradicts the agreement. This makes the clause internally inconsistent.",

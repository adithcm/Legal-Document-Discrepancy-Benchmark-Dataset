        "explanation": "The contract specifies that the Client will pay a 'reasonable sum', this is too vague and undefined. There is no clear method provided to determine what constitutes a 'reasonable sum', leading to multiple possible interpretations and disputes. The Contract Price section in the following section states that the total is $5,000. This is not a 'reasonable sum', rather an 'exact amount', which contradicts the original statement.",

        "explanation": "The text says that the project is from 'February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018' and that it will take 12 weeks. However, February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018 is actually 11 weeks and 5 days, which means there is an incoherence between what the text says and the real time.",

The surcharge for rush work may be different from the standard hourly rate.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that a client may be asked to pay a surcharge for a rush deadline request, but there is no mention of what the standard hourly rate is. This creates a contradiction of terms, as a client does not know what a 'different' rate is without knowing the original.",

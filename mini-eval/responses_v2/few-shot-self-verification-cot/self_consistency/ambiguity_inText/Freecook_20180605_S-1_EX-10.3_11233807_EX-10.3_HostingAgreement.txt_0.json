        "explanation": "This statement creates a contradiction with the concept of 'Change Orders' outlined in section 1(a). Change Orders, by their nature, can potentially impact project timelines and lead to delays. If a Change Order is approved that requires significant additional work, it's logically inconsistent to maintain that the original due dates are still unchangeable. This absolute clause removes flexibility for addressing necessary adjustments due to agreed-upon scope modifications.",

Any email or telephone correspondence received after normal business hours will be processed the following business day. Client may be asked to pay an additional surcharge for any services requiring work to be performed outside of normal business hours by reason of a rush deadline requested by Client or as a result of Client's failure to meet scheduled times for delivery and/or review and approval of information, content and materials.",
        "explanation": "There is a structural flaw in the section. The description of the company's customer support services does not specify how customer issues will be handled and what is being surcharged. This means that any additional surcharge for work is very vague and unclear and can lead to more ambiguities in the contract.",

Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the obligation to provide customer service. It starts by stating that the company *shall* provide customer service. However, it later states that the company is *not obligated* to provide any customer service except as specified. Further, it states that customer services can be altered or ceased at any time. This creates a contradiction because it first implies a mandatory service and then negates that obligation, leaving the client uncertain about the level and consistency of support they will receive.",

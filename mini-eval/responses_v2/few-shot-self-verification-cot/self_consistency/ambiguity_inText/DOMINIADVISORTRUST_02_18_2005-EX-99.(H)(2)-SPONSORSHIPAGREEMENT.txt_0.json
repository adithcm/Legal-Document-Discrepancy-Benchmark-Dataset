        "section": "4. Limitation of Liability of the Sponsor. The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to define the Sponsor's liability. However, it contradicts itself. It starts by stating the Sponsor shall be 'fully liable for *any* error of judgment or mistake of law.' It then qualifies this with the phrase 'even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.' The inclusion of 'even without...' implies that the Sponsor *would* be liable if there *was* willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard. This essentially means they're liable for *any* mistake. However, the 'without' wording creates a structural flaw where the original statement is negated. It is contradictory to be liable without negligence.",

This Agreement shall become effective as of the day and year first above written and shall govern the relations between the parties hereto thereafter, unless terminated as set forth in this Section 6. This Agreement may not be altered or amended, except by an instrument in writing and executed by both parties. This Agreement may be terminated at any time, with the payment of a penalty equal to one year of the average management fees collected over the prior three years, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.",
        "explanation": "This section details the termination terms, including a penalty for early termination. The contradiction stems from the statement 'This Agreement may be terminated at any time...' followed by '...on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.' While 'at any time' implies immediacy and freedom from constraints, the subsequent clause introduces a 60-day notice period, thereby restricting the 'any time' termination clause. The immediate termination is in conflict with the 60 day termination.",

Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This clause contains a contradiction regarding the liability of Domini for the actions of its subcontractors. The text initially states that 'Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor.' However, it then qualifies this by adding 'but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.' This implies that Domini *is* responsible for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors, but *only* if those acts or omissions constitute gross negligence. The initial statement denying full responsibility is undermined by the subsequent condition, creating an inconsistency and ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "This statement contains an internal inconsistency. It promises 24/7/365 operation, but then allows for unscheduled maintenance without prior notice. This contradicts the continuous uptime guarantee because maintenance inherently involves downtime, and the lack of notice makes it difficult for the customer to plan around it. While some maintenance is expected, the lack of a defined process or reasonable notice period undermines the 24/7 promise.",

        "section": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends.",
        "explanation": "The clause states continuous operation (24/7) but allows for maintenance. This creates a potential ambiguity. The 24/7 commitment suggests uninterrupted service, but the maintenance clause introduces exceptions, potentially leading to disputes about what constitutes 'reasonable' maintenance and how it affects uptime guarantees. The clause doesn't quantify acceptable downtime for maintenance.",

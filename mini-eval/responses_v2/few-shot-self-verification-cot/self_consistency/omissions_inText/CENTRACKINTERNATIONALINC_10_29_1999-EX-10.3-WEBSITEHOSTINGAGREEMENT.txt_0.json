        "explanation": "The contract mentions a separate SLA that outlines connectivity details. However, without incorporating the SLA into this agreement, the actual service level commitment is unclear, leading to ambiguity. The statement that i-on is only required to provide limited services is contradictory and gives the impression that the services are unlimited.",

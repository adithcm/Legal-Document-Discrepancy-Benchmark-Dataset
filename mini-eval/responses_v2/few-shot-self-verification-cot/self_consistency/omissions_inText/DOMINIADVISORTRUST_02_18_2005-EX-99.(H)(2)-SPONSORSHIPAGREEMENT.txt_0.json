        "section": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This clause states that the Sponsor is not responsible for the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice. However, Section 1 states that 'Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust.' The term 'management services' in Section 1 is broad enough to potentially encompass some level of asset management or investment advice, thus creating a potential conflict with the explicit disclaimer in this section. It is unclear to what extent 'management services' extend and where the boundary lies with the disclaimer.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section dictates that the fee to be paid to Domini is 'a mutually agreed upon fee.' There is no indication of how the agreed-upon fee will be determined. There is no method listed to determine the agreement. This could cause issues in the future.",

        "explanation": "The term 'reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder' is ambiguous and could lead to disputes. While it aims to define a standard of conduct for liability, its subjective nature makes it open to different interpretations. It's not clear when simple negligence escalates to reckless disregard, potentially making it difficult to determine liability in practice. A better defined term would better suit the issue.",

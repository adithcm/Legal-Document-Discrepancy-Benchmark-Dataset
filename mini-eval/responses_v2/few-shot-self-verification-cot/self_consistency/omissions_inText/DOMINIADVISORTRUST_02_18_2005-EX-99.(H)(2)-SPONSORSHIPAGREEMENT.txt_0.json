        "section": "1. Duties of the Sponsor. Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The first part of this section says that the Sponsor 'shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust.' However, the following sentences negate this obligation by stating that the Sponsor 'shall not be responsible for the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice.' This creates an ambiguity because oversight, administration, and management services could reasonably be interpreted to include some level of asset management or investment advice. It's unclear what specific duties the Sponsor is actually obligated to perform.",

Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement' creates a contradiction. It says that the Trust will pay for the fees due to the sponsor, but section 3 states 'For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a mutually agreed upon fee', implying that this is the fee for all services provided, but Section 2 is for all operating expenses, which implies there are further payments that need to be made in addition to the mutually agreed upon fee.",

The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder. As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit the liability of the Sponsor for its actions. However, the language 'except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder' weakens the protection offered. While generally permissible, the level of protection might be deemed inadequate under certain state laws or regulations governing investment companies, specifically regarding the duties owed to the Trust and its shareholders.",

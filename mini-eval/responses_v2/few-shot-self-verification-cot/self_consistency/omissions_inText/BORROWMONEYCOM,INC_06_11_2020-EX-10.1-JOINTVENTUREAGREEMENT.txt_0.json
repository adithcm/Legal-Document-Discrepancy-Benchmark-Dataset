        "section": "The Purpose of the Venture will be determined by the Managers.",
        "explanation": "This clause is structurally flawed because it delegates the fundamental 'Purpose of the Venture' to the Managers without any guiding principles or limitations. The purpose is a foundational element that should be defined by the members, establishing clear constraints for what actions the managers may legally perform. Its absense is an error because the actions are not defined. Leaving the purpose entirely open-ended grants the managers excessive discretion and creates uncertainty regarding the scope of the venture's activities, leading to potential disputes and a high risk of actions inconsistent with the Members' intent.",

        "explanation": "This clause creates a significant risk of unfair valuation of a withdrawing member's interest. By allowing the remaining members to unilaterally determine the value of the venture 'in a manner deemed appropriate' and the withdrawing member's interest 'at their discretion,' the clause lacks objectivity and fairness. This could enable the remaining members to undervalue the withdrawing member's stake, leading to inequitable outcomes and potential legal challenges. Such a provision fails to provide a clear and impartial method for valuation, making it highly susceptible to abuse.",

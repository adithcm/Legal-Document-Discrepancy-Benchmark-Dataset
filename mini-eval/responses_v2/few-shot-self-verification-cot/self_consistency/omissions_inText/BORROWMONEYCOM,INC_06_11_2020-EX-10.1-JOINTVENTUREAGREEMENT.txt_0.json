        "section": "10. Within the limits of the Purpose of the Venture and the terms of this Agreement, the Managers, acting jointly, will have full authority to bind the Members in all matters relating to the direction, control and management of the Venture. Conduct and actions of the Managers will be dictated by policy and procedure established by the Members. Authority to bind the Venture in contract or in any third party business relation lies exclusively with the Managers, acting jointly.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence grants the managers full authority. However, the second sentence states that the 'conduct and actions of the Managers will be dictated by policy and procedure established by the Members.' This contradicts the first sentence, since the Members are dictating what the Managers actions are. The third sentence re-iterates what was stated in the first sentence, which makes this section contain 2 separate thoughts that are also opposing.",

        "explanation": "Inconsistent terminology. The term Contribution is never specifically defined, only Capital Contribution is defined. Therefore, 'Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue From Awarded Contract, In Addition to The Total Contributions.' is using 'Contribution' without the modifier 'Capital', therefore it is unknown what this refers to and is interchangeable.",

However, in the second part it states that a withdrawing Member's interest will be determined at the discretion of the remaining members. The word 'appropriate' and 'discretion' are used interchangeably, however, 'discretion' means the freedom to decide what should be done in a particular situation. This would imply that any other party does not have the opportunity to have a say in what should be done in a particular situation.",

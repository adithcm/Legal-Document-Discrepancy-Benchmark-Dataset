Client agrees to pay to Company to design and develop a website for Client (the \"Client Website\") in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. (a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work. (b) Due Dates and Delays. Company will use its best efforts to deliver the Client Website in the time frame specified in the Scope of Work. Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",
        "explanation": "Section 1(b) states the project timeline as 12 weeks from February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018. However, Section 1(a) says that any changes to the Scope of Work will cause delays, which contradicts section 1(b), which states that the Company will use its best effort to deliver the Client Website in the time frame specified in the Scope of Work. Any such changes could delay the due date which goes against what the company will try to deliver.",

        "explanation": "The payment terms in Section 2 outline a prepayment of $1,900 and a final payment of $3,100 upon completion of the Scope of Work, totaling $5,000. This section establishes a clear financial obligation for the Client, contingent upon specific milestones (prepayment and completion). There is no mention of how to address early termination, which goes against general provisions for business agreements.",

It states that the client will pay an additional surcharge for any work outside normal hours if it is due to the Client's action.

        "section": "B.\"PRODUCT\" shall mean all golf clubs including, but not limited to, metal woods, drivers, fairway woods, irons and putters.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"PRODUCT\" is broad, encompassing all golf clubs. However, section 4 introduces restrictions on Consultant endorsing or using products from other manufacturers or sellers of \"PRODUCT\". This conflicts with section 4D, which allows the Consultant to endorse and play the [*****]. This creates an ambiguity because, under the definition of \"PRODUCT\", the [*****] would also qualify as PRODUCT. This is a misaligned terminology. Section 4D attempts to create an exception, but without more precise language, it is not clear if [*****] is excluded from the initial definition of PRODUCT.",

        "section": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT.",
        "explanation": "This clause stating exclusive use of Mandatory Products seems straightforward but then it is contradicted by section 7 regarding consultant's satisfaction of mandatory products. In that section consultant has the option to refuse to use Mandatory Products if he does not like them. This clashes with this section. Section 7 effectively creates a condition under which the exclusivity requirement in section 5 can be voided based on the Consultant's subjective judgment and Adams Golf's inability to provide suitable replacements.",

        "section": "It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the MANDATORY PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement.",
        "explanation": "While this section provides a mechanism for the Consultant to express dissatisfaction with the Mandatory Product, it gives Adams Golf the sole discretion to either provide acceptable replacements or terminate the agreement. This creates a structural flaw, as it does not explicitly outline the consequences if Adams Golf fails to supply acceptable replacements and does not terminate the agreement. The text does not clearly describe the course of action, there by leading to an unresolvable issue.",

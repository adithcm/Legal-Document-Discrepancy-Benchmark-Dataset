        "explanation": "This section specifies the term of the contract but contains critical omissions. The number of years and months, as well as the specific termination date, are redacted, creating a fundamental ambiguity. Without these details, the actual duration of the agreement is unknown, rendering the contract's term unenforceable. The lack of a defined term creates a contradiction since the contract proceeds to define obligations and compensation based on an unspecified time period.",

The redacted information makes it impossible to determine which ADAMS GOLF products are mandatory, undermining the consultant's obligation to exclusively use them. Further, the redacted quantities and specifications of the products create additional ambiguity, making this obligation unenforceable. The listed items 1 through 4 all have missing components which are important to this agreement.",

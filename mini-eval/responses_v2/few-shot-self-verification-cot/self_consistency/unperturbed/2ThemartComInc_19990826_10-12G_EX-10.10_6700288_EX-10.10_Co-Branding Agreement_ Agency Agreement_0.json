        "section": "8.1 TERM.  The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the renewal of the agreement. It first states that the agreement may be renewed by mutual written agreement. However, it then states that if neither party provides notice of non-renewal, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates an ambiguity: does the agreement require explicit mutual agreement to renew, or does it automatically renew unless one party objects? This could lead to disputes if one party believes the agreement has renewed automatically while the other party believes it has expired due to lack of explicit agreement.",

        "explanation": "There is a misalignment issue with the terminology used here. While it is understood that the domain name is included as a trademark, the sentence uses trademark in a way that does not make sense. It can be interpretted as i-Escrow grantign 2TheMart a right to use a domain name that already exists.",

Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference.  However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This clause is contradictory. It states that a party is excused from performance due to a force majeure event. However, it also states that the occurrence of a force majeure event does not limit obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification). This means that even if a party's performance is prevented by a force majeure event, they are still liable for indemnification claims arising from that event. This seems contradictory - a party should not be held liable for something they were unable to prevent or perform due to circumstances beyond their control.",

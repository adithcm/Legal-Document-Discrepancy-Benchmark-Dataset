        "section": "1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. Notwithstanding the contents of the Exhibit, Provider agrees to respond in good faith to any reasonable request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, at a price to be agreed upon after good faith negotiations between the Parties. Any such additional services and resources so provided by Provider shall constitute Services under this Agreement and be subject in all respect to the provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on the Exhibit as of the date hereof.",
        "explanation": "The section states that the Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on Exhibit A. However, it also states that Provider agrees to respond to requests for additional services *not* in Exhibit A. While it requires 'good faith negotiations' on price, it effectively allows the Recipient to demand services outside the scope of the original agreement, potentially obligating Provider to deliver services not initially agreed upon. This introduces an ambiguity. The initial section defined the scope of services to what's in Exhibit A, but later it included any other service the Recipient reasonably requests. This creates potential for dispute regarding the scope of services and price negotiations as it could be argued that the request should be according to the original document (EXHIBIT A).",

(c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This section describes the Provider Representatives. The first sentence says their information 'shall be set out in Exhibit A'. However, it then states 'Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without prior consent of the Recipient'. There is a contradiction: If the names are listed in Exhibit A, then the Provider cannot change what's already in Exhibit A, rendering the Recipient consent requirement redundant or ambiguous. This is because Exhibit A itself cannot be unilaterally changed by Provider. This implies conflicting mechanisms for changes to the 'Provider Representatives'.",

But in section 3.2, it states that: Each of the Recipient and the Provider may, in their sole discretion, terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time without cause, and without liability except, in the case of the Recipient, for required payment for services rendered and reimbursement for authorized expenses incurred, by providing at least 90 (ninety) days' prior written notice to the other party (such date, the \"Services Termination Date\"). It is a contradiction to say that this agreement terminates on Decemeber 31, 2020, but can be terminated at any time.",

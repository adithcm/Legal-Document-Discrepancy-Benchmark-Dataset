        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows: The agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year: 1. Year 1. $[*****] 2. Year 2 $[*****] 3. Year 3 $[*****] 4. Year 4 $[*****] 5. Year 5 $[*****] B.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within three months following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than March 31, 2006. C.In the event that CONSULTANT is prevented from competing for reasons outside his control, the parties agree to a good faith attempt to resolve the issues. If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "Paragraph 8A establishes a minimum number of tournaments the Consultant must play and a repayment schedule if that minimum isn't met. Paragraph 8C, however, introduces a contingency where the Consultant is prevented from competing due to reasons outside his control. It states that the parties will attempt to resolve the issue in good faith. However, if no resolution is reached, ADAMS GOLF has the *sole discretion* to demand prorated repayment.  This contradicts the initial requirement for repayment based solely on the number of tournaments played.  The \"good faith attempt to resolve\" is undermined by ADAMS GOLF's unilateral right to demand repayment, effectively negating the protection intended for the Consultant in circumstances beyond his control. This makes the applicability of the repayment clause ambiguous.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines the base compensation, its amount, and the payment schedule ('upon completion of each calendar year').  However, it doesn't specify *when* within that year the compensation will be paid. It states 'upon completion', but does not give an actual due date. This lack of specificity can lead to disputes regarding when payment is considered late. In absence of a date, it defaults to a reasonable time frame, but 'reasonable' is subjective and can be challenged.",

The text states the other party may terminate for cause upon giving 'fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause and provided the breach is not rectified within such thirty (30) day period'. The notice given is 15 days, but the breach needs to be rectified within 30 days of the notice.

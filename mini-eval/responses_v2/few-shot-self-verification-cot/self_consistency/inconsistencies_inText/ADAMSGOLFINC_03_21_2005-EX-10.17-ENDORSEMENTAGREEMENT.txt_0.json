        "explanation": "The termination date is left undefined (redacted), but the contract commences September 1, 2004, for an undefined number of years and months. This makes it impossible to determine the actual contract length based on the written terms alone. Without a clearly defined termination date, the agreement's duration is ambiguous. The missing variables create an in-text contradiction because the contract states it has a term, but fails to specify it completely. This could lead to disputes.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity because it refers to a specific past advertising practice related to endorsing something. Due to redactions, it's impossible to ascertain the specifics of this advertising practice, how it relates to similarly situated professionals, or what constitutes a variation from that practice. This lack of clarity about the baseline agreement makes it difficult to enforce this paragraph. The redacted phrases introduce vagueness into the consultant's obligations, creating potential for disputes over compliance.",

        "explanation": "This section establishes that CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT but the section and wording contradicts clause 19, sections A,B, and C which reads that, 'In the event of ADAMS GOLF'S insolvency or bankruptcy, it is expressly agreed to by the parties that CONSULTANT shall not be obligated to repay any money so long as CONSULTANT continues to fully perform his obligations under this Agreement.'",

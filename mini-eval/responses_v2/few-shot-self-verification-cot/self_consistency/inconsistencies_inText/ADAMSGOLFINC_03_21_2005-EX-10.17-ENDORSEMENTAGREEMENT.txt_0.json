        "explanation": "This section has structural flaws because there are missing details about the term of this agreement. Specifically, the number of years and months are not specified, and the specific termination date is also missing. These omissions create uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the duration of the contract, rendering this section structurally unsound.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding paragraphs 4A, 4B and 4C above, CONSULTANT shall be entitled to endorse and play the [*****]. The parties expressly agree that CONSULTANT may permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If [*****] use of CONSULTANT varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "The text contains several omissions where bracketed asterisks '[*****]' appear, indicating that specific details regarding what the CONSULTANT is allowed to endorse, how his name/likeness can be used, the details of past advertising practices, and the actions to be taken if deviations occur are not defined. These omissions create significant ambiguity, particularly concerning the scope and limitations of the endorsement exceptions granted to the CONSULTANT. Without clear definitions, it is unclear what activities are permitted, potentially leading to disputes over compliance.",

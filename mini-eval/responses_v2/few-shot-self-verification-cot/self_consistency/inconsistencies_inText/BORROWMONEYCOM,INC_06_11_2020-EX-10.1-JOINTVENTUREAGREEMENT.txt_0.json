        "explanation": "The agreement states the execution date is \"Friday, March 2020\". March 20, 2020 was a Friday. But, the agreement is made and entered into 'this 20th day of Friday, March 2020', which is structurally flawed. Friday is not a day, it is part of the actual date and should be removed. This makes the sentence awkwardly worded and presents a structural flaw that does not make sense.",

        "explanation": "The sentence structure for this purpose clause is weak and structurally flawed. The use of mixed capitalization ('IT Development. internet Back office Maintenance And Deployment of medical Service.') and lack of clear grammatical structure makes the purpose vague and open to multiple interpretations. It's unclear if \"internet\" modifies all subsequent terms, or if they are separate purposes. The statement is poorly structured.",

The phrase \"Plus (10%) Of Any Generated Gross Revenue From Awarded Contract, In Addition to The Total Contributions\" is confusing and poorly worded. It's unclear *when* this 10% payment is due (is it ongoing, or a one-time payment related to the initial $60,000?), and how it relates to the \"Total Contributions\". The wording is misaligned and poorly structured.",

Assigning a $3,500,000.00 value to leased office space is highly suspect and lacks a clear, objective basis. Leased space does not translate to owned assets and should be specified properly.

        "explanation": "There are multiple structural flaws here, especially within the way the sections have been structured in conjunction with legal terms.

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Venture will be determined based on the total revenue generated over the last 3 months.

The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.",

It fails to account for profitability, assets, liabilities, future prospects, or any established business valuation principles.

        "explanation": "The phrase '20th day of Friday, March 2020' is structurally flawed. March 20, 2020, was a Friday, but the inclusion of both the ordinal '20th' and the day of the week 'Friday' is redundant and poor formatting, making the date declaration unconventional and slightly nonsensical. While it doesn't invalidate the agreement, it demonstrates a lack of attention to detail and could potentially be questioned in a dispute, as the structure is not proper and does not make sense in the context of legal documents.",

        "explanation": "The section describing the 'Purpose' of the venture, which outlines the business's objectives, contains structural flaws. 'IT Development. internet Back office Maintenance And Deployment of medical Service.' lacks proper sentence structure and grammar. The inconsistent capitalization (IT vs. internet), the missing articles (e.g., 'the internet'), and the overall lack of clear phrasing makes it difficult to understand the precise scope of the venture's activities. The lack of proper structuring of the purpose does not make sense and could lead to confusion over the obligations.",

Moreover, the different forms of contributions, office space versus cash and revenue sharing, are difficult to compare directly. This discrepancy in valuation and the ambiguity surrounding the revenue share create a contradiction as to the true capital contributions and their respective values.",

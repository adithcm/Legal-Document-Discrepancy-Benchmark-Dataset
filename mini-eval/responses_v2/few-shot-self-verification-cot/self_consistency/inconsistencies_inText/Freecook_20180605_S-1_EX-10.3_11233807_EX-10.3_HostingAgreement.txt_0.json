        "section": "However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",
        "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding the project deadline. The text states that the Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks and that delays will result in penalties. However, the text also states that the deadlines are subject to delay if the company does not receive the required materials on time from the client. This creates a situation where the company guarantees the deadline, however, also implies that the deadline is subject to change.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "The text contradicts itself. The text sets a surcharge for rush work that will be the standard hourly rate of $40 plus 25% or a flat fee of $100 per hour. The text says 'whichever is lower', however, $40 plus 25% is $50, which is lower than $100. This section should clarify which rate applies in which scenario to avoid ambiguity.",

Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.",
        "explanation": "This text presents conflicting information regarding the Company's obligation to provide customer service. Initially, it states that the Company 'shall provide customer service', implying a mandatory obligation. However, it then says that the Company 'is not obligated to provide any Customer Service except as specified in this Section'. This contradiction is further complicated by saying the Company may 'at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service'. The first statement sets a definite obligation, but the second statement provides an option to avoid it.",

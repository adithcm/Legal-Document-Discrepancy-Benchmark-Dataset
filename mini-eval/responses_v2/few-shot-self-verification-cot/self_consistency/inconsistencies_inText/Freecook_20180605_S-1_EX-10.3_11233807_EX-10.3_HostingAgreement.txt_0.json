Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",

The original text guarantees completion within 8 weeks with penalties for delays, but the added sentence states that due dates are subject to delay if the Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by the Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client, creating ambiguity on what happens if the Client is at fault.",

        "explanation": "The contract states that i-on will maintain the site continuously, 24/7, but then provides an exception for 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance'. This creates an ambiguity: the meaning of 'reasonable' is undefined, potentially leading to disputes about the duration and frequency of maintenance windows that interrupt the continuous service.",

        "explanation": "There's an ambiguity concerning the start date of payment responsibilities. The paragraph states that the customer is responsible for paying recurring monthly fees, however, this paragraph contains the expression 'beginning in April 1, 1999', while later in the contract, the paragraph TERM AND TERMINATION states that 'The term of this Agreement for the Hosted Site shall commence upon April 1, 1999'. The term 'commence upon' is ambiguous because it doesn't clearly state whether or not payment is expected upon April 1, 1999, or if payment is to begin sometime AFTER April 1, 1999.",

However, it also mentions that 'Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.'

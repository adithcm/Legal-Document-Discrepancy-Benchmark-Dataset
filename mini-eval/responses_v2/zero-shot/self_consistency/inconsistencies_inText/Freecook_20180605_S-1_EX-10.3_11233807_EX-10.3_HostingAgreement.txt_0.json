Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The text first states that the company will use its best efforts to deliver the website within 12 weeks, but then guarantees completion within 8 weeks. This creates a contradiction as to the actual timeframe for completion. It is unclear if the 12-week period is a soft estimate or if it is a valid timeframe with the 8-week guarantee being an accelerated option.",

        "explanation": "The payment terms are ambiguously described. It is not clear if the initial total payment of $5,000 includes the $1,900 prepayment or if the prepayment is separate. The text states the 'total' is $5,000 then describes the rest of the payment schedule as being an additional $3,100, which in total would be $6,900.",

        "explanation": "The calculation method for the rush work surcharge is unclear. The text indicates that either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus 25% will be used, or a flat fee of $100 per hour will be used. However, it is unclear what the standard hourly rate actually applies to and under what circumstances either amount is applied.",

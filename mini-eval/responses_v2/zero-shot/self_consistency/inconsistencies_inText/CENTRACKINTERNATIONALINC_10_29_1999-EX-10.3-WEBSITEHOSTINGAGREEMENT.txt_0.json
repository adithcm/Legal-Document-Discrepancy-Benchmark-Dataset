        "explanation": "The paragraph states that the recurring monthly fee is $450, but it fails to specify the currency. This omission creates ambiguity regarding the actual monetary value of the fee, potentially leading to disputes. It is necessary to specify the currency, such as USD, to avoid confusion.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'one (1) or more one (1) month periods' is ambiguous. It is unclear whether the agreement automatically renews for a single one-month period or for multiple consecutive one-month periods. This ambiguity can lead to disputes regarding the duration of the renewal term. The structural flaw of the text is that it has unnecessary words. Saying 'one (1) or more one (1) month periods' is essentially saying one or more months.",

        "explanation": "The term 'all amounts due' is ambiguous. It is unclear whether 'all amounts due' refers to the fees incurred up to the termination date or includes fees for the remaining term of the agreement, even if services are not provided. This ambiguity can lead to disputes about the customer's financial obligations upon termination. It is necessary to clarify whether the customer is liable for the entire contract amount or only for the services rendered until the termination date.",

        "explanation": "The second sentence specifies that the recurring monthly fees are due by the 20th of each month beginning April 1, 1999, however, the first sentence does not specify when the recurring monthly fee should be paid. This leads to a contradiction since the first sentence is more general.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"one (1) or more one (1) month periods\" is ambiguous. It is not clear how many one-month renewal periods the agreement can have, and creates an in-text contradiction, because it is not specific.",

        "explanation": "This section states that i-on will maintain the operation of the hosted site continuously, 24/7/365, but then immediately contradicts itself by stating that maintenance will be performed, which inherently interrupts the continuous operation. The phrase 'during any time of the day, including weekdays' is also ambigious. There is no specification as to how often maintenance will be performed, and the phrase suggests it could be excessive.",

The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The second sentence says that the customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 20th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The phrase 'April 1, 1999' should read 'May 20, 1999'. Since the contract was entered into on April 6, 1999, it would be impossible to make a payment before the contract was even signed.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence states that the term of the agreement is for six months. The second sentence indicates that the agreement will renew automatically for one month periods unless either party gives notice. The third sentence indicates that either party can terminate the agreement without cause with 30 days written notice. These 3 sentences do not align. If the agreement is for 6 months, how can either party give notice to terminate at any time? What happens if the customer gives notice 1 week before the 6 month term is up? Do they still have to pay for the full 6 months? The 30 days written notice contradicts the 6 month term length.",

        "explanation": "The description of BorrowMoney.com, Inc.'s duties is vague and lacks specificity. The term \"HTML code\" is overly broad, and the phrase \"medical dispatch personal & product service as needed\" is unclear. The sentence \"provided by three qualified assigned Borrowmoney.com, inc. employees/personal\" is grammatically incorrect and ambiguous regarding the exact responsibilities of those employees. This leads to potential disputes over the scope and quality of the services BorrowMoney.com, Inc. is obligated to provide.",

However, the phrasing \"In Addition to The Total Contributions\" is unclear, as the $60,000 is already listed as a contribution. This could be misinterpreted as requiring additional payments beyond the initial contribution and the revenue percentage, leading to disputes over the true financial obligations of JVLS, LLC.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"Includingspecified Description of duty*\" is grammatically incorrect and unclear in its meaning. It's uncertain whether the duty refers to the office space itself or the duties of BorrowMoney.com, Inc., leading to ambiguity. The asterisk suggests a footnote or additional information, but no corresponding footnote exists in the contract to clarify the duty. This ambiguity can result in disagreements about the scope of BorrowMoney.com, Inc.'s contribution and responsibilities.",

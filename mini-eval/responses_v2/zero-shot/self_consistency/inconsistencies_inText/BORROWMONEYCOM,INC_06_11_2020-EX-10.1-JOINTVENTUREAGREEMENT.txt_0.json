        "explanation": "The payment terms for JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go are ambiguous. It states they are to pay $60,000 within 90 days of signing the agreement, PLUS 10% of any generated gross revenue from awarded contracts, IN ADDITION to the total contributions.  It's unclear if the 10% is part of their initial contribution, a separate ongoing payment, or related to 'additional capital contributions' later in the agreement. This section is also contradictory, as it states the 10% is 'in addition to total contributions,' but never clearly defines if it is a one-time or ongoing payment. This creates an internal contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section is confusing and contains what appears to be misaligned information, creating an in-text contradiction.  The $3,500,000 valuation is assigned to BOTH BorrowMoney.com's contribution of office space AND JVLS, LLC's cash contribution PLUS the 10% of gross revenue. This is nonsensical, as it suggests both contributions are individually valued at the same amount. It is unlikely that $60,000 cash plus a percentage of revenue would be valued the same as 1,500 sqft of office space. This misaligns the terminology and valuation.",

An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members. A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.",
        "explanation": "The method for valuing a withdrawing member's interest contains a contradiction. The first sentence states the Venture's value will be based on the total revenue generated over the last 3 months.  However, the fourth sentence states a withdrawing member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account.  These are two different valuation methods, creating ambiguity and an in-text contradiction as to how a withdrawing member's interest will actually be calculated. It also creates an ambiguity for how the capital account is valued.",

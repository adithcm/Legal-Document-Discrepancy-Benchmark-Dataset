        "section": "The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The section states that legal counsel fees will be covered by Domini, and that all other operating expenses will be covered by the trust. This becomes an in-text contradiction because the definition of operating expenses includes accounting fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants. This means that Domini only needs to cover legal fees, while the trust covers all other auditor and accounting fees.",

        "explanation": "The section states that a penalty of $10,000 must be payed to terminate the agreement. This becomes an ambiguity in text because the agreement does not state when the penalty must be paid and to who it must be paid to. For example, does the trust pay the penalty to the sponsor, or does the sponsor pay the penalty to the trust?",

        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity and is a structural flaw in the text because it is poorly written. If Domini subcontracts for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations, then Domini is not responsible for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor. However, this does not mean that the trust is responsible, but rather that no one is responsible for the subcontactor. This does not make sense because the trust has no control over the subcontactor, and Domini is not liable either.",

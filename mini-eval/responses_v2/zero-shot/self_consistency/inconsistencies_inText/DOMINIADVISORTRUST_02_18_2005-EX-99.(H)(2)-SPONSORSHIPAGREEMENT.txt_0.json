        "section": "Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the allocation of expenses between Domini and the Trust. However, it states that Domini covers legal counsel fees and the Trust covers operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor and compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor. This creates an ambiguity as to which expenses are the responsibility of each party.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"with the payment of a penalty of $10,000\" when the agreement can be terminated at \"any time\" with \"not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party\" creates an inconsistency. The statement implies that a party can terminate the agreement at any point, provided they give 60 days' notice, but also that a penalty applies to such termination. If this is the case, there needs to be more information regarding how and when the penalty applies.",

If a subcontractor's actions, due to negligence or willful misconduct, negatively impact the Trust, the clause could cause legal contradictions related to fulfilling their required duties.",

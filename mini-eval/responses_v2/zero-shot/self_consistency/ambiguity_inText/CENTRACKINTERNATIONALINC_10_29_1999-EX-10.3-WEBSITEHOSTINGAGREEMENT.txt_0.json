        "explanation": "The contract states that i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, 24/7, including holidays. However, it then immediately contradicts this by stating an exception for necessary hardware and software maintenance. This creates ambiguity because the phrase 'at its convenience, without prior notice' implies that i-on can schedule maintenance at any time and for any duration, potentially disrupting the continuous operation promised earlier. It is not clear how often this can happen and the duration. This can potentially lead to conflict between the two parties because i-on is not held liable if the website is down due to mantainance. ",

        "explanation": "This section outlines that i-on provides connectivity to the internet via a T1 line. However, the section immediately states that it will not be responsible for maintaining such connectivity with the phone company and the Internet backbone access provider. This is a contradiction because i-on is stating that they are providing connectivity but not responsible for maintaining this connectivity.",

The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner may result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "The language here is ambiguous regarding the consequences of late payment. While it states that failure to pay 'may' result in interruption or discontinuation of services, it doesn't explicitly state that i-on is obligated to take such action, nor does it specify any process or notification that i-on must follow before interrupting or discontinuing service. This ambiguity could lead to disputes if the Customer believes they have a grace period or if i-on interrupts service without warning.",

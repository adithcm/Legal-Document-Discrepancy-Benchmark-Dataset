        "explanation": "The discrepancy lies in the ambiguity surrounding the end date of the contract. The contract specifies a start date and a duration in years and months, but the termination date is left unspecified with redactions. This omission creates an in-text contradiction because it's impossible to determine the agreement's length or the obligations' timeline. The contract's term is undefined.",

        "explanation": "The definition of \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" is significantly redacted, rendering it impossible to understand exactly which ADAMS GOLF products the CONSULTANT is obligated to use exclusively. The redacted material removes key specifics. It creates a contradiction because the agreement emphasizes the exclusive use of MANDATORY PRODUCTS, but fails to clearly define them.",

        "explanation": "This section contains an in-text contradiction. It starts by stating that the CONSULTANT shall exclusively use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, but then immediately qualifies this by allowing the CONSULTANT to use equipment from any manufacturer. The requirement to make a \"good faith effort\" to use ADAMS GOLF products is vague and unenforceable, negating the exclusivity clause and creating conflicting obligations.",

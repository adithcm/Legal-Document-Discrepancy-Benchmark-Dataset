        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. This excludes use of likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is restricted to using the consultant's name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF and explicitly excludes the use of likeness or image for promotional events unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. This creates a contradiction because the essence of an endorsement often involves using likeness or image, especially in promotional events. By explicitly excluding these aspects, the definition severely limits the scope of the endorsement, potentially undermining the purpose of having an endorsement agreement in the first place.",

        "explanation": "This clause creates a contradiction because it states that the CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, but follows that by saying the CONSULTANT is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction. These two statements oppose each other and it is unclear what should be followed in this case.",

        "section": "B. During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his discretion, participate in television and radio commercials, photo shoots, modeling, and promotional appearances. ADAMS GOLF shall reimburse CONSULTANT for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances. Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation.",
        "explanation": "The contradiction arises from the combination of allowing participation at the consultant's discretion, yet specifying reimbursement only for special appearances for ADAMS GOLF. This creates ambiguity as to whether the consultant is entitled to reimbursement for travel expenses if they participate in promotional activities not specifically requested by Adams Golf, but are still related to the endorsement. For example, it's unclear if Adams Golf is responsible for travel expenses if the consultant is requested for a television interview regarding the product, but it was not requested by Adams Golf.",

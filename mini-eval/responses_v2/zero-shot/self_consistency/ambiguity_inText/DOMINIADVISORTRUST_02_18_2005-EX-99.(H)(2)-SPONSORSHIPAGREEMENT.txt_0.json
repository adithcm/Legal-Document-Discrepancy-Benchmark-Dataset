        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to make the Sponsor liable for *any* error of judgment or mistake of law, even absent bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard. This is highly unusual and contradicts standard legal principles, which generally require some level of culpability (negligence, recklessness, or intent) for liability to attach. It's unlikely a court would enforce such a broad liability standard, creating a legal contradiction. It is extremely difficult to prove a negative, so if it went to trial it would be difficult for the sponsor to prove it wasn't an error in judgement.",

        "explanation": "This section states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time' but also requires 'not less than 60 days' written notice.' This creates an in-text contradiction. If the agreement can be terminated at any time, there should be no minimum notice period.",

        "explanation": "This clause has a structural flaw and does not make sense. Usually the company/sponsor is responsible for its subcontractors, and only not responsible if there is gross negligence. This clause flips that and doesn't make sense.",

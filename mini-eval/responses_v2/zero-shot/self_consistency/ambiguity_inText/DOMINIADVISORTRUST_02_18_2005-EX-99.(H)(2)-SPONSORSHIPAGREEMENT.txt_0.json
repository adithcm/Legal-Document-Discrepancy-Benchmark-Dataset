        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding Domini's liability for subcontractors. It initially states that Domini is 'not fully responsible' for the acts of subcontractors, implying some level of responsibility. However, it then clarifies that Domini is only responsible in cases of 'gross negligence.' This creates ambiguity about the extent of Domini's liability for a subcontractor's actions that fall short of gross negligence but still cause harm to the Trust.",

Typically, a trustee or board has a duty to ensure that any delegated responsibilities are carried out by qualified individuals or entities. Removing the approval process for subcontractors who perform essential fund services is a contradiction of common practice.",

        "explanation": "This section imposes a very high standard of liability on the Sponsor, making it liable even for simple errors of judgment or mistakes of law, regardless of intent or negligence. This is unusual and potentially contradicts common law principles that generally require some level of fault (negligence, gross negligence, or willful misconduct) for liability to attach. The phrase 'even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder' creates a legal contradiction to general liability principles.",

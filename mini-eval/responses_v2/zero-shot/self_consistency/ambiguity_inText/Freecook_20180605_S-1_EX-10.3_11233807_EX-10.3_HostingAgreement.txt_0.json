        "explanation": "This statement is overly broad and potentially unenforceable. It's unreasonable to claim that *any* delay is unacceptable, regardless of the cause (e.g., unforeseen technical issues, illness, natural disasters). Such a strict interpretation could lead to legal disputes and may not hold up in court due to the doctrine of impossibility or frustration of purpose.",

        "explanation": "While it's reasonable to specify preferred formats, outright rejection of a common format like PDF is impractical and potentially impedes project progress. It doesn't clearly state *why* PDFs are unacceptable, making the requirement seem arbitrary. This section should specify that content within the PDF must be extracted and delivered in the specified formats. Not defining 'other manner' leaves this open to interpretation and potentially unnecessary disputes.",

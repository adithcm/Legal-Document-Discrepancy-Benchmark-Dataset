It is difficult to understand what exactly are the monetary obligations or responsibilities of JVLS, LLC. The Phrase also seems incomplete or grammatically unsound.",

This allows the remaining members to determine the value. The second sentence then states that a withdrawing Member's interest will be determined at the discretion of the remaining members. This is ambiguity in text, because the term value is not the same as interest. What will happen if the members decide to use value to determine the amount of interest.

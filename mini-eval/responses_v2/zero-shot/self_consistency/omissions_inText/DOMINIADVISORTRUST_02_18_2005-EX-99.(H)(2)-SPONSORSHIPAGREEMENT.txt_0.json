        "explanation": "This section states that Domini pays the salaries of the Trust's Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini's affairs. However, Section 2 then states \"The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement\". It is not clear if the fees paid to the sponsor also include the salaries of the Trustees and officers.",

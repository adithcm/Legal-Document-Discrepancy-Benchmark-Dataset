Later, it mentions repayment if the Consultant plays in less than a certain number of events, which is also redacted.

The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Upon termination due to the consultant's death or inability to play, the contract requires the consultant's estate to repay Adams Golf for the unperformed period, calculated as per paragraph 8A. This repayment obligation is contradictory, as paragraph 8A is related to failure to play in minimum number of tournaments. It doesn't make sense to apply the same repayment calculation to a situation of death or total inability to play.",

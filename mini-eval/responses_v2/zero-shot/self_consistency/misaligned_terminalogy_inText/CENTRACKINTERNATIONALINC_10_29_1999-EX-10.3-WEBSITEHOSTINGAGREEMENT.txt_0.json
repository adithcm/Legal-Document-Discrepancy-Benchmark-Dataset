        "section": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Web site\" shall mean a collection of interconnected webpages residing on the internet. A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites. The term \"Hosted Site\" shall mean the online portal of the Customer that is hosted by i-on under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'Web site' is broad and general, while the definition of 'Hosted Site' is specific to the Customer's online portal hosted by i-on. However, there's an ambiguity: the initial definition of 'Web site' states that multiple websites can exist on one server, including the 'Hosted Site'. This creates confusion because both terms could apply to the customer's online portal.",

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss.",

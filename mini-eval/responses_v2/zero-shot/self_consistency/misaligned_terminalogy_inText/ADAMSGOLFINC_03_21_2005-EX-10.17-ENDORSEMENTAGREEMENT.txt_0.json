This contradicts the general purpose of the agreement, which aims to use the consultant's endorsement for advertising and promotion of the product to the wider market. The definition limits the scope of the endorsement to internal use, conflicting with the 'WHEREAS' clause, where it states that ADAMS GOLF desires to use the endorsement of CONSULTANT in connection with the advertisement and promotion of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT.",

The phrase 'unless CONSULTANT acts in a manner that brings additional media attention to the ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT' contradicts the termination clause because it implies that certain behaviors are allowed that might violate the conditions in Section 12 parts A-D.",

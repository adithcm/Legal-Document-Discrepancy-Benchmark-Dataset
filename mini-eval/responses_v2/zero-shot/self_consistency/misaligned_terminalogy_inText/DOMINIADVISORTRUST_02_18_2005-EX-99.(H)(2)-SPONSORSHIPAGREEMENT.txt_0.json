        "explanation": "While this statement outlines the intent for Domini to provide services, section 1 states that 'Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor may perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust'. The word 'may' creates a discrepancy, because Domini may not provide oversight, administrative, and management services.",

        "explanation": "This section specifies Domini's duties include monitoring and coordinating the performance and billings of various agents. However, Section 1 goes on to say, 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.' This clause contradicts the previous statement by stating Domini has no responsibility for the functions assumed by transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "Section 1, subsection L states that the Sponsor answers questions from the general public, the media, and investors in the Trust. The following statement, 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall also be fully responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets including rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust,' uses the word 'Notwithstanding' to refer to the entirety of section 1, which includes 1L. This causes a contradiction because section 1L refers to answering questions to the public, media, and investors about securities holdings, investment limits, social investment philosophy, the proxy voting philosophy, and shareholder activism philosophy of the trust, none of which has to do with management of the Trust's assets. The inclusion of 1L in this statement is misaligned.",

        "explanation": "This section limits the liability of the Sponsor for errors, mistakes, acts, or omissions, except in cases of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of obligations. The definition of 'Sponsor' extends this limitation of liability to Domini, its affiliates, and their directors, officers, and employees. This is a discrepancy, because it's generally not legally accepted that a company's affiliates, directors, officers, and employees are not liable for errors, mistakes, acts, or omissions.",

        "explanation": "This agreement states that the contract may be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor'. A discrepancy exists because although the contract can be terminated 'at any time', it also must be terminated 'on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party'. The words 'at any time' implies the contract can be terminated right away, which is a direct contradiction to the 60 days' written notice.",

        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  <*$p$*>In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The text presents a contradiction regarding the renewal process. It initially states that renewal requires 'mutual written agreement,' indicating active consent from both parties. However, the added sentence stipulates an 'automatic renewal' if no notice is given, effectively nullifying the need for mutual agreement. This creates ambiguity about the actual renewal process and whether explicit consent is required.",

        "explanation": "There is a contradiction in the time frame provided for the approval of promotional materials. The first sentence states that a written request for approval should be submitted no less than three business days prior to the release date. However, the second sentence indicates that approval should be provided within one business day of receipt. These conflicting timelines make it impossible to comply with both requirements simultaneously, creating an internal inconsistency.",

        "section": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the  Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"Distributor\" is broad and includes Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party granted distribution rights by Siemens. This could create ambiguity if Siemens grants distribution rights to a Third Party that conflicts with Siemens' own obligations under the agreement, leading to potential disputes over who is responsible for specific duties.",

        "section": "2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase  Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor  and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a  Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both  the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that  the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines a specific procedure for a Quote or Purchase Order to supersede the master agreement, requiring signatures from specific high-level executives and explicit reference to the section. This creates an in-text contradiction because the standard process for amending a contract (detailed in Section 12.14) typically requires only a written agreement signed by duly authorized representatives, which can be broader than the CFO or General Counsel. This discrepancy leads to uncertainty about which amendment process takes precedence.",

For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor  and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as  determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months  prior to the expected shipment date.",
        "explanation": "This creates a contradiction because section 4.1.2 states, \"Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor.\" This contradicts section 3.6, which states that the Purchase Order should be sent six months prior to the expected shipment date.",

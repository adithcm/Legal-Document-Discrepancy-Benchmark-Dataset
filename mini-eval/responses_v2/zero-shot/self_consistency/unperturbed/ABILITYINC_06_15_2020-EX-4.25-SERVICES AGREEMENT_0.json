        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This clause restricts the Provider Representatives from offering services to other clients of the Provider. However, the Provider's compensation is determined by the actual costs incurred in providing the services, along with a 10% service fee. This may create a contradiction as limiting the Provider Representatives to solely providing service to the Recipient can potentially increase the costs, especially if their time isn't fully utilized, which the Recipient would ultimately bear, contradicting the intention of cost-based compensation.",

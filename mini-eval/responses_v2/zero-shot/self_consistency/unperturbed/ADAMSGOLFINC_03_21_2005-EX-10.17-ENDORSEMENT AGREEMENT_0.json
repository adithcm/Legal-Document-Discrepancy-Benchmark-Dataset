        "section": "The Term of this Agreement shall be for a period of [* ****] years and [*****] months commencing the 1st day of September 2004 and terminating the [*****] day of [*****].",
        "explanation": "The contract states that the term is for a specific number of years and months, but the exact duration (number of years, specific month and day of termination) is redacted. This omission creates ambiguity because it is impossible to definitively determine the contract's end date, leading to potential disputes over the duration of obligations and rights under the agreement. This means that the obligations and any deadlines are not clear.",

        "section": "Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement, in the event that CONSULTANT dies or is unable to play tour golf at all, ADAMS GOLF may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon such termination, CONSULTANT and/or CONSULTANT'S estate shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a contradiction. If the consultant dies or is completely unable to play tour golf, the contract can be terminated, but the consultant's estate is required to repay Adams Golf for the unperformed period. This creates an issue because it is difficult to claim payment for services that cannot be performed due to the consultant's death or total disability. This is an in-text contradiction.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that if either party materially breaches the agreement, the other party can terminate the agreement for cause after providing 15 days written notice. Upon termination, CONSULTANT is required to repay ADAMS GOLF for the unperformed period. It does not however, mention what ADAMS GOLF needs to pay CONSULTANT if ADAMS GOLF terminates the agreement. There is no equal balance in the agreement.",

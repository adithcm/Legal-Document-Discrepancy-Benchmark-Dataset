        "explanation": "The phrase 'except as provided for below' creates ambiguity. The document doesn't specify explicitly any provision where one Joint Venturer can act alone. The lack of clarity on where this exception is defined makes this contradictory.",

Further, each Party elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary, be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate documentation.",

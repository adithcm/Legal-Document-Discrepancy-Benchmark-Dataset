Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to limit Domini's liability for subcontractors' actions to the extent of the subcontractor's insurance coverage, and absolves Domini of responsibility for actions outside the contracted services. This may contradict general legal principles where a principal (Domini) can be held liable for the actions of its agents (subcontractors), especially if Domini had a duty to supervise or properly select the subcontractor. The limitation could be unenforceable if it conflicts with applicable state or federal laws regarding vicarious liability or negligence. It could be argued that Domini still has a duty to ensure subcontractors are competent and perform services within a reasonable standard of care.",

        "explanation": "This sentence introduces a penalty for the Sponsor if they terminate the agreement within the first year, which is equivalent to three months of the average management fee. There is no clear calculation method defining how 'average management fee' is determined which creates ambiguity within the sentence. Is it the projected average, a historical average, or some other calculation.",

        "explanation": "This clause attempts to limit the Sponsor's liability, but the language is broad and potentially contradictory. While it excludes liability for errors of judgment or mistakes of law, it includes liability for 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence'. These terms are not consistently defined, and their interpretation can be subjective and lead to arguments. For example, the distinction between an 'error of judgement' and 'gross negligence' can be blurry, potentially leading to disputes.",

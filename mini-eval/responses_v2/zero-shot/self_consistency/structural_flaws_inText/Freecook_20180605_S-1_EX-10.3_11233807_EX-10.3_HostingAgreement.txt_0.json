        "explanation": "This statement is illogical and creates an internal contradiction. It asserts that the Company guarantees due dates regardless of whether they receive necessary materials from the client. This is not possible. If the client delays providing materials, it will inherently affect the company's ability to meet the due dates. The sentence 'Delays will not affect the due dates' directly contradicts the reality of project development.",

        "explanation": "This section contains contradictory statements regarding the Customer Service. First, it states that the Company is obligated to continue providing Customer Service and may not alter or cease providing it. Then, it immediately contradicts itself by stating that the Company, at its sole discretion, may alter or cease providing Customer Service without any liability. This creates confusion about the company's obligations.",

The client can pay the remaining amount in full at any time, even in multiple installments. This does not make the initial statement valid.",

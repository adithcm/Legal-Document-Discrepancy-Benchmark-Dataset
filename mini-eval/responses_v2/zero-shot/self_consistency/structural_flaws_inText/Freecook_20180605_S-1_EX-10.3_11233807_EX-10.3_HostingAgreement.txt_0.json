Client acknowledges and agrees that all due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are guaranteed by the Company, regardless of whether the company receives required materials, documentation, or approvals in a timely fashion from the client. Delays will not affect the due dates.",
        "explanation": "This section creates an internal contradiction. The first sentence sets a project timeline, but the subsequent sentences state that all due dates are guaranteed by the Company, regardless of delays caused by the client. This is contradictory because it's impossible to guarantee due dates if the client doesn't provide the necessary materials on time. This makes the guaranteed due dates unenforceable.",

        "explanation": "This section creates an internal contradiction. The initial statement requires the remaining $3,100 to be paid 'on completion of the Scope of Work.' However, the added sentence then states that the client can pay the remaining amount at any time, or in multiple installments, before the Scope of Work completion. This creates ambiguity as to the actual deadline for the final installment.",

        "explanation": "This section contains an internal contradiction. The first sentence states that the Company is obligated to continue providing customer service and cannot alter or cease providing it. The second sentence then grants the Company the discretion to alter or cease providing customer service at any time without liability. These two statements directly contradict each other, creating uncertainty about the Company's actual obligations regarding customer service.",

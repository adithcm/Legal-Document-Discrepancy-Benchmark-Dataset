        "section": "CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"ENDORSEMENT\" is too restrictive. By explicitly excluding almost every conceivable aspect of a celebrity's persona except their name, the agreement effectively renders the endorsement nearly worthless. This severely limits Adams Golf's ability to effectively market products using Tom Watson's association. It is highly unusual to define an endorsement so narrowly.",

He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. <*$p$*> (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "The text enclosed between the tags creates a contradiction. The first sentence provides that the consultant is allowed to use any golf clubs, including the one from competitors. The sentence after states that they can endorse other clubs that are not ADAMS GOLF clubs. Section 4.A states that the consultant shall not give the right to use the consultant's name to any other seller of PRODUCT.",

The actual base compensation shall be determined annually based on Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion. No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.",
        "explanation": "This language regarding base compensation is contradictory. The first sentence suggests a potential base compensation, but the following sentences give ADAMS GOLF complete discretion over whether any compensation is actually paid. The statement that 'No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon' effectively makes the entire compensation clause non-binding, as ADAMS GOLF could simply refuse to agree to any compensation amount. This creates uncertainty and potentially renders the 'agreement' illusory with respect to compensation.",

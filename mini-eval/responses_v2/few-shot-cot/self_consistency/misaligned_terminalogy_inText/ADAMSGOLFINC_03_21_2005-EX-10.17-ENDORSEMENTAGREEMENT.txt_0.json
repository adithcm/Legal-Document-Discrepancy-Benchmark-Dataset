        "explanation": "The contract term is not clearly defined due to the redacted information.  The agreement states it starts September 1, 2004, and is for a certain number of years and months, but the exact end date is obscured by redactions. This creates ambiguity because the actual duration of the contract cannot be determined. This impacts obligations and rights that depend on the agreement's timeframe. This could lead to disputes about when the contract expires or when obligations cease.",

        "explanation": "The specifics of the 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS' that the Consultant must use are heavily redacted. This creates a significant ambiguity because the Consultant's obligation to exclusively use certain products is undefined.

This creates a material ambiguity because the financial implications of failing to meet the tournament minimum cannot be calculated.

        "explanation": "The statement that i-on will maintain operation continuously 24/7 including holidays directly contradicts the exception for 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance.' This creates ambiguity because it doesn't define 'reasonable,' leading to potential disputes over what constitutes acceptable downtime. It's unclear whether 'continuous' operation is truly guaranteed, or if i-on can take the site offline at any time under the guise of maintenance within the specified hours. The 'best efforts' clause is too vague, failing to provide concrete metrics or consequences for failing to meet the 24/7 uptime commitment. A clear definition of acceptable downtime or uptime percentage is needed to resolve this.",

The first part of the text states that The Customer is solely responsible for all customer support required by users of Hosted Site.

However, the first sentence says that Customer is responsible for all customer support, but the next couple of sentences states that i-on must communicate the resolution to the Customer, thereby giving customer support.

        "section": "The term of this Agreement for the Hosted Site shall commence upon April 1, 1999 and shall continue for a period of six (6) months, unless earlier terminated in accordance with provisions hereof. This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due to i-on and to make such payments on a timely basis.",
        "explanation": "The initial term is for six months, automatically renewing for one month periods unless notice is given 15 days prior. However, a separate clause states that either party can terminate the agreement 'without cause at any time' with 30 days' written notice. This creates a contradiction: if the agreement automatically renews, is the 30-day termination clause still applicable, or does the renewal period restrict immediate termination? If the agreement is terminated within a renewal period, it is not clear if the customer is liable for the full month's fee. The 'notwithstanding' clause reinforces the obligation to pay, but it's unclear what happens to fees paid beyond the termination date in such a scenario. This needs clarification regarding the interplay between the renewal and termination clauses to avoid disputes about the effective termination date and payment obligations.",

        "explanation": "While the contract specifies that the website design and development will be 'in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A,' the exhibit itself is very vague. The Scope of Work lists very broad objectives (e.g., 'Search Engine Optimization,' 'Development of unique style of the Client Website') without providing concrete deliverables, measurable criteria, or specific features. This lack of detailed specifications creates significant ambiguity regarding what constitutes 'design and development' under the contract, creating a potential for disputes. This ambiguity can be exploited.",

        "explanation": "The contradiction arises from the ambiguity surrounding the definition of 'completion of the Scope of Work.' As discussed earlier, the Scope of Work (Exhibit A) lacks specific deliverables and measurable milestones. This makes it subjective to determine when the Scope of Work is truly 'complete.' This ambiguity introduces risk for the Client, as the Service Provider could potentially claim completion even if the Client is not satisfied with the delivered work. The Client could find it difficult to argue that the work is incomplete without objective criteria defined in the Scope of Work.",

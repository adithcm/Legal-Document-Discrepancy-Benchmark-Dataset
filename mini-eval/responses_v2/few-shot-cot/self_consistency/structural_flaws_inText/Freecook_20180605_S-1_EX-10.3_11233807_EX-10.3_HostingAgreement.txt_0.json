        "explanation": "This section states that due dates are guaranteed by the Company regardless of whether the company receives required materials from the client, therefore delays will not affect the due dates. This is contradictory because the company cannot guarantee the due dates if the client does not provide required materials. It is impossible for the company to guarantee due dates if it is waiting on the client to send necessary documents.",

        "explanation": "This statement is structurally flawed and contradictory. It states that the due dates in the scope of work are guaranteed by the Company REGARDLESS of whether the company receives required materials from the client. It further states that delays will not affect the due dates. This is nonsensical. Due dates cannot be guaranteed if the company does not receive needed materials from the client. It's an internal contradiction to promise on-time delivery regardless of client cooperation. Logically, the lack of client input would delay the project.",

        "explanation": "This creates ambiguity because the first sentence states that the remaining $3,100 is to be paid at the completion of the Scope of Work, but the following sentence allows the client to pay the money at anytime, or in multiple installments, before the Scope of Work completion. Thus, the ambiguity of the text makes it an in-text contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This is a clear example of an in-text contradiction. It initially states that the company *must* continue providing customer service and *cannot* alter or stop it. Then, in the very next sentence, it states the company *may* alter or cease providing customer service at its sole discretion. These two sentences directly oppose each other, rendering the obligation to provide customer service unenforceable. The second sentence effectively nullifies the first.",

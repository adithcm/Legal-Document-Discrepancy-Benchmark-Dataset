        "section": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends.",
        "explanation": "This section states that i-on will maintain the website continuously, but then introduces an exception for maintenance. While the intention is to allow for necessary downtime, the term 'reasonable' is ambiguous. There is no defined maximum duration for maintenance, and 'reasonable' is open to subjective interpretation. This creates potential for disputes if the customer deems the maintenance downtime excessive, even if i-on believes it was 'reasonable.' Also, 'best efforts' is vague.",

The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees at their discretion and convenience. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding payment responsibility. It first states the customer *is* responsible for paying a specific fee, then contradicts this by saying they can pay at their 'discretion and convenience.' This implies they can choose when and if they pay, which conflicts with the immediate consequence of 'interruption or discontinuation of services' for non-payment. The second sentence makes the first sentence have no teeth.",

The Customer shall comply with applicable laws, standards, policies, and procedures. The Customer incurs the responsibility to determine what restrictions apply and to review the policies and procedures that will be updated continually. The customer is responsible to use the resources with sensitivity to the rights of others. Any conduct by the Customer that in i-on's sole discretion restricts or inhibits any other user, whether a customer of i-on or a user of any other system, from using and enjoying any of i-on's services is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, the posting or transmitting on or through any of i-on's services, any information that is, in i-on's sole discretion, unlawful, obscene, threatening, abusive, libelous, or harmful, or encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any local, state, national, or International law.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'in i-on's sole discretion' is used multiple times in this section. This creates a significant imbalance of power, giving i-on wide latitude to determine what constitutes unacceptable conduct or harmful information. While some level of discretion is necessary, this wording provides no objective standards or recourse for the customer if they believe i-on's judgment is arbitrary or unfair. The discretion is overly broad, lacks transparency, and could lead to inconsistent application.",

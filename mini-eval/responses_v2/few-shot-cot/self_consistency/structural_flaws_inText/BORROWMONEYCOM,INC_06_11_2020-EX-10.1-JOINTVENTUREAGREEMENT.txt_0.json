        "explanation": "The purpose clause initially defines the venture's scope as IT development and back-office maintenance for a medical service. However, the added sentence grants BorrowMoney.com, Inc. unilateral authority to change the purpose at any time. This contradicts the initial definition and creates uncertainty, as JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go's involvement is predicated on the original purpose. A drastic change could render their investment or expertise irrelevant and negatively impact their interest in the joint venture.",

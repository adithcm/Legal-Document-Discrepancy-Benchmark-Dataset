        "explanation": "This section outlines the purpose of the joint venture. However, the second sentence which states that this purpose can be changed at any time at the discretion of BorrowMoney.com, inc. contradicts the fundamental principle of a joint venture, which implies mutual agreement and benefit. This gives BorrowMoney.com, inc. unilateral control over a critical aspect of the venture, potentially undermining JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go's interests and expectations. This clause undermines the very essence of a JOINT venture.",

        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'ENDORSEMENT' in Section 2.A severely limits its scope to only the consultant's name, excluding typical elements associated with endorsements like likeness or signature. However, subsequent sections (e.g., 4.A, 20) refer to using the consultant's 'name, facsimile signature, nickname, voice or likeness.' This inconsistency creates an in-text contradiction because the definition of ENDORSEMENT excludes these elements, but other clauses imply their permissible use under the endorsement agreement.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his sole discretion, use any golf clubs he desires, including those from competitors. He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "Section 5 grants the consultant the right to use any golf clubs, including competitors' products, but then encourages using the MANDATORY PRODUCT 'whenever feasible'. This contradicts the definition of 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS' in Section 2.C, which specifies that the consultant 'must exclusively play/use' those products. The term is not defined well, as there is no reason given on if the consultant cannot use the product.",

The actual base compensation shall be determined annually based on Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion. No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces ambiguity. It states ADAMS GOLF 'may' pay compensation 'up to' a certain amount, contingent on financial performance and their discretion. It ends with 'No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon' which contradicts the entire section. The sentence is vague and does not state what happens if both do not agree.",

        "section": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party. However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The text presents a contradiction. It first states that the agreement can be terminated 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty', but then immediately contradicts this by stating 'However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee'. This creates ambiguity as to whether a penalty applies upon termination and under what specific circumstances.",

Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section contains an ambiguity regarding the liability for subcontractor actions. While it states that Domini's responsibility is 'limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage,' it also states that 'Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.' This is contradictory because even if the subcontractor has liability insurance, Domini denies responsibility if the actions are outside the contracted services, which can include negligence in those services. Thus, there is a discrepancy.",

Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section appears structurally flawed. It is exceptionally long and covers a wide range of expenses, making it difficult to parse and understand the precise allocation of responsibility for each type of expense. While it attempts to delineate which party is responsible for various charges, the lack of a more organized structure (e.g., bullet points, sub-sections) makes it hard to quickly reference and can lead to misinterpretations.",

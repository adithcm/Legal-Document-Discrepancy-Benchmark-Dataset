        "explanation": "Having the day of the agreement as \"Friday, March 2020\" is structurally flawed. The 20th day of March 2020 was a Friday, so the text is technically accurate, but the inclusion of 'Friday' is structurally unsound and unusual for a legal document. It introduces unnecessary information that can be easily verified and adds no legal value. Including the day of the week can also introduce ambiguity if there's a typo and the day of the week does not match the calendar date.",

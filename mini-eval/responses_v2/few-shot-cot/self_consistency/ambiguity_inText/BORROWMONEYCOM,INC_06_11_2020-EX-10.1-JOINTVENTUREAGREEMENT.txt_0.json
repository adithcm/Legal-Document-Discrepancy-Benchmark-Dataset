        "section": "The duration of this Venture (the \"Term\") will begin on March 1, 2020 and continue in full force and effect until February 28, 2025, unless terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the Managers.",
        "explanation": "The term is defined as starting on March 1, 2020 and ending on February 28, 2025. This creates an in-text contradiction because, in most years, February has 28 days, but the agreement was made in 2020 which was a leap year, meaning the parties may get confused by the terms of the agreement if not followed precisely.",

        "section": "The Managers will jointly decide major issues concerning the Venture. Where Managers are unable to reach agreement in deciding major issues, approval by a majority vote of the Managers will be required.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines a contradiction in how major decisions are made. It first states that Managers must jointly decide on major issues, implying unanimous agreement. However, it then states that if they can't agree, a majority vote of the Managers will suffice. This creates ambiguity as to whether unanimity is initially required or if a majority vote is always acceptable for major decisions, leading to a potential dispute.",

Where Members' interests are affected, additional capital contributions (the \"Additional Capital Contributions\") must have the unanimous consent of the Managers.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a structural flaw in the sense that, the decision of the managers does not account for the contribution of the individual members, which is a structural flaw because it does not acknowledge how the members will react to the contributions and the potential monetary disagreements that might arise.",

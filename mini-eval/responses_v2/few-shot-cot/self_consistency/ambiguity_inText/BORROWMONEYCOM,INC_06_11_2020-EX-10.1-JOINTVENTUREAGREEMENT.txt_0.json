        "section": "11. The Managers will jointly decide major issues concerning the Venture. Where Managers are unable to reach agreement in deciding major issues, approval by a majority vote of the Managers will be required.",
        "explanation": "This section establishes a contradiction in how major issues are decided. First, it states that the managers must jointly decide major issues, implying a need for unanimous agreement. However, the following sentence allows for a majority vote to override this, creating ambiguity. This means a single manager could be overruled, undermining the initial requirement for joint decision-making. This is an internal inconsistency because it presents two different mechanisms for deciding major issues without clear criteria on when each applies.",

        "explanation": "The stated capital contribution for BorrowMoney.com includes 'Leased/rent office Space Includingspecified Description of duty*', but the asterisk suggests that there is an omission regarding the duty specified as Section 1.2 above. Thus Section 1.2 is an essential condition for BorrowMoney.com to contribute, but the details are omitted. Also, there are duties tied to BorrowMoney.com's capital contribution (HTML, code, build, deploy and maintain all technical aspect requirements). By including specified duties that are part of the general duties listed in section 13, there is a misalignment that occurs because the actual duty is not defined.",

        "section": "39. In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Venture will be determined based on the fair market value appraisal of all Venture assets (less liabilities) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members. A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.",
        "explanation": "This section defines how the value of the Venture is calculated upon a member's withdrawal or dissolution. However, it lacks a clear mechanism for what happens if the members cannot agree on an independent accounting firm. Without a default resolution, this creates ambiguity and a potential deadlock, which undermines the section's intent to ensure a smooth valuation process. There is ambiguity because the statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. The selection of an appraiser is ambiguous.",

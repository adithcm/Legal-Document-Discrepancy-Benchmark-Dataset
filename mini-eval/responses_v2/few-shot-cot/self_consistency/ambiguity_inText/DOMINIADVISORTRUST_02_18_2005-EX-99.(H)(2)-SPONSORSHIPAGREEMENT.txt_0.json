        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section attempts to define the Sponsor's liability, but it contradicts fundamental principles of liability under law. It states the Sponsor is 'fully liable' for any 'error of judgment or mistake of law' that results in a monetary loss, even without 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder'. Typically, liability requires some level of culpability or negligence. Holding a party liable for a mere 'error of judgment' or 'mistake of law,' without any element of fault, is highly unusual and likely unenforceable under most legal standards. This clause effectively eliminates the standard of care normally required to establish liability, creating a situation where the Sponsor is strictly liable for any loss resulting from their actions, regardless of how reasonable or prudent they were. This is a legal contradiction because liability is being imposed without a legally recognized basis for doing so.",

        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding Domini's responsibility for subcontractors. The clause initially states that Domini does not need Trustee approval to subcontract and then limits Domini's responsibility for the subcontractors' actions and omissions to cases of gross negligence. However, Domini is still the party entering into the contract. Generally, the contracting party is responsible for actions/negligence from the subcontractor. The text is trying to state that Domini is only responsible in cases of gross negligence, which is a legal contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The termination clause creates ambiguity. It states the agreement can be terminated 'at any time' but requires 'payment of a penalty equal to one year of the average management fees.' This introduces a structural flaw in the legal terms. The text does not structure its legal definitions properly, leading to ambiguity.",

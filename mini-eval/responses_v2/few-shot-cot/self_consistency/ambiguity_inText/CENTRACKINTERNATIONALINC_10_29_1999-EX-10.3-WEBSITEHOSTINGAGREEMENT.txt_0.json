        "explanation": "This clause initially promises continuous operation (24/7). However, the exception for maintenance, scheduled at i-on's convenience and *without prior notice*, directly contradicts the initial promise. The lack of notice makes it impossible for the customer to prepare for downtime, negating the 'continuous' service commitment. This creates an ambiguity as the level of continuous service that i-on needs to provide.",

        "explanation": "The contract states it begins September 1, 2004, but the agreement is entered into on January 13, 2005. The term is for a period of years and months redacted, but the termination date is also redacted. This makes it impossible to verify that the commencement and termination dates are consistent with the stated term length. This omission creates ambiguity and internal inconsistency about the actual duration of the agreement.",

        "explanation": "This section requires the Consultant to exclusively use 'Mandatory Products,' which are defined in Section 2C. However, it also states the consultant may play clubs that are not Adams Golf clubs. By not identifying the number of acceptable clubs, this is a contradiction within the text.",

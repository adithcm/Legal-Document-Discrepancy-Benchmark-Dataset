        "section": "Multiple LINAC and Multi-Modality Distributor Agreement (\"Agreement\") is entered into by and between ACCURAY  INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation with its executive offices located at 1310 Chesapeake Terrace, Sunnyvale, California 94089, USA  (\"Accuray\"), and SIEMENS AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a corporation formed under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, with its registered  offices located at Berlin and Munich (\"Siemens\"), as of June 8, 2010 (\"Effective Date\").",
        "explanation": "The agreement states that it is between Accuray and Siemens. Later, under Section 1.3, it defines 'Distributor' to mean Siemens, its Affiliates, *or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the Products and/or Services by Siemens*. This creates ambiguity. The opening paragraph clearly states the agreement is between Accuray and Siemens. Section 1.3 expands the definition of 'Distributor' to include unspecified third parties. This introduces uncertainty. If the agreement applies to these third parties, they are not signatories to the contract, creating a structural issue.",

        "section": "2.2.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Distributor may present for approval  to Accuray opportunities for sales of Products and Services at prices that differ from the prices set forth in the then current  price list. Accuray may, in its sole and absolute discretion, approve any such opportunity, and if approved in writing by  Accuray, Distributor shall otherwise be permitted to pursue such opportunity at such prices, which opportunity shall  otherwise be governed by and pursued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section grants Accuray 'sole and absolute discretion' to approve sales opportunities at prices differing from the price list. This contradicts Section 2.3.2, which states that Accuray's determination to approve the issuance of a Quote shall be made in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Schedule 2.3.2 attached hereto. The 'sole and absolute discretion' clause suggests unlimited power, while Section 2.3.2 ties Accuray's approval to specific conditions in Schedule 2.3.2. This is an in-text contradiction.",

        "section": "Accuray shall advise Distributor in writing within two weeks of the confirmation of the Purchase Order of any information or data required by Accuray to comply with an Export Regulation, including without limitation:\n\n(a) All applicable export list numbers, including the Export Control      11\n\nClassification Number according to the U.S. Commerce Control List (ECCN);\n\n(b) The statistical commodity code according to the current commodity classification for foreign trade statistics and the HS (Harmonized System) coding;\n\n(c) The country of origin (non-preferential origin); and\n\n(d) Accuray's declaration of preferential origin (in case of European suppliers) or preferential certificates (in case of  non-European suppliers).",
        "explanation": "The structure of (d) is flawed. It specifies Accuray's declaration of preferential origin (in case of European suppliers) *or* preferential certificates (in case of  non-European suppliers). The text does not structure well and creates a structural flaw. It should refer to preferential certificates only for non-European Suppliers, but the structure is flawed.",

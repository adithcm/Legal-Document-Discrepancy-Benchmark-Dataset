        "section": "8.1 TERM. The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement. A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect. In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "The text states that the agreement can be renewed by mutual written agreement of the parties, this implies that there is an active decision to renew the agreement. However, the text also states that 'In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.' This means that there is a passive renewal, as there is no decision making involved. This is a contradiction because it states it will need the approval of both parties, while the following sentence states that the agreement will be automatically renewed.",

Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference. However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This section discusses force majeure and excuses performance except for payment obligations. However, it then states that the occurrence of a force majeure event *does not* limit obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification). Indemnification obligations could certainly involve payment. This is a contradiction as the first sentence seems to limit the exception (excused performance) to non-payment obligations and then the last sentence creates an exception to that exception by explicitly including indemnification which would presumably include payments. It is unclear whether payment obligations are excused under force majeure events.",

        "explanation": "The structure of the language here is confusing because of the parenthesis after 'i-Escrow, Inc.'. The language is structured in a way that makes it unclear whether or not the text in parenthesis, applies to the text inside and outside of it, giving it a structural flaw.",

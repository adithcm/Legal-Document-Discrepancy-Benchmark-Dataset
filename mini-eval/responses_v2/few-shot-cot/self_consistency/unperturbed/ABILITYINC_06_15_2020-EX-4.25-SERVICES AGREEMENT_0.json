        "section": "1.2 Standard of Service.  (c) Provider shall use its best efforts to provide for employees or contractors to perform the Services, each of whose names, positions, and respective levels of experience and relevant licenses shall be set out in Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Provider Representatives\"). Provider may not make any change in the Provider Representatives without the prior consent of the Recipient. Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "The language dictates that 'Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient' and 'shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider'. If the Provider Representatives are employees of the Provider, restricting them from providing any services to the Provider itself could create a contradiction if their employment contracts with the Provider require them to perform duties for the Provider beyond those solely for the Recipient. This is an in-text contradiction because the contract is restricting the Provider's own employees from working for them, which is unusual.",

        "section": "2.2 Terms of Payment and Related Matters. (a) As consideration for provision of the Services following the Effective Date, Recipient shall pay Provider an amount equal to Provider's actual cost of providing the Services plus a 10% service fee. In addition to such amount, in the event that Provider incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the provision of any Service, including, without limitation, license fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors (such included expenses, collectively, \"Out-of-Pocket Costs\"), Recipient shall reimburse Provider for all such Out-of-Pocket Costs.",
        "explanation": "The agreement states that the Recipient will pay Provider an amount equal to the Provider's actual cost for the services plus a 10% service fee. However, the Provider will use employees/contractors to provide the services. It is never defined if their wages are factored into the actual costs or not. This is an ambiguity.",

        "explanation": "This clause allows either party to terminate the agreement without cause with 90 days' notice. This contradicts the 'Breach' clause 3.3, which allows termination if one party fails to perform its obligations. These clauses are contradictory because 3.2 allows for termination without any reason, while 3.3 requires a material breach of contract.",

        "section": "1. Website Design and Development. Client agrees to pay to Company to design and develop a website for Client (the \"Client Website\") in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. (a) Change Orders. Any changes to the Scope of Work following the execution of this Agreement requiring Additional Work must be submitted to and accepted by Company in writing as a \"Change Order\". Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work. (b) Due Dates and Delays. Company will use its best efforts to deliver the Client Website in the time frame specified in the Scope of Work. Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are subject to delay if Company does not receive the required materials or documentation in a timely manner or in the required format or if approvals are delayed by Client or if the Scope of Work is changed by Client.",
        "explanation": "Section 1(b) states the project timeline is 12 weeks, running from February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018. However, this is internally inconsistent and contradictory. Twelve weeks from February 8, 2018, would end on May 3, 2018. The contract language states that the Due Dates are subject to delay if the company does not receive required materials. If there are delays, the contract doesn't state any new Due Dates and what would occur if these deadlines are not met.",

        "explanation": "This section dictates that a prepayment of $1,900 must be made and the remaining $3,100 must be paid when the Scope of Work is complete. However, the term Scope of Work may be interpreted as Stage 3 because the Exhibit A (Scope of Work) is broken up into three stages. Thus, this may cause confusion, disagreements or contradiction between both parties. The agreement does not mention what would happen if the Stage 3 is not completed.",

Any email or telephone correspondence received after normal business hours will be processed the following business day. Client shall pay an additional surcharge for any services requiring work to be performed outside of normal business hours by reason of a rush deadline requested by Client or as a result of Client's failure to meet scheduled times for delivery and/or review and approval of information, content and materials. The surcharge for rush work shall be the hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%).",
        "explanation": "The contract states that the 'surcharge for rush work shall be the hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%)'. However, the contract does not specify what the hourly rate is for standard work. Thus, because this information is omitted, it creates ambiguity and may create a contradiction in determining the rate for surcharge work.",

        "explanation": "The term 'Mandatory Products' is intended to define the specific ADAMS GOLF products that the Consultant is required to use exclusively. However, the actual products are redacted, resulting in a list of requirements without specifying which products fulfill those requirements. This creates an in-text contradiction as the contract defines a term but fails to provide the essential details that give the term meaning.

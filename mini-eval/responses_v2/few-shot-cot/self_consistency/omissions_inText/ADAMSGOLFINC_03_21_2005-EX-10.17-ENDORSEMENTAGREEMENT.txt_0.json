        "explanation": "The contract states the term is for a certain number of years and months commencing September 1, 2004, but the specific end date is redacted ( [*****] day of [*****] ). This omission creates ambiguity as the actual duration of the contract is undefined. This is an in-text contradiction since a defined term is essential for determining obligations and deadlines throughout the contract.",

This clause introduces an exception specifically in cases of ADAMS GOLF'S insolvency or bankruptcy, where the consultant continues to perform. It doesn't clearly state if sections 8 and 22 are void in the event of bankruptcy/insolvency, or if it is related to the repayment of the base compensation or performance bonuses only.

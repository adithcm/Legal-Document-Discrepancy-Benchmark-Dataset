Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The section states the Sponsor provides \"oversight, administrative, and management services as requested by the Trust.\" However, it then states the Sponsor \"shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice.\" This is a contradiction because 'management services' typically *include* asset management and investment advice. The language creates ambiguity as to what 'management services' actually entails and whether the Sponsor is truly providing management services if they are explicitly excluded from managing assets or providing investment advice.",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section details how expenses are allocated. Domini pays the salaries of Trustees affiliated with Domini, and the Trust pays 'compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor.' However, the phrase \"compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor\" is vague and lacks clarity on how their compensation is determined. This creates a structural flaw making it hard to understand and thus could cause disagreements. There is no specification of the maximum allowable compensation, nor the method for determining it, creating an open-ended liability for the Trust.",

        "explanation": "This section outlines the compensation for the Sponsor. It states that the Trust will pay Domini a 'mutually agreed upon fee.' However, it lacks specifics on how the fee is determined, when it is paid, or any escalation clauses. It is vaguely written and does not have enough details, which makes the fee hard to calculate. Thus it is structually flawed. It simply mentions a fee that is to be paid but does not do enough in detail to fully define how much this fee could be and how it is to be calculated.",

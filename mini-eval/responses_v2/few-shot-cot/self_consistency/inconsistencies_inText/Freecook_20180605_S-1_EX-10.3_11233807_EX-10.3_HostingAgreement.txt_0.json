Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "There's a contradiction in the project's timeline. The agreement states the company will use its best efforts to deliver within the timeframe specified in the Scope of Work, setting the project's term as 12 weeks, ending May 3, 2018. But it simultaneously 'guarantees' completion within 8 weeks. This creates ambiguity around what is considered the agreed-upon completion date and what penalties would apply if the project is completed between the 8th and 12th week. It's unclear if 'best efforts' to deliver within 12 weeks negates the 8-week guarantee or if the guarantee supersedes the 'best efforts' clause.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence in section 2 states that 'the client agrees to pay to the company a total of $5,000' which directly cotradicts the second sentence where it says 'Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 according to the following milestone schedule' in the original version of the contract. Although the contract does mention that the amount due is $5,000, it is not clear as to what the immediate payent due is. After the contract has been signed, it mentions that the client shall make a prepayemtn of $1,900.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces ambiguity in calculating the rush work surcharge. It stipulates that the surcharge will be either the 'standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%)' or a 'flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.' The calculation of $40 + 25% is not a hourly rate calculation, as it just adds the rate + $10. Therefor the surcharge would be $50 or a flat fee of $100, which is lower, but the grammar of the sentence implies that it should be a standard hourly rate, but $50 is not. It's unclear how the $40 and 25% relates.",

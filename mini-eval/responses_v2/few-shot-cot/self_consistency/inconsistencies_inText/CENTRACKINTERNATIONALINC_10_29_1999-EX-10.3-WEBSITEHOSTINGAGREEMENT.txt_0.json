        "explanation": "The agreement states i-on will maintain continuous operation of the hosted site 24/7, but then contradicts this by allowing for maintenance at any time of day, including weekdays. This creates an ambiguity because if maintenance occurs during peak hours, it directly conflicts with the promise of continuous operation.",

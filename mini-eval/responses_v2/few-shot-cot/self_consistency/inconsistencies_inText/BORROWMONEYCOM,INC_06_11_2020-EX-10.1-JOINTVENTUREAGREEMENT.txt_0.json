        "explanation": "The text includes both the day of the week ('Friday') and the full date ('March 20, 2020').  This is structurally flawed because the day of the week might not correspond to the date.  If March 20, 2020, was not a Friday, this creates ambiguity. While not a huge legal issue, it demonstrates poor drafting and potential for misunderstanding, necessitating clarification or correction. While this error does not by itself create any in-text legal contradictions or conflicts under state or federal law that could cause issues of ambiguity in legal terms, the incorrect date can bring up issues in legal terms.",

        "explanation": "This table outlines the duties of each member. For BorrowMoney.com, inc., the description is unclear and grammatically incorrect ('HTML code...employees/personal'). This lacks clarity. More significantly, *there is no clearly defined remedy if BorrowMoney.com fails to meet these vaguely defined obligations.* The contract needs to specify consequences for non-performance of these technical duties. Similarly, the phrasing 'medical dispatch personal & product service as needed' is ambiguous. What is the scope of 'as needed'? Who determines the need? These points would lead to disputes.",

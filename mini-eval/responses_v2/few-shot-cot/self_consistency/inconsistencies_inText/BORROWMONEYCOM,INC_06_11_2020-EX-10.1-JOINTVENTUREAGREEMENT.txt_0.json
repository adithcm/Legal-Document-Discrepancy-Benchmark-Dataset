        "section": "THIS JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT (the \"Agreement\") made and entered into this 20th day of Friday, March 2020 (the \"Execution Date\"),",
        "explanation": "The date format is structurally flawed.  The inclusion of 'Friday' within the date is grammatically incorrect and stylistically inconsistent with standard legal document dating conventions. A properly structured date would simply state \"this 20th day of March 2020\". The addition of the day of the week creates a structural flaw because it interrupts the expected flow of the sentence and deviates from established legal writing norms for date specification.",

        "explanation": "This section demonstrates a structural flaw due to improper capitalization and punctuation.  The sentence mixes capitalized and lowercase words in an unsystematic way (e.g., 'IT Development' vs. 'internet').  Furthermore, the use of periods is inconsistent and does not form proper sentences. The lack of proper sentence structure and capitalization makes the purpose of the joint venture difficult to understand and legally ambiguous.",

        "explanation": "The structural flaw lies in the nonsensical language of this entry. The mixing of square footage ('1,500 square feet') with 'Leased/rent office Space Includingspecified Description of duty*' creates an incoherent phrase. The phrase 'Includingspecified Description of duty*' is grammatically incorrect and unclear, suggesting an incomplete or poorly worded thought. Finally, the monetary value assigned to the space is questionable, creating further doubt on the language used in the description.",

        "explanation": "The structural flaw arises from the misplaced monetary value. The monetary value '$3,500,000.00 USD' does not fit grammatically within this contribution. The reference to a value being $3,500,000 does not make sense in the context of the contribution section. It seems to suggest that the contribution value and generated gross revenue are also valued at $3,500,000",

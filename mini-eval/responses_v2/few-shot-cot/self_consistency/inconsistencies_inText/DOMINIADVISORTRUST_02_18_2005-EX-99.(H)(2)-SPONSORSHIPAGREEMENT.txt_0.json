        "section": "2. Allocation of Charges and Expenses. Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2. The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The text indicates Domini will cover legal counsel fees in this section. This creates ambiguity about which legal fees Domini covers, and potentially contradicts any general understanding that the Trust would bear its own legal expenses related to compliance or other activities. It is unclear as to what extent Domini covers these legal counsel fees.",

This Agreement shall become effective as of the day and year first above written and shall govern the relations between the parties hereto thereafter, unless terminated as set forth in this Section 6. This Agreement may not be altered or amended, except by an instrument in writing and executed by both parties. This Agreement may be terminated at any time, with the payment of a penalty of $10,000, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.",
        "explanation": "The text says that it may be terminated at anytime, with the payment of a penalty of $10,000. However, the text also indicates that you must give the other party a 60 days' written notice to the other party. The first statement says that you can terminate at anytime and the second statement requires you to provide a 60 days' written notice. Thus, this is a contradiction.",

        "explanation": "The section 'Domini is not responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor' has a potential legal flaw. Under standard agency law, a principal (here, the Trust) can hold an agent (Domini) liable for the acts of a sub-agent (the subcontractor) if the agent had the authority to appoint the sub-agent. This is a legal contradiction because general legal principles regarding agency may impose liability on Domini for the subcontractor's actions, despite the contract's disclaimer.",

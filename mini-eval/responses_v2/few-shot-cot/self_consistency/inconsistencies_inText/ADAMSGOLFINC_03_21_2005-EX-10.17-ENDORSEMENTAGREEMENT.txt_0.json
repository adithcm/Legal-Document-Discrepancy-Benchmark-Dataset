        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1. Year 1. $[*****]\n2. Year 2 $[*****]\n3. Year 3 $[*****]\n4. Year 4 $[*****]\n5. Year 5 $[*****]\nB.Payment shall be made to ADAMS GOLF within three months following the end of the calendar year. For example, if in the calendar year 2005 CONSULTANT achieves a satisfactory record of play in [*****] events, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF [*****] dollars no later than March 31, 2006.\nC.In the event that CONSULTANT is prevented from competing for reasons outside his control, the parties agree to a good faith attempt to resolve the issues. If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "Paragraph 8A outlines a repayment schedule if the consultant fails to meet the minimum number of events. However, paragraph 8C states that if the consultant is prevented from competing due to reasons outside their control, a good faith attempt to resolve the issues will be made. If no resolution is reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment. This creates a contradiction, as it's unclear if repayment is *always* required for missed events, or *only* at ADAMS GOLF's discretion when the absence is due to reasons beyond the consultant's control. It's also unclear what criteria constitutes a 'good faith attempt to resolve the issues.' The initial statement makes it sound mandatory, where the last statement makes it sound discretionary and up to Adams Golf. 'Good faith attempt to resolve the issues' is ambiguous.",

        "explanation": "Paragraph 18 states that the base compensation shall be paid upon the completion of each calendar year of the contract, implying a yearly payment schedule. Paragraph 23 states that upon termination for cause, the consultant shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed. This implies that the compensation is being paid in advance or there is an obligation to continue the work, if not then there is no period not performed by the consultant.",

Upon such termination, CONSULTANT shall be required to repay ADAMS GOLF for that period of the Agreement not performed by CONSULTANT. The repayment amount shall be calculated in the same way as repayment is calculated under paragraph 8A.",
        "explanation": "Paragraph 23 outlines the conditions for termination for cause, but it conflicts with the broader statement in the first line that this paragraph applies, 'Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this Agreement'. Paragraph 8 (Minimum Number of Tournaments and Potential Repayment of Base Compensation) already specifies conditions under which ADAMS GOLF may demand repayment. Making repayment contingent on 'cause' introduces an inconsistency. It becomes unclear whether the events in Paragraph 8 can result in repayment independently, or whether they are subject to the 'for cause' requirement of paragraph 23. The language in 23 also does not make sense. What does 'that period of the Agreement not performed by Consultant mean?' Was consultant supposed to do something for 5 years? If Adams Golf terminated the agreement after 2 years, does that mean that Watson is supposed to give back the money given to him for those two years?.",

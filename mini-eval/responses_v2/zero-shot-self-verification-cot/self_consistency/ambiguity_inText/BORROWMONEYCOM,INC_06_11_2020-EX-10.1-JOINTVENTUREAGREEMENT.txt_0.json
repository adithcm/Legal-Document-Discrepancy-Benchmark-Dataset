        "explanation": "The Term of the joint venture is defined as starting on March 1, 2020 and ending on February 28, 2025. This creates a term of less than five years. This could be problematic if the purpose of the venture requires a longer time frame or if any agreements were made with the understanding of a full five-year term.",

        "explanation": "The termination clause allows for early termination by 'mutual agreement of the Managers'. However, Section 8 states that Managers may be appointed, replaced, or removed upon unanimous consent of the Members. There is no mention on how to handle a situation where a Manager is not fulfilling his duty. This could lead to disputes if the Members are not in agreement on a decision.",

        "explanation": "This statement regarding the resolution of disagreements among managers through a majority vote contradicts the earlier statement in Section 10 that 'Conduct and actions of the Managers will be dictated by policy and procedure established by the Members'. If the Members set policy, it's unclear how the Managers' majority vote supersedes or interacts with that policy. This creates ambiguity in decision-making authority.",

        "explanation": "The document states that Managers will jointly decide major issues, but if they cannot agree, a majority vote of the managers is required. However, it does not define how many managers there should be or how a majority vote is calculated if there is an even number of managers, creating an unclear and potentially unworkable mechanism for resolving disagreements.",

        "explanation": "This section states that changes to capital contributions can be made by the Managers. However, when Member's interests are affected, then a unanimous consent of the Managers is needed. This contradicts the statement in Section 11 that the Managers will jointly decide major issues and a majority vote will be required if they do not come to an agreement. There is no mention of the Members making a decision when it comes to capital contributions.",

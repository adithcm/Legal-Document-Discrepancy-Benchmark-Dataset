        "explanation": "The phrase \"internet Back office Maintenance And Deployment of medical Service\" is not grammatically correct and lacks clarity. The intended meaning is unclear, leading to potential disputes over the scope of the Venture's purpose. It's difficult to determine if \"internet\" modifies all subsequent terms or just \"Back office Maintenance\".",

        "explanation": "The valuation of the contributions by each member seems disproportionate and potentially unrealistic.  The description for BorrowMoney.com, Inc. lists 1,500 square feet of leased/rented office space and 'specified description of duty' as being worth $3,500,000.  Similarly, JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go contributes $60,000.00 from contracts plus 10% of gross revenue, which is also valued at $3,500,000.  These valuations are highly suspect and create ambiguity. The actual values may not be accurately reflected, which could lead to disputes over ownership percentage and profit/loss distribution.",

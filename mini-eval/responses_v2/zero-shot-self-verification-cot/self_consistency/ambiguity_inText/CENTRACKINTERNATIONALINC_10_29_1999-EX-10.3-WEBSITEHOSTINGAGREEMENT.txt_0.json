        "section": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of necessary hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will schedule and perform such maintenance at its convenience, without prior notice.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"without prior notice\" directly contradicts the expectation of continuous service, as it gives i-on the right to interrupt service for maintenance at any time, without any obligation to inform the Customer beforehand. This creates a loophole where i-on is technically providing continuous service (as far as the contract reads), while simultaneously having the unconstrained ability to disrupt it. This effectively negates the promise of 24/7 availability.",

The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner may result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
        "explanation": "This section sets the payment terms, stating the customer must pay within 30 days of receiving the invoice, however, the contract does not define what happens after the 30 days. It says, that failure to pay in a timely manner may result in the interruption or discontinuation of the services, but there is no definition of what happens if the Customer pays after the 30 days. This vagueness opens the potential for disputes regarding when service interruption can occur after 30 days.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The contract states that the agreement is for six months and renews for one month periods, however, it provides two different methods of termination. The first is a non-renewal notice 15 days before the end of the term. The second is a 30-day written notice for termination at any time without cause. This could be interpreted that after the initial 6 month term, the agreement auto-renews for an additional month, but the 30-day written notice for termination could overlap and terminate the agreement early. The lack of clarity on which termination clause takes precedence creates potential for confusion.",

This can be considered a discrepancy because a customer would expect to be notified of any maintenance that may be performed on their website. Most hosting providers allow customers to know when they are going to conduct any maintenance on the site, this is not in place. This is an in-text contradiction.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "The term and termination conditions present a contradiction. It states that the agreement automatically renews for one-month periods unless a 15-day notice is given. However, it also states that either party can terminate the agreement at any time with a 30-day notice. This discrepancy arises because the 15-day notice for non-renewal clashes with the 30-day notice for termination. If a party gives a 20-day notice, is that considered a non-renewal or termination?",

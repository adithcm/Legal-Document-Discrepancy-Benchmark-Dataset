        "section": "The Sponsor shall be fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in a monetary loss for the trust during the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
        "explanation": "This section contradicts standard legal principles regarding liability. Generally, a party is not held liable for errors in judgment or mistakes of law unless there is some element of negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct. This clause attempts to impose a strict liability standard, which is unusual and potentially unenforceable, as it holds the Sponsor liable even in the absence of fault. Also, the clause includes a double negative which makes it confusing: \"even without willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.\"",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"at any time\" directly conflicts with the requirement of providing \"not less than 60 days' written notice.\" If the agreement can be terminated \"at any time,\" the 60-day notice period becomes meaningless. The two phrases contradict each other because, in order to terminate, you need to wait 60 days after termination, which directly contradicts \"at any time.\"",

        "explanation": "This section contains conflicting statements regarding Domini's responsibility for subcontractors. It initially states that Domini can subcontract without needing approval from the Trustees that the subcontracting party is qualified. However, it goes on to state that Domini is not fully responsible for the actions of the subcontractor, except in cases of gross negligence. This creates a contradiction because Domini is relieved of the responsibility to check the qualifications of the subcontractor. Domini should be responsible for the actions of the subcontractor, unless it can prove that the subcontractor was not qualified to perform such actions.",

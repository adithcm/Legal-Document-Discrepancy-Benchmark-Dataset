        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons without needing approval from the Trustees of the Trust to find the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini shall not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding Domini's liability for subcontractors. It first states that Domini can subcontract without needing approval from the Trustees regarding the subcontractor's qualifications. However, it then states that Domini is 'not be fully responsible' for the subcontractor's actions, except in cases of gross negligence. This implies a partial responsibility even outside of gross negligence, creating an ambiguity. The extent of this 'partial responsibility' is not defined, which is a discrepancy.",

        "explanation": "The exculpation of Domini's liability for subcontractors' actions, except in cases of gross negligence, raises a legal concern. Investment management agreements often involve stringent standards of care and fiduciary duties.  Subcontracting critical functions without retaining full responsibility could be viewed as a breach of fiduciary duty under applicable investment company laws, potentially violating federal securities regulations if it leads to harm to the Trust or its shareholders.  The limited liability clause might not be enforceable if it is deemed to violate these overriding legal principles.",

        "explanation": "This section states the Sponsor is fully liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law that results in monetary loss. This wording appears to eliminate any requirement of negligence or malfeasance for the Sponsor to be held liable. This creates a very high standard of liability that conflicts with general principles of contract law, which usually requires some level of fault (negligence, recklessness, intentional misconduct) for a party to be held liable for damages.  The term \"fully liable\" is ambiguous and could be interpreted very broadly by a court.",

        "explanation": "The termination clause describes a penalty equal to one year of average management fees. However, the use of 'average management fees collected over the prior three years' is unclear because it does not explicitly clarify what happens if the agreement is terminated within the first three years when there isn't a 'prior three years' worth of data. This can lead to disputes on calculating management fees during the first three years.",

        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name solely for marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. This excludes use of likeness or image for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing.",
        "explanation": "The definition of 'ENDORSEMENT' is limited to the use of the CONSULTANT's name in marketing materials directly created by ADAMS GOLF. It explicitly excludes the use of the consultant's 'likeness or image' for promotional events unless specifically agreed upon in writing. However, Section 3, titled 'CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT', grants ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right and license to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT. This creates a contradiction, because Section 3 appears to grant broader rights than are defined in Section 2.A, particularly with respect to 'advertising and promotion,' which commonly involves likeness and image.",

EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT, except that CONSULTANT is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction, provided he makes a good faith effort to use ADAMS GOLF products whenever possible.",
        "explanation": "This clause presents an in-text contradiction. The first part states the consultant 'shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT', which clearly establishes an obligation. However, the clause then contradicts itself by stating the CONSULTANT is permitted to use equipment from any manufacturer without restriction, provided he makes a good faith effort to use ADAMS GOLF products whenever possible.' The 'good faith effort' provision does not change the fact that there is no restriction. It is unclear what constitutes a 'good faith effort', how it would be measured, and what the consequences are for failing to make a good faith effort. This is a contradiction because the clause is trying to establish exclusivity of the product but does not.",

ADAMS GOLF shall reimburse CONSULTANT for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances. Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation.",
        "explanation": "The language in section 11B is structurally flawed. The first sentence grants the Consultant full discretion to participate in promotional activities. The section sentence drastically cuts back on the financial compensation that the consultant will get for the events. The first sentence should not be in place. This is a structural flaw.",

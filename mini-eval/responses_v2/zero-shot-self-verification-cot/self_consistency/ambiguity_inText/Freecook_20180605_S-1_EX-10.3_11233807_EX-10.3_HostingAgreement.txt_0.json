        "explanation": "The contract states that the client will pay a 'reasonable sum' but fails to define the exact amount or provide a clear method for determining what constitutes a 'reasonable sum.' Although it mentions the 'Contract Price,' this price isn't explicitly stated in this section or cross-referenced to another section where it is clearly defined. The lack of a specific price or a definitive way to calculate it creates ambiguity and makes the contract unenforceable as it pertains to payment. There is no number that states how much the client will pay, leaving room for misinterpretation.",

Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay.",
        "explanation": "The statement 'Company guarantees to deliver the Client Website in the time frame specified in the Scope of Work' conflicts with the subsequent statement: 'Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay.' Guarantees are usually firm commitments, but the follow-up sentence about due dates not being subject to delay makes it unclear if Company is liable for delays. Any due date is subject to change if both parties agree in writing. Also the dates are not aligned, it would be 11 weeks not 12 weeks.",

The surcharge for rush work may be different from the standard hourly rate.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'Client may be asked to pay an additional surcharge' is ambiguous because it doesn't specify under what conditions the surcharge will be applied or how it will be calculated. The contract does not explicitly state if the client has a choice on paying the fee or the exact amount of the fee. There is no way to verify how much the extra charge will be.",

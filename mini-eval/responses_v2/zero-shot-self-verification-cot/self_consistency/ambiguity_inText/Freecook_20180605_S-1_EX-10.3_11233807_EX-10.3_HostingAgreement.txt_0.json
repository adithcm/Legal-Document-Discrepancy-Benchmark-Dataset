        "section": "Client acknowledges and agrees that any due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are not subject to any delay. <*$p$*>",
        "explanation": "This statement is overly broad and potentially unenforceable. While it intends to emphasize the importance of meeting deadlines, it's unrealistic to claim that *any* delay is unacceptable, regardless of the cause. Unforeseen circumstances (illness, natural disasters, etc.) could legitimately cause delays, and this clause doesn't account for such possibilities. In law, clauses preventing any delay are difficult to enforce. This creates a potential contradiction because standard legal principles would likely allow for reasonable delays under certain circumstances, conflicting with the contract's absolute prohibition.",

        "explanation": "This creates a potential legal issue concerning consent and publicity rights. While the clause addresses *unsolicited* positive feedback, it doesn't explicitly obtain consent for using the Client's name, likeness, or specific statements in marketing materials. Depending on the jurisdiction, using a client's feedback as a testimonial without express and informed consent could violate privacy laws or publicity rights. There should be a disclaimer ensuring that the client has to actively give consent for any and all information provided to be used for company publicity.",

        "explanation": "The definition of \"completion of the scope of work\" can be interpreted differently. This is an ambiguous statement because it does not clearly define 'completion of the Scope of Work'. Is it when the website is designed, when it is developed, or when it is hosted and live? If the Client believes that the job is not complete or that the company did not fulfill all obligations, they may withhold payment. This is a contradiction because it is ambiguous in the legal sense of when payment is due.",

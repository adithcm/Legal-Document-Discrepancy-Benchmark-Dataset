        "explanation": "The use of 'may' suggests that the Sponsor's performance of services is discretionary, while the phrase 'which shall include without limitation' implies that the subsequent listed services are mandatory aspects of the Sponsor's duties. This creates a contradiction because it's unclear whether the Sponsor is obligated to perform any specific service or whether their performance is entirely subject to their discretion and the Trust's requests.",

        "explanation": "This section contains a double negative and creates confusion around the Sponsor's responsibilities. The phrase 'shall also be fully responsible for... nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility' is contradictory and unclear. It's difficult to discern whether the Sponsor has any responsibility for the listed functions (management of assets, investment advice, and distribution of shares) or whether those responsibilities are exclusively assigned to other agents. This ambiguity could lead to disputes regarding the Sponsor's duties.",

        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction. The first sentence stipulates that Domini pays salaries and wages of Trustees/officers/agents devoting time to Domini's affairs. The second sentence then states the Trust will pay compensation to Trustees 'not affiliated with the Sponsor.' This creates an inconsistency. Are there Trustees who are both affiliated with Domini and also compensated by the Trust? If so, this contradicts the first sentence. If not, why the distinction?",

        "explanation": "The text states that Domini is to be paid a fee of '0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets' and that the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated if the time period is less than specified.  However, the document doesn't specify how such proration should be calculated.  Specifically, it fails to explain the method of calculation when the agreement does not encompass the entire fiscal year. This lack of clarity can lead to disputes over the correct amount owed.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder' is not a clearly defined legal term and is open to interpretation.

The document needs to define the term 'any series' and explain how it functions in accordance with the termination of the agreement.

        "explanation": "The contract identifies Mitchell's Web Advance, PLC as the \"Service Provider.\" However, later in Section 4, \"Customer Service\" is to be provided by \"Service Provider, either directly or through its authorized vendor\". Then, in the next sentence, 'Company is not obligated to provide any Customer Service'. This presents a misalignment in terminology. Are 'Company' and 'Service provider' the same entity or not? It makes it unclear as to who is responsible for Customer service.",

        "explanation": "There is a misalignment in terminology. The paragraph starts by referring to \"Service Provider\" but then switches to \"Entity\" without defining who \"Entity\" is.

        "explanation": "This section contains a direct contradiction. The first sentence states that the Service Provider *shall* provide customer support. The very next sentence then states that the Company is *not* obligated to provide customer service. This creates a fundamental ambiguity as to whether customer service is actually required under the agreement. It's further complicated by the potential misalignment of 'Service Provider' and 'Company'.",

        "explanation": "The Scope of Work (Exhibit A) outlines a multi-stage project. However, the agreement lacks clear acceptance criteria for each stage, especially concerning Client approval before proceeding to the next stage. This omission creates ambiguity and potential disputes about whether the \"completion of the Scope of Work\" requires full completion of all stages, even if the client is unsatisfied with earlier stages. This could lead to disagreements about when the final $3,100 payment is due.",

SEO is an ongoing process, not a one-time completion. This creates ambiguity and conflict. Does 'completion' mean the initial implementation of SEO, or does it imply ongoing SEO services? If the former, what defines the extent of the 'initial implementation'? This lack of clarity leads to a potential dispute over payment terms.",

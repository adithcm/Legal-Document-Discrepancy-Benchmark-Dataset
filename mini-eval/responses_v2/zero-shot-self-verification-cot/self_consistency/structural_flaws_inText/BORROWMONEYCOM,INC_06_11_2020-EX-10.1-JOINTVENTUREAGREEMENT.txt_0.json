        "explanation": "The purpose clause is initially defined as IT development, internet back office maintenance, and deployment of medical services. However, the subsequent sentence grants BorrowMoney.com, inc. unilateral discretion to change this purpose at any time. This creates a potential contradiction because JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go entered the agreement with a specific understanding of the Venture's purpose, which can be altered without their consent. This could lead to disputes if the purpose is changed to something that is not within the original scope or intent of the joint venture.",

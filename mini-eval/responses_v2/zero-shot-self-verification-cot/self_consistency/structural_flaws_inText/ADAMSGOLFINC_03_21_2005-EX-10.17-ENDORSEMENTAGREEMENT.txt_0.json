        "section": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name *only*, excluding fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image. This endorsement is strictly limited to marketing materials that feature only his name and no other identifying characteristics.",
        "explanation": "This section defines the scope of the endorsement rather narrowly, limiting it to the consultant's name only. However, several other clauses throughout the agreement refer to the use of CONSULTANT'S name and/or likeness in advertising. This creates an in-text contradiction, as it is not clear if the intention of the agreement is to limit the endorsement to strictly the name of the consultant. ",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT may, at his sole discretion, use any golf clubs he desires, including those from competitors. He is, however, encouraged to use the MANDATORY PRODUCT whenever feasible. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
        "explanation": "This section states that the Consultant may use any golf clubs he desires, even those from competitors, contradicting the definition of \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS\" in Section 2(C), which states that the consultant *must* exclusively play/use the specified Adams Golf products in all SPGA and PGA events. While it encourages use of mandatory products, it provides no legal reason to do so. The last sentence further exacerbates this issue.",

        "section": "18. BASE COMPENSATION For the entire term of this Agreement, from September 1, 2004 through [*****] ADAMS GOLF may pay CONSULTANT a base compensation of up to [*****] dollars. The actual base compensation shall be determined annually based on Adams Golf's financial performance, at their sole discretion. No compensation shall be paid unless mutually agreed upon.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence seems to establish a framework for base compensation. However, the subsequent sentences completely undermine this by granting Adams Golf complete discretion over whether any compensation is paid at all. The final sentence indicates that base compensation is only to be paid when the 2 parties mutually agree upon it. This creates a contradiction because if it has to be mutually agreed upon every year, it technically does not need to be paid. This language renders the entire section ambiguous and unenforceable regarding base compensation",

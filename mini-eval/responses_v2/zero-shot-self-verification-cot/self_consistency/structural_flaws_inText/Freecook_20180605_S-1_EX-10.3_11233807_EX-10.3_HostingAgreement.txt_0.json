Client acknowledges and agrees that all due dates set forth in the Scope of Work are guaranteed by the Company, regardless of whether the company receives required materials, documentation, or approvals in a timely fashion from the client. Delays will not affect the due dates.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency. While it states the project timeline is fixed (February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018), it simultaneously claims that all due dates are guaranteed by the Company regardless of the Client's input or potential delays in providing necessary materials. This creates an internal contradiction because it's illogical to guarantee deadlines if the Client's actions can impact the Company's ability to meet them. If the client is late providing materials that could affect the end date of the project and the client would not be penalized or required to pay extra.",

        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction. The initial statement mandates that the remaining $3,100 is due upon completion of the Scope of Work. However, the subsequent sentence contradicts this by allowing the Client to pay the remaining amount at any time or in installments before the completion of the Scope of Work. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual payment terms and when the final payment is truly due, as both conditions cannot be true at the same time.",

        "explanation": "The statements made in this section are contradictory. The first sentence imposes an obligation on the Company to continuously provide customer service without alteration or cessation. The second sentence then completely undermines this obligation by granting the Company the discretion to alter or cease providing customer service at any time without liability. These two sentences directly contradict each other, rendering the customer service provision ambiguous and unenforceable.",

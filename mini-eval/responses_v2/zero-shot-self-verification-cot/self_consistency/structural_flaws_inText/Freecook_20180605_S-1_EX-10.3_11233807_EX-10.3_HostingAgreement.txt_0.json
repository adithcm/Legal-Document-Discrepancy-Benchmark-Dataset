Delays will not affect the due dates.",
        "explanation": "This statement is contradictory because it asserts that due dates are guaranteed by the Company, irrespective of the Client's timely delivery of required materials. This is logically inconsistent as the Company's ability to meet deadlines is contingent on receiving necessary inputs from the Client. It's unrealistic and unenforceable to guarantee deadlines when the Company's work is dependent on the Client's actions. Any reasonable interpretation of contract law would consider the Client's cooperation as a condition for the Company's performance.",

        "explanation": "These sentences create a direct contradiction. The first sentence explicitly states that the Company is obligated to continue providing customer service and may not alter or cease it. The very next sentence states that the Company, at its sole discretion, may alter or cease providing the same customer service without any liability. This creates an irreconcilable conflict in the obligations of the Company.",

        "explanation": "While not a direct contradiction, the added sentence introduces ambiguity. The main text states the $3,100 is due on completion. The added text seems to suggest flexibility, allowing payment before completion. However, it doesn't explicitly override the initial statement. This creates potential disputes about when the final payment is actually due. It is not specific and very vague.",

        "section": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, will be subject to renegotiation.",
        "explanation": "This section provides contradictory information regarding the Sponsor's compensation. The first sentence establishes a clear method for calculating the fee (0.50% of average daily net assets). However, the second sentence introduces uncertainty by stating that the compensation will be subject to renegotiation if Domini serves as Sponsor for less than a full period. This contradicts the initial fee structure, creating ambiguity about how compensation is determined in such cases. It's unclear if the 0.50% still applies on a prorated basis or if an entirely new fee arrangement is to be negotiated. This discrepancy could lead to disputes over the appropriate compensation amount.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "The initial statement indicates that the agreement can be terminated at any time without penalty, provided 60 days written notice is given. However, the subsequent sentence introduces a penalty if the Sponsor terminates the agreement within the first year. This directly contradicts the earlier statement about termination without penalty, creating confusion about the actual terms of termination. The phrasing suggests that the 60-day notice period applies to both scenarios, but the penalty clause creates an exception.",

Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section presents conflicting limitations on Domini's liability for subcontractors. It states that Domini's responsibility is limited to the extent of the subcontractor's liability insurance coverage. However, it then adds that Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services. If a subcontractor's actions are outside the scope of contracted services, then their insurance might not cover it; if there is no insurance coverage, then the first statement says that Domini has no responsibility, but the second statement emphasizes it further. It creates ambiguity about when and to what extent Domini is liable for subcontractors' actions. It's unclear if Domini's liability extends to the full amount of the damages caused by the subcontractor's actions (up to the insurance coverage limit) or if it is limited to only those acts within the scope of the subcontracted services.",

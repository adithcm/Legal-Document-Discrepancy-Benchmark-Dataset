        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section creates ambiguity and potential contradiction concerning Domini's liability for subcontractors.  While Domini is permitted to subcontract, limiting its responsibility to the subcontractor's insurance coverage creates a loophole. It implies Domini has *no* responsibility beyond the subcontractor's insurance, even if Domini was negligent in selecting or overseeing the subcontractor.  This contradicts the general legal principle that a company is responsible for the actions of its agents and contractors, particularly if it fails to exercise reasonable care in their selection or supervision.",

        "section": "However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This sentence introduces a potential structural flaw and ambiguity in the termination clause.  It implies that the penalty applies *only* if the Sponsor terminates within the first year.  It doesn't specify what happens if the Trust terminates within the first year, leaving that situation unaddressed. Also it states the average management fee, but this is only charged after an amount of time, which is not stated in the agreement.",

        "explanation": "This liability clause is ambiguous because it uses a string of terms that have varying legal interpretations and overlaps (willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, reckless disregard). While intending to limit liability, the lack of clear definitions could create confusion. For example, it is not clear what the difference is between 'gross negligence' and 'reckless disregard'. Also, it states that the sponsor shall not be liable for any mistake of law, but this could be considered an error of judgement. ",

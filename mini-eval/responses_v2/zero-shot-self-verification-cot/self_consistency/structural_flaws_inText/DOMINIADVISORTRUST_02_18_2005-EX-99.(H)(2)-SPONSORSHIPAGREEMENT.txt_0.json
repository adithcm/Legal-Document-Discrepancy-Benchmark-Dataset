        "section": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons. Domini's responsibility for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor will be limited to the extent of the subcontractor's own liability insurance coverage. Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services.",
        "explanation": "This section presents a contradiction regarding Domini's liability for subcontractors. It states that Domini's responsibility is limited to the subcontractor's insurance coverage, implying some liability. However, it also states Domini is not responsible for acts outside the contracted services' scope, potentially negating any liability even if the subcontractor has insurance. This creates ambiguity and is an in-text contradiction.",

However, termination by the Sponsor within the first year will result in a penalty equivalent to three months of the average management fee.",
        "explanation": "This section contains a contradiction regarding penalties for termination. The initial statement indicates termination can occur 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty.' However, the subsequent sentence introduces a penalty for the Sponsor if termination occurs within the first year. This creates a direct contradiction.",

        "explanation": "This section is ambiguous in its language regarding liability. While it aims to limit the Sponsor's liability, the use of phrases like 'error of judgment or mistake of law' could be interpreted in multiple ways. Additionally, the exceptions for 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence' are standard but broad, leading to potential disputes over what constitutes these terms in specific situations. This creates an Ambiguity in text.",

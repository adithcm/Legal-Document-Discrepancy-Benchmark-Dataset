        "explanation": "The definition of 'Accuray Regions' is ambiguous because it includes 'India' in the definition of 'EIMEA', while excluding it in 'APAC'.

To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the  terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be  bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.

        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the text. The statement 'Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval' implies a rejection if no action is taken. However, the following sentence, 'Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized representative of Accuray' implies that acceptance requires explicit execution/approval. This inconsistency creates confusion as to whether a lack of response constitutes rejection or if explicit execution is always required for acceptance.",

This section omits the specifics of determining when the Service Agreement is between Accuray and the Customer versus Accuray and the Distributor. While it references Section 4.8, simply pointing to another section without clearly stating the conditions creates ambiguity and an in-text contradiction.

Distributor  may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's  reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray  shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra  insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the  need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray,  if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if  a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses  required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was  October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency concerning responsibility for expedited shipping costs. The core statement asserts Accuray covers these costs if the delivery deadline is at least six months post-Purchase Order submission. However, the subsequent example creates ambiguity. It states if a Purchase Order is submitted June 1 with a delivery date of December 1, Accuray bears the expedited costs. But, if the delivery date is October 1, the Distributor pays. December 1 is six months exactly from June 1, implying Accuray *might not* pay in this circumstance. The ambiguity of 'at least' is the issue.

Notwithstanding Section 10.1, the foregoing states the entire  liability of Accuray with respect to infringement of patents or other proprietary rights by the Products or part thereof, or by their  operation. To remove all doubt, Accuray has no obligation regarding any claim based on any of the following: (a) modification of  the Products by any person other than Accuray; (b) combination, operation or use of the Products with other products, parts,  components, materials or accessories not provided by Accuray; or (c) infringement by a product not manufactured by Accuray.",

Section 10.1 describes Accuray's indemnity obligations, and the purpose of including this line is unclear, especially as the list of obligations in the section are presented as options. It creates confusion and an in-text contradiction by suggesting a limitation on Accuray's liability *beyond* what is already stated in the section itself, and in direct contradiction of what the numbered list says, potentially weakening the distributor's protection against third-party claims.

The parties expressly  agree that CONSULTANT may  permit [*****] the use of CONSULTANT'S  name and/or likeness in [*****] print and/or television advertisement provided that this is executed in a manner consistent with [*****] past  [*****] advertising practice using similarly situated professional golfers  with competing golf club endorsement agreements that include [*****]. If  [*****] use of CONSULTANT  varies from past practice of utilizing similarly situated professionals, CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]. If CONSULTANT participates directly in any [*****] sponsored photo shoots for advertising or PR, CONSULTANT shall wear his ADAMS GOLF [*****]. The parties further expressly agree that CONSULTANT'S endorsement of the [*****] shall not include the right to place a [*****] logo on his ADAMS GOLF [*****] or the ADAMS GOLF  [*****]. If CONSULTANT'S relationship with [*****] terminates during this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall be permitted to replace the [*****] endorsement with another [*****] endorsement under the same terms and conditions expressed herein.",
        "explanation": "Section 4.D introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of the Consultant's permitted endorsement of [*****]. The numerous redactions obscure the specifics of what is allowed and what constitutes a deviation from 'past advertising practice.' The phrase 'CONSULTANT will take action to remedy the situation [*****]' is especially vague, failing to specify the required actions. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to enforce this clause and determine whether the consultant is in compliance. Furthermore, it is unclear how to determine the 'past practices' and how to define 'similarly situated professionals'.",

The clause provides an exception to the exclusivity clauses but the redactions obscure the specific circumstances under which the consultant is not required to wear Adams Golf apparel in ads.

        "explanation": "The redaction obscures which clubs the consultant can use other than ADAMS GOLF clubs, This creates ambiguity. While a putter is specifically mentioned, the initial redacted portion could encompass other types of clubs, leading to potential disagreements over what is permissible.

        "explanation": "The redaction prevents a determination of what the minimum number of tournaments are that the consultant is required to play in. This creates ambiguity regarding the consultant's obligations and the circumstances under which repayment would be triggered. Without this number, it is impossible to enforce the repayment provision effectively. The term satisfactory record of play is ambigious.

ADAMS GOLF  shall  reimburse CONSULTANT  for reasonable travel expenses for CONSULTANT when making special appearances for ADAMS GOLF pursuant to this paragraph but ADAMS GOLF shall not pay CONSULTANT session fees, residual payments or the like for television appearances. Travel expenses shall include jet fuel or first-class round-trip airfare and lodging, meals and local transportation.",
        "explanation": "The redaction hides the maximum number of days the consultant is required to make himself available for promotional appearances.

        "explanation": "The redactions in Section 18 create significant ambiguity regarding the contract's financial terms. The end date of the compensation period and the amount to be paid are both redacted, making it impossible to determine the total compensation and the payment schedule.

        "explanation": "The redactions related to the annual bonus caps introduce ambiguity. Without knowing the cap amounts for each year, it is impossible to determine the maximum potential compensation for the consultant.

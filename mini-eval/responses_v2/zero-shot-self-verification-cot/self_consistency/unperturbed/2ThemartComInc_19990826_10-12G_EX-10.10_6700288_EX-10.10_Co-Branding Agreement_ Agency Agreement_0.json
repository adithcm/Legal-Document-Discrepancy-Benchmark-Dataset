        "section": "The term of this Agreement shall continue for one (1) year following the Launch Date, unless earlier terminated as provided herein. This Agreement may be renewed for any number of successive one (1) year terms by mutual written agreement of the parties prior to the conclusion of the term of this Agreement.  <*$p$*>A party wishing to renew this Agreement shall give the other party notice thereof no less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the term then in effect.  In the event that either party does not give such notice, the term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for another one (1) year.",
        "explanation": "There is conflicting language in this section. It states that the agreement may be renewed for successive one-year terms by mutual written agreement, but it also states that if a party does not provide notice of non-renewal 30 days before expiration, the agreement is automatically renewed. This creates a contradiction because it is not clear if a written agreement is always needed to renew, or if it is only needed to renew if one party provides notice of non-renewal.",

        "section": "Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of a party (a \"force majeure event\"), the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference.  However, if a force majeure event interferes with the operation of this Agreement for sixty (60) days or more, either party can terminate this Agreement, without penalty. <*$p$*> Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any force majeure event shall not limit either party's obligations under Section 9 with respect to any third party claim as to which the other party seeks indemnification.",
        "explanation": "This section creates a contradiction because it allows for termination of the agreement due to a force majeure event after 60 days, but then states that a force majeure event does not limit obligations under Section 9 (Indemnification). Indemnification obligations could arise from the very force majeure event that allows for termination, creating a situation where a party is still liable for indemnification even after the agreement is terminated due to the force majeure event. This contradiction makes the implications of force majeure unclear.",

        "explanation": "The structure of the sentences in this section is poor and makes it difficult to comprehend. The sentences are long, convoluted, and combine multiple conditions (mutual agreement and automatic renewal based on lack of notice) in a way that reduces clarity. A simpler and more direct structure would improve readability.",

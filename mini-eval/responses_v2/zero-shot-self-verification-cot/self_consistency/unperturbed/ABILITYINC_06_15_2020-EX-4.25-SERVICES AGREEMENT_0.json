        "section": "Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider.",
        "explanation": "This clause seems to restrict the Provider Representatives from offering any services to the Provider itself, which seems like an unreasonable requirement. Provider Representatives are still technically employees of the provider, and as such, should be able to provide services for their employer.",

        "explanation": "This section lacks specifics about the nature and extent of the Recipient's usage rights regarding '[ * * * ]'. Without these details, disputes could arise over permissible uses, access limitations, or maintenance responsibilities. The ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce the provision effectively and opens the door to potential disagreements.",

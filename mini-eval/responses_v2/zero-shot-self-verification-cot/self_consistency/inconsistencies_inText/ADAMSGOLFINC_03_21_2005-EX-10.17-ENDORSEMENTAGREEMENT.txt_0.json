        "section": "In each and every calendar year of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall achieve a satisfactory record of play in a minimum of [* ****] professional golf association events on the SPGA and/or PGA tour (which shall include both the PGA and SPGA Tour Skins Games). If for any reason, CONSULTANT should achieve a satisfactory record of play in less than [*****] SPGA and/or PGA tour events in a calendar year, he shall repay ADAMS GOLF an amount per event for each event under [*****] achieved in the given calendar year as follows:\nThe agreed upon repayment amount per event per calendar year:\n1.

If a resolution can not be reached, ADAMS GOLF may, at its sole discretion, demand prorated repayment pursuant to the repayment schedule in paragraph 8A above.",
        "explanation": "The text states that the consultant must achieve a satisfactory record of play. This introduces ambiguity as there are no parameters to define what a satisfactory record of play looks like. The first sentence states the consultant must play in a minimum number of events, but the term 'satisfactory' indicates a qualitative aspect that could be interpreted in multiple ways. Further, section 8C introduces the possibility of prorated repayment if the consultant is prevented from competing for reasons outside his control. This contradicts the earlier statement that the consultant must repay a certain amount if they play in less than the minimum number of events because the prorated repayment for reasons outside of his control may not be the same amount as if he willingly chose to not play.",

        "explanation": "The phrase 'reasons outside his control' is a vague term. It creates an ambiguity because it is unclear which reasons would qualify as 'outside his control'. This can be seen as a legal contradiction because it is difficult to determine which circumstances would trigger the prorated repayment, potentially leading to disputes.",

        "explanation": "The first sentence establishes that the base compensation is for the entire term of the agreement but the second sentence says the compensation will be paid upon completion of each calendar year of the contract. This introduces a contradiction in text. The first sentence suggests a lump-sum payment at the end of the entire agreement term, while the second sentence implies annual payments.

        "explanation": "The terms of payment are not clear.

It states that the breaching party has thirty (30) days to rectify the breach, but also states they have fifteen (15) days written notice of such cause. The phrase 'thirty (30) day period' suggests that the termination becomes effective 30 days after the notice, regardless of whether the breach is rectified.

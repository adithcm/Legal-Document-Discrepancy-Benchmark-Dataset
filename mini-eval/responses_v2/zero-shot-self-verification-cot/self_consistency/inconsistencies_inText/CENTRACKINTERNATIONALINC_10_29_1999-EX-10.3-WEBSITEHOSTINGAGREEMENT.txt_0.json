        "explanation": "This section creates an ambiguity because it states that i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays. However, it follows that statement by saying that this is with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will schedule and perform such maintenance during any time of the day, including weekdays. This is an ambiguity because it suggests that although i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, they do not have to maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously. There is no clear language as to when the reasonable hardware and software maintenance will take place. Therefore, that introduces multiple interpretations.",

        "explanation": "This section has a structural flaw within the text.

The next statement states that the Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 20th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. This is redundant and does not need to be repeated. The third statement goes on to say that the Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.

        "explanation": "This section has an ambiguity in text because it is not clear what is meant by 'timely manner.' The first statement states that the Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450 and the second statement states that the Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 20th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. Because the second statement describes when the payments are due, the statement that the Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site, is ambiguous. Does 'timely manner' mean by the 20th day of each month, or does 'timely manner' mean something else?",

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice.",
        "explanation": "This section presents an inconsistency in text. The first sentence states that the agreement automatically renews for one-month periods unless a party gives notice of non-renewal at least five days before the term ends. However, the second sentence allows either party to terminate the agreement 'at any time' with thirty days' notice. This creates a contradiction: if a party can terminate 'at any time' with 30 days notice, the five-day non-renewal notice becomes irrelevant. It's unclear whether the five-day notice is still required or if the 30-day termination clause supersedes it.",

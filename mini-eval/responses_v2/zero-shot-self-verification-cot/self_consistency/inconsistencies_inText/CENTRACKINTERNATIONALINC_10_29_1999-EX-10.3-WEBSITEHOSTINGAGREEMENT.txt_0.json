        "explanation": "The contract states that the customer is responsible for paying the monthly fees by the 20th of each month beginning April 1, 1999. This is misaligned because the start date of the contract itself is April 6, 1999. This creates confusion on whether the first payment is due before the contract is signed.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than five (5) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.",
        "explanation": "There is an inconsistency in the term and termination clause. The agreement starts on April 1, 1999, and continues for six months, but it renews for one month periods. This suggests that the contract could potentially continue for only one month after the initial six month term, which contradicts the six month term mentioned earlier.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due to i-on and to make such payments on a timely basis.",
        "explanation": "This section contains potentially conflicting statements. While it allows either party to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice, it also stipulates that termination does not relieve the customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due. This could be interpreted in several ways, particularly if the termination occurs mid-month. Does the customer owe only for the services used up to the termination date, or for the entire month, or potentially for the remainder of the original term? The wording is ambiguous and could lead to disputes.",

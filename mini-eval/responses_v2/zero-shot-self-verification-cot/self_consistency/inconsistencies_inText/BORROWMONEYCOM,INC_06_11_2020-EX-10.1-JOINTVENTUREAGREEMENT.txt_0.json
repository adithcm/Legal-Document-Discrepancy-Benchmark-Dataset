        "explanation": "The description of BorrowMoney.com, Inc.'s duties is vague and open to interpretation. The phrase 'HTML code, build, deploy and maintain all technical aspect requirements' lacks specificity, creating ambiguity about the exact scope of their responsibilities. What specific aspects of the platform are they responsible for? What level of maintenance is required? This vagueness makes it difficult to enforce the clause and determine if BorrowMoney.com, Inc. is fulfilling its obligations. Also there is an inconsistency on the JVLS side. It states they will pay $60,000.00 within 90 days, and it will pay 10% of any revenue from awarded contracts 'In Addition to The Total Contributions'. This implies that the 10% of any revenue is to be added to their capital contribution, but this is never specified.",

This is too broad and lacks specific methodology. Revenue can fluctuate, and using only three months might not accurately reflect the true value. Also it's not clear how this revenue translates to a final valuation figure. Does it use a multiple? Are expenses deducted? The lack of clarity creates a significant ambiguity. Additionally, it states that 'A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account'. Given the issues with the Capital Contribution section, it will be difficult to determine the proportion.",

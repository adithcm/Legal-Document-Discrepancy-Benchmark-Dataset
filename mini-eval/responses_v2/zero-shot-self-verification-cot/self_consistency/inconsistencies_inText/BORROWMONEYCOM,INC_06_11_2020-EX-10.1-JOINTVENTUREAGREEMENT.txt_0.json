The rights and obligations of the Members will be as stated in the applicable legislation of the State of Florida (the \"Act\") except as otherwise provided here.",
        "explanation": "This statement introduces ambiguity by stating that the joint venture will adhere to Florida law but then allows for exceptions within the agreement. This creates potential for conflicting interpretations if the agreement deviates from Florida law, especially if those deviations are not clearly defined or are ambiguous. This makes it unclear which provisions, the default Florida law, or the exceptions within the contract, take precedence.",

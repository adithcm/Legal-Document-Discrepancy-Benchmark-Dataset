The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover. <*$p$*>Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The text states that \"The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, except for the fees due to the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, and legal counsel fees which Domini will cover.\" However, in the next sentence, \"Other operating expenses include but are not limited to governmental fees...\" This creates a contradiction because legal counsel fees are part of operating expenses, but the prior statement explicitly stated that Domini will cover legal counsel fees. This is an in-text contradiction because different sections of a contract provide conflicting obligations, leading to ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.",

        "explanation": "The text states that the Trust shall pay Domini a fee at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. The next sentence states that if Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this section, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. The ambiguity arises here because \"any period\" is vague and undefined. It could refer to the entire agreement period, the fiscal year, or even the month. Without a clear definition, disputes could arise over how the fee should be prorated if the agreement is terminated mid-year or mid-month.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"at any time, with the payment of a penalty of $10,000\" introduces ambiguity in text. It's unclear when the payment needs to occur if the Board of Trustees wishes to terminate this agreement. Is the penalty due upfront, when the agreement terminates, or is there some other set time in which the penalty needs to be paid? This ambiguity in text could lead to multiple interpretations and disputes. This is an in-text contradiction because of inconsistently defined terms with the text itself, leading to confusion.",

Terms of the project: 12 weeks from February 8, 2018 to May 3, 2018. However, Company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section presents conflicting information regarding the project's completion timeline. Initially, it states that the company will use its best efforts to deliver the website within the 12-week timeframe specified in the Scope of Work. However, it then claims that the company guarantees completion within 8 weeks, with penalties for delays beyond this timeframe. The discrepancy arises because the first statement sets a target timeframe with no guarantee, while the second statement provides a guaranteed completion time, thus creating an internal contradiction in the project's duration.",

Client shall make a prepayment of $1,900 and pay the remaining $3,100 according to the following milestone schedule: $1,000 upon completion of Stage 1 of the Scope of Work, $1,000 upon completion of Stage 2, and $1,100 upon completion of Stage 3.",
        "explanation": "The opening sentence states that the total price Client agrees to pay is $5,000. The subsequent sentences detail a payment structure that includes an upfront payment of $1,900, $1,000 upon completion of Stage 1, $1,000 upon completion of Stage 2, and $1,100 upon completion of Stage 3. The sum of these payments is $5,000, which equals the total price. There is not any contradiction in the text.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "The surcharge is calculated in two different ways: The first way is the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%). Twenty-five percent of $40 is $10, so $40 + $10 = $50. The second way is a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower. $50 is lower, so the first calculation is valid. However, the meaning behind the sentence is unclear. Is the surcharge of $50 or $100 added to the normal price of business hours, or is it the total price?",

        "explanation": "This statement introduces a guarantee of completion within 8 weeks, but the agreement does not specify any penalties for delays beyond this timeframe. This creates a contradiction because it implies penalties exist but fails to define them, making the guarantee unenforceable.",

        "explanation": "The contract states that the 'terms of the project' are 12 weeks from February 8, 2018, to May 3, 2018. This directly contradicts the subsequent statement guaranteeing completion within 8 weeks. The document provides 2 different timelines, thus creating confusion.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be either the standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower.",
        "explanation": "The clause states that the surcharge will be the 'standard hourly rate of $40 plus twenty-five percent (25%) or a flat fee of $100 per hour, whichever is lower'. 25% of $40 is $10. Therefore, the surcharge is $50 or $100, whichever is lower. This creates ambiguity because it is not properly structured, and does not make sense.",

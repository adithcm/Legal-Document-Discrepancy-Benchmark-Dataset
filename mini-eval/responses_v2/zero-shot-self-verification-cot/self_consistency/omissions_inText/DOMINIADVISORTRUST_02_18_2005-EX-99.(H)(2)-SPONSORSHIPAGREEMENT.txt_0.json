The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust; expenses of distributing, issuing and redeeming shares and servicing shareholder accounts; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and statements of additional information, reports, notices, proxy statements and reports to shareholders and governmental officers and commissions; expenses connected with the execution, recording and settlement of portfolio security transactions; insurance premiums; fees and expenses of the Trust's custodian for all services to the Trust, including safekeeping of funds and securities and maintaining required books and accounts; expenses of calculating the net asset value of shares of the Trust; expenses of shareholder meetings; and expenses relating to the issuance, registration and qualification of shares of any series of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "This section outlines the allocation of charges and expenses between Domini and the Trust. The first sentence states that Domini pays the salaries of the Trust's Trustees, officers, and agents who devote time to Domini's affairs. However, the second sentence then states that 'The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor'. This creates a contradiction: Domini pays some Trustee salaries, but the Trust pays compensation to Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor. This implies the Trust would also pay Trustee salaries which contradicts the first statement.",

As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",
        "explanation": "The first sentence contains a legal ambiguity. It states the Sponsor is not liable except for \"willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.\" The phrase \"reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder\" could be interpreted as overlapping with gross negligence. If reckless disregard is proven, does it automatically equate to gross negligence, or is it a separate, potentially lower, standard of culpability? This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the degree of fault required for liability.",

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be determined by mutual agreement.",
        "explanation": "The section refers to a 'mutually agreed upon fee' without specifying where or how this fee is documented. This omission creates ambiguity. Without a clear reference to a schedule or method for determining the fee, enforcing this clause becomes problematic. The agreement lacks clarity on how the 'mutually agreed upon fee' is established and adjusted over time, which is a structural flaw.",

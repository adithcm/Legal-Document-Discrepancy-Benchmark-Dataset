Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform oversight, administrative and management services as requested by the Trust. These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"as requested by the Trust\" is ambiguous. It's unclear whether 'the Trust' refers to the Board of Trustees or to the Trust as a whole, potentially including officers or agents. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes about the scope of the Sponsor's duties. For instance, if an officer requests a service not approved by the Board, is the Sponsor obligated to perform it?",

These services include but are not limited to maintaining office facilities and supervising the overall administration of the Trust.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"supervising the overall administration of the Trust\" is overly broad and lacks specific details about the extent of the Sponsor's responsibilities. Without clear boundaries, it is difficult to ascertain the precise nature of the 'overall administration' and creates ambiguity. What specific administrative functions are included? Who is responsible for more detailed day-to-day administration versus high-level supervision?",

        "explanation": "The initial statement that \"the Trust shall pay Domini a mutually agreed upon fee\" lacks specificity regarding the process of determining this fee. The omission of details regarding how the fee is negotiated, reviewed, or adjusted introduces uncertainty into the agreement. The language implies it will be a mutually agreed upon fee, yet fails to define how that agreement must be put into effect or enforced.",

        "explanation": "While Section 3 states that the Sponsor is paid a mutually agreed upon fee, there is no language describing the consequences if both parties are unable to come to an agreement on a fee. If the parties are unable to agree, then this could cause significant issues for both parties down the line, yet the agreement is silent as to this possibility.",

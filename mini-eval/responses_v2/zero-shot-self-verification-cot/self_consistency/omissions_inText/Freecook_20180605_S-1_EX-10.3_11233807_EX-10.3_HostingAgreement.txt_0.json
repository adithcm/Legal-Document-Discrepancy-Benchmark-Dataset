        "section": "Client agrees to pay to Company to design and develop a website for Client (the \"Client Website\") in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work, attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A' is ambiguous.  The Scope of Work is mentioned, but not physically integrated into the contract. This creates uncertainty regarding the definitive obligations of both parties because the specific details outlined within 'Exhibit A' are not explicitly incorporated, raising the possibility that those specific details are not enforceable. What exactly entails in the scope of work is vague. This makes it difficult to determine the extent of the company's work or what happens if they deviate from what the client expects.",

        "explanation": "This statement lacks clarity and could be seen as ambiguous.  It specifies that 'unsolicited positive feedback' may be used.  However, it doesn't define what constitutes 'unsolicited' or whether explicit consent is needed before using such feedback.  This vagueness could lead to disputes if the client feels their words are being used without their approval, particularly if the 'unsolicited feedback' contains confidential or sensitive information that the client did not expect to be publicized.",

        "explanation": "The condition 'on completion of the Scope of Work' is ambiguous. The document doesn't provide a clear, objective method for determining when the 'Scope of Work' is truly completed. It does not define acceptance criteria.  This introduces the risk of disagreement, where the Company claims the work is complete and demands final payment, but the Client disagrees and believes the work is still outstanding.",

        "explanation": "This section introduces an inconsistency regarding 'rush work' and its associated surcharge. While it states a surcharge applies for work outside normal business hours due to a client-requested rush deadline or the client's failure to meet deadlines, it doesn't clearly define *how* the surcharge is calculated or *when* it will be applied. This lack of clarity could lead to disputes about what constitutes 'rush work' and the amount owed, as the application of the 25% surcharge on the hourly rate could be interpreted differently by each party.",

        "explanation": "This section represents an omission of essential information regarding the level of customer service to be provided. The contract states that Company will provide customer service.  However, it then grants the Company the right to alter or cease providing the customer service 'at its sole discretion' without any liability. This essentially makes the customer service obligation unenforceable and renders the initial statement that customer service will be provided meaningless.  It fails to establish a minimum level or standard of service, potentially violating consumer protection principles if a reasonable level of service is expected but not guaranteed.",

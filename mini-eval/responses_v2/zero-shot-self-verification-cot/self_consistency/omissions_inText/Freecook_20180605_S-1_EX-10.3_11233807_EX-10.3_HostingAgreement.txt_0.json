Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
        "explanation": "The phrase \"addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work\" is structurally flawed and hard to interpret. It's unclear what the relationship between these elements is. Is it that ANY of these things constitute 'Additional Work'? Or is it a combination of some of them? The sentence construction is such that the meaning becomes muddled.",

        "explanation": "The definition of 'Additional Work' includes 'changes to elements which have been finalized'. However, the contract does not define what constitutes 'finalized'. Does this mean finalized by the Company, the Client, or both? Without a clear definition, this term is ambiguous and open to interpretation, potentially leading to disputes about whether a change constitutes 'Additional Work' subject to additional charges.",

        "explanation": "The phrase \"in accordance with the accompanying Scope of Work\" is ambiguous. While it states that the website design and development should align with Exhibit A, it doesn't specify what happens if the Scope of Work in Exhibit A is unclear or incomplete. Does Company have complete autonomy in filling gaps, or is there a process for clarification? This lack of clarity creates potential disputes about whether the delivered website meets the agreement.",

        "explanation": "The contract states that the Scope of Work is 'attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A,' but the provided document includes the Scope of Work on Page 2, without any explicit indication of being attached as a separate exhibit. Although it is included in the document it is not physically attached as stated in the agreement. This contradiction creates uncertainty because the contract specifically refers to it being attached as a separate exhibit",

However, calculating 12 weeks from February 8, 2018, leads to May 3, 2018. This discrepancy creates a conflict because the actual deadline based on a 12-week duration differs from the explicitly stated end date.",

        "explanation": "The contract specifies that the remaining balance of $3,100 is due 'on completion of the Scope of Work.' However, it lacks a clear definition of what constitutes 'completion.' Does it mean when Company believes the work is finished, when Client approves it, or when the website is fully launched and operational? The ambiguity can lead to disagreements about when the final payment is triggered.",

The surcharge for rush work shall be the hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%).",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a surcharge for 'rush work' if the client needs work done outside of normal business hours but fails to define the 'hourly rate'. Without knowing the base hourly rate, the 'surcharge' of 'the hourly rate plus twenty-five percent (25%)' is meaningless and cannot be calculated.

However, the contract later states: 'Company at its sole discretion may at any time alter or cease providing the Customer Service which it has agreed to provide to Client relating to Client Website pursuant to this Agreement without any liability to Company.'

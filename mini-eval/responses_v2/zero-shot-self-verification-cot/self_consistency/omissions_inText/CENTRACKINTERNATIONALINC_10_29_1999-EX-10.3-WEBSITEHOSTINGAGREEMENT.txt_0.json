        "explanation": "The text states that i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, 24/7, but then immediately introduces an exception for 'reasonable hardware and software maintenance.'  However, the agreement provides no definition of what constitutes 'reasonable' maintenance. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine when i-on can interrupt service and for how long without being in breach of contract.",

This omission creates uncertainty about the exact connectivity i-on is obligated to provide.  Without the SLA, the customer cannot fully understand the scope of i-on's responsibility for internet connectivity, which is a key service.",

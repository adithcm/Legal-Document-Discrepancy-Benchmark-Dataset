        "section": "B.\"PRODUCT\" shall mean all golf clubs including, but not limited to, metal woods, drivers, fairway woods, irons and putters.",
        "explanation": "The definition of \"PRODUCT\" includes a non-exhaustive list of golf clubs. While generally acceptable, the phrase \"but not limited to\" creates ambiguity. It's unclear if 'golf clubs' includes only traditional clubs or also extends to related equipment or accessories. This ambiguity could lead to disputes if ADAMS GOLF seeks to extend the endorsement to items beyond the explicitly listed club types. The potential discrepancy lies in the interpretation of the scope of 'golf clubs'.",

        "section": "5. EXCLUSIVE USE OF PRODUCT During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT.",
        "explanation": "This clause, while seemingly straightforward, creates a potential in-text contradiction when considered alongside section 2.C, which defines \"MANDATORY PRODUCTS.\" Section 2.C lists specific ADAMS GOLF products that Consultant 'must exclusively play/use'. However, the redactions in 2.C obscure the precise nature and quantity of these products. This lack of clarity creates a contradiction, since if the MANDATORY PRODUCTS are not clearly defined, then the obligation to exclusively use them is also unclear and unenforceable. This is because the exact parameters of what the Consultant *must* use remains ambiguous, making it difficult to determine if he's in breach of this obligation.",

        "section": "7. CONSULTANT'S SATISFACTION OF MANDATORY PRODUCT It is particularly and expressly understood and agreed that if CONSULTANT shall find in his sincere best reasonable judgment that the MANDATORY PRODUCT so supplied is not suitable for his use in tournament competition, then he shall promptly notify ADAMS GOLF in writing of such fact and the reasons therefor. Thereafter, ADAMS GOLF shall have a period of thirty (30) days to either, at ADAMS GOLF'S sole discretion, supply CONSULTANT with MANDATORY PRODUCT that is acceptable to him or terminate the agreement.",
        "explanation": "This section introduces a level of subjectivity regarding the Consultant's satisfaction with the MANDATORY PRODUCT. The standard is \"sincere best reasonable judgment.\" However, the contract does not define what constitutes \"suitable for his use in tournament competition.\" This lack of clear criteria presents an ambiguity. The contradiction arises because, on the one hand, the Consultant is obligated to exclusively use MANDATORY PRODUCTS (Section 5), but on the other hand, he has the right to reject them based on a subjective assessment of suitability, without a clear standard for that assessment. This could lead to disagreements about whether a rejection is legitimate or an attempt to circumvent the exclusivity clause.",

                "changed_text": "5) Confidentiality \"Confidential information\" shall mean any and all technical and non-technical information, documents and materials related to client projects of party and products, services and business of each of the parties. COMPANY and Bravatek agree to maintain in strict confidence and not to disclose or disseminate, or to use for any purposes other than performance of the projects, the Confidential Information disclosed. The obligation of non-disclosure shall not apply to the following: a. Information at or after such time that is publicly available through no fault of either party b. Information at or after such time that is disclosed to either party by a third party entitled to disclose such information c. Information which is required by law to be disclosed to federal, state or local authorities. 9) Governing Law This Agreement is entered into in the State of Texas and shall be interpreted according to the laws of the State of Nevada.",
                "explanation": "The agreement states that it is entered into in Texas and shall be interpreted according to the laws of the State of Texas. The modification moves the governing law to under the confidentiality section, and changes the state to Nevada. This could cause the contract to be interpreted according to Nevada state law and not Texas state law as initially expected.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Business and Commerce Code allows parties to choose which jurisdiction's laws govern their agreement. By changing the governing law section to a place where it is less discoverable, and by changing the state to Nevada, the parties' intent regarding governing law becomes unclear, potentially contradicting the principle that agreements should reflect the parties' intentions and creating ambiguity that could be challenged in court.",

                "explanation": "Moving the Compensation clause to follow the Modifications clause makes it more likely that it can be overlooked, especially since compensation and modifications are not usually related. This could result in Bravatek not receiving the lead-finder fee, especially since the text also contains the verbiage \"to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY\".",

Provide timely responses to both technical and administrative questions posed by Bravatek. c. Promote Bravatek's product and service offerings whenever possible. d.

                "explanation": "Moving the indemnification clause to follow the duties of the company puts it into a section where one party might not expect it to be. Indemnification clauses are meant to protect both parties, and this move makes it harder to find for Bravatek.",

As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.",

The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.",
                "explanation": "By changing the order of sentences in Section 4, the initial emphasis is shifted from the Sponsor's limitation of liability to a definition of who constitutes the 'Sponsor.' This could obscure the critical limitation of liability clause, affecting its prominence and potentially impacting its enforceability.",

By obscuring the liability limitation within a definitional statement, it may be argued that the clause is less clear and conspicuous, potentially running afoul of the spirit, if not the letter, of ยง17(h) which aims to ensure that fund managers and sponsors are held accountable for misconduct and that investors are not misled by overly broad liability waivers.",

                "explanation": "By separating the phrase 'without the payment of any penalty' from the main clause regarding termination, the reader's understanding of the termination terms may be affected. This separation introduces ambiguity as it may lead to disputes over whether penalties are indeed waived upon termination. The original text links the lack of penalty to termination, now it's a separated statement.",

By creating a clause where it isn't clear that there is no penalty on termination, it opens the door to deceptive practices. The wording could confuse a reasonable consumer into thinking that penalties may exist. This could be deemed a violation of consumer protection laws requiring clear and unambiguous contract terms.",

By removing telecopy as an acceptable method of communication, this may contradict provisions allowing for electronic transmission of documents, especially if telecopy is commonly used in the relevant industry and considered an electronic record. Denying telecopy could unfairly disadvantage a party reliant on electronic communication, contradicting the principles behind UETA of placing electronic transactions on the same footing as paper-based transactions.",

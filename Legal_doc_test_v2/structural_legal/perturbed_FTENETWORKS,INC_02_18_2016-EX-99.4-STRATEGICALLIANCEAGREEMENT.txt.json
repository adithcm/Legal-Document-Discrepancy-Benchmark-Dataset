In addition, EDGE exercise of such right is for EDGE' benefit alone and shall confer no rights to Subcontractor or to any third party. EDGE's acceptance of or failure to object to the submitted documents does not constitute approval of coverage that is not in compliance with this Agreement or as acceptance or affirmation of the adequacy or applicability of such insurance.",

                "explanation": "The relocation of the clause regarding submitting insurance certificates and policies introduces ambiguity. By placing the acknowledgement of EDGE's review rights before the requirement to submit documentation, it suggests that submission is contingent or less critical, weakening the enforceability of the insurance requirements.",

Under Texas law, as outlined in the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 35.51, clear and unambiguous forum selection clauses are generally enforceable. Moving it to a section about 'number and gender' can obscure the intent and enforceability of the clause, making it less likely to be upheld in court because it's not prominently placed where parties would reasonably expect to find such a critical term.",

The Texas Property Code § 53.056 protects the rights of contractors and subcontractors to file liens on properties where they have provided labor or materials. Relocating the lien waiver to the independent contractor section misrepresents its scope. A clear and conspicuous waiver is required, but this change implies the waiver is tied *only* to the independent contractor relationship, not to payment for services, undermining the protections intended by the Texas Property Code. If the subcontractor is not paid, the placement could mislead them into thinking their independent contractor status prevents them from filing a lien.",

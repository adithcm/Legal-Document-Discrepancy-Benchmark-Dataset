The parties understand that work i-on does in the development and maintenance of Web content and applications for Centrack International is governed by separate agreement(s). Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed to create a joint venture or partnership between the Customer and i-on. Neither party is, by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, authorized as an agent or legal representative of the other party. Neither party is granted any such right or authority to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of the other party or to bind such other party in any manner. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of either party hereunder shall be effective, except pursuant to a written instrument signed by the party or parties waiving compliance, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose stated in such writing. In the event that any provision hereof is found invalid or unenforceable pursuant to judicial decree or decision, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. This Agreement was entered into in the State of Florida, and its validity, construction, interpretation, and legal effect shall be governed by the laws and judicial decisions of the State of Florida applicable to contracts entered into and performed entirely within the State of Florida. Neither the Customer nor i-on shall be deemed in default if its performance or obligations hereunder are delayed or become impossible or impractical by reason of any act of God, war, 5 fire, earthquake, labor dispute, sickness, accident, civil commotion, epidemic, act of government or government agency or offices, or any other cause beyond such party's control.\n\ni-on will not be liable under any circumstances for any lost profits or other consequential damages, even if i-on has been advised as to the possibility of such damages. i-on's liability for damages to the Customer for any cause whatsoever, regardless of the form of action, and whether in contract or in tort, including negligence, shall be limited to one (1) month's fees and the remaining portion of any prepaid fees.",

The Customer acknowledges that data loss is a possibility, even with mirrored computer storage and archival backup of such storage as provided by i-on per this Agreement, and agrees to hold i-on harmless for any such data loss for the Hosted Site, provided that i-on maintains reasonable steps as described in this Agreement to protect against such data loss. The Customer shall use i-on's resources in a manner that is clearly consistent with the purposes of the products and services offered. The Customer shall comply with applicable laws, standards, policies, and procedures. The Customer incurs the responsibility to determine what restrictions apply and to review the policies and procedures that will be updated continually. The customer is responsible to use the resources with sensitivity to the rights of others. Any conduct by the Customer that in i-on's sole discretion restricts or inhibits any other user, whether a customer of i-on or a user of any other system, from using and enjoying any of i-on's services is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, the posting or transmitting on or through any of i-on's services, any information that is, in i-on's sole discretion, unlawful, obscene, threatening, abusive, libelous, or harmful, or encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any local, state, national, or International law.\n\nINDEMNIFICATION The Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless i-on, against any lawsuits, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) to which i-on may become subject related to or arising out of Customer's use of i-on's services, and will reimburse i-on for all legal and other expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in connection with investigating, defending, or settling any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action, or proceeding whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation in which i-on is a party.

A court might view the relocation as an attempt to obscure the indemnification obligation, making it more difficult for i-on to enforce against the Customer.

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due to i-on and to make such payments on a timely basis.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE i-on expressly assumes no responsibility of the proper operation or maintenance of any of the Centrack site software that we authored by Imaginet and/or other third parties.",

If the disclaimer is deemed not sufficiently conspicuous, Florida's implied warranty of merchantability (672.314) could be argued to still apply, even though i-on intended to disclaim responsibility for third-party software. The inconspicuous placement makes it harder to enforce the disclaimer, creating a potential contradiction between i-on's intent and the UCC.",

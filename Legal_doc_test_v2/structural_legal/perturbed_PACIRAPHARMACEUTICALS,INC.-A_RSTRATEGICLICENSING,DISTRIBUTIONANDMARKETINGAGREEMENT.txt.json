The original text ensures the company acknowledges and complies with this obligation to these specific programs, whereas the modified version is vague and could be interpreted as excluding them.",

Removing 'Applicable Laws' from the sentence creates ambiguity and undermines the explicit commitment to legal compliance. This contradicts the requirements of 21 U.S.C. § 351, which defines adulterated drugs and devices and mandates adherence to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations to prevent adulteration. By omitting the need to comply with applicable laws, the altered text creates a scenario where EKR might not adhere to the necessary CGMP standards, potentially leading to the distribution of adulterated drugs, which is in direct violation of the cited law.",

The original text ensures PPI's full cooperation with EKR in interactions with regulatory bodies, including the FDA, to facilitate product development and distribution. By removing the explicit commitment to cooperate in FDA-related interactions, the modified text undermines the assurance of collaborative effort. This could impede EKR's ability to provide the FDA with all necessary data, information, and responses during the NDA approval process. This lack of cooperation could lead to delays or rejection of the application, directly conflicting with the regulatory requirements for NDA approval under 21 CFR § 314.50(d)(5).",

                "explanation": "The arbitration clause is moved below the confidentiality clause. Although it is still present, this relocation obfuscates its importance and makes it less readily apparent to a party reviewing the contract, making the arbitration agreement harder to enforce. Furthermore, the renumbering makes understanding the order of operations in the contract more difficult.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 16 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China states that a contract is established when one party accepts the offer from another party. Moving the arbitration clause after a non-substantive clause like confidentiality could be argued as disrupting the clear sequence of contract formation elements, potentially leading to disputes about whether the arbitration clause was properly accepted as part of the core agreement. The relocation makes it harder to argue acceptance of the arbitration agreement as a core term.",

                "explanation": "By interposing the 'Force Majeure' clause between the 'Guarantee of Quality' and 'Claims' clauses, the logical flow of quality guarantees to the process for making claims is disrupted.

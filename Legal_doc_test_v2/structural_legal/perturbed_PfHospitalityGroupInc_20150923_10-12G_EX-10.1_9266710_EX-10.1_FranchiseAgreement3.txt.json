Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5. Delay. No delay or failure by the Franchisor or Franchisee to exercise any right under this Agreement, and no partial or single exercise of that right, shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right provided herein, and no waiver of any violation of any terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any succeeding violation of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 3. Injunctive Relief. Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement. 4. Severability. All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable.",
                "explanation": "Moving the Injunctive Relief clause to the 'Delay' section buries a critical remedy within a less relevant clause, potentially obscuring its importance and impact on enforcement. The legal right to injunctive relief and associated fee recovery are best highlighted in a section dedicated to remedies and consequences of breach of contract, not in a clause discussing delays.",

                "law_explanation": "FRCP 65 outlines the requirements and procedures for obtaining a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order. By obscuring the Injunctive Relief clause within a section about 'Delay', the contract makes it more difficult for a party to quickly and easily understand its rights and the process for seeking injunctive relief, potentially hindering their ability to meet the procedural requirements outlined in FRCP 65.",

All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain.",

                "explanation": "Relocating the definition of 'Confidential Information' to the section addressing 'Delay' disrupts the logical flow and understanding of the contract. The scope and restrictions surrounding confidential information are no longer readily apparent, making it difficult to ascertain the obligations regarding trade secrets.

                "law_explanation": "UTSA § 1(4) defines what constitutes a trade secret. By moving the clause that defines 'Confidential Information' to the 'Delay' section, a court might question whether the definition was properly disclosed and agreed upon, potentially weakening the claim that the information qualifies as a trade secret under UTSA. The law requires reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy; hiding the definition hinders the ability to demonstrate such efforts.",

                "explanation": "Shifting the severability clause to the end of the document, directly after the third-party beneficiary clause reduces the immediate visibility and prominence of this key provision. It is now outside the core operating terms and obligations, leading to a less clear understanding of how the agreement's components are protected and how to determine the validity of its operating terms.",

                "law_explanation": "Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 184 outlines the principle of severability, which addresses the enforceability of a contract when a portion of it is deemed invalid. By placing the severability clause after the 'Third-Party Beneficiary' section, it may imply a potential conflict or limit to that severability, even though no such explicit limitation is given. It suggests it's not of paramount importance. This misplaced emphasis makes it harder to clearly establish the intent to preserve the contract's validity to the greatest extent possible, contradicting the principle that a contract should be interpreted in a way that renders it valid and enforceable.",

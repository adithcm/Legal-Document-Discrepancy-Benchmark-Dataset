The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares. Integrity may, but shall not be obligated to, propose from time to time such amendment or amendments to any registration statement and such supplement or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information as, in the light of future developments, may, in the opinion of Integrity's counsel, be necessary or advisable.

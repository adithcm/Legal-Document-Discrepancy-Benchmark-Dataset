COMPANY and Bravatek agree to maintain in strict confidence and not to disclose or disseminate, or to use for any purposes other than performance of the projects, the Confidential Information disclosed.",

COMPANY and Bravatek agree to endeavor to maintain in confidence and avoid disclosure or dissemination of the Confidential Information disclosed.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agree to maintain in strict confidence' to 'endeavor to maintain in confidence' weakens the obligation, making the protection of confidential information less stringent and more discretionary. Replacing 'not to disclose' with 'avoid disclosure' further reduces the binding nature of the confidentiality clause.",

                "law_explanation": "The Texas Trade Secrets Act requires a showing of misappropriation, which is facilitated when companies have clear obligations to protect trade secrets. Changing the language from 'maintain in strict confidence' to 'endeavor to maintain in confidence' and from 'not to disclose' to 'avoid disclosure' makes it more difficult to prove misappropriation because it introduces ambiguity about the level of care required and whether a breach occurred. The original agreement mandates specific action, while the modified version provides leniency.",

The parties agree to take all steps reasonably necessary and appropriate to ensure that their employees, agents, and/or assistants treat all information as confidential and to ensure that such employees, agents, and/or assistants are familiar with and abide by the terms of this Agreement.",

The parties may take some steps to encourage their employees, agents, and/or assistants to treat information as confidential.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall treat' to 'should consider treating,' 'take every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts' to 'may take some precautions,' and 'agree to take all steps reasonably necessary' to 'may take some steps to encourage,' the legally binding obligation to protect confidential information is significantly weakened and becomes discretionary.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Business and Commerce Code § 5.001 defines good faith as 'honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned'. The original clause requires acting to protect confidentiality, showing good faith. The modified clause allows for less action, potentially violating the standard of 'honesty in fact', particularly if little or no action is taken to protect confidential information. The alterations can be interpreted as not acting honestly in the transaction's conduct, especially after termination, thereby contradicting that law.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall indemnify' to 'may indemnify' transforms a mandatory obligation into a discretionary one. Removing the specific qualifiers 'negligence or intentional misconduct' and 'breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement' widens the scope to 'arising from actions of COMPANY', but simultaneously makes it difficult to determine when indemnification is actually required.",

                "law_explanation": "Under Texas law (Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 41.001), exemplary damages (punitive damages) can be awarded only if the harm results from fraud, malice, or gross negligence. By making indemnification discretionary for any 'damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities arising from the actions of COMPANY,' irrespective of whether those actions constituted fraud, malice, or gross negligence, the modified agreement implies an agreement to potentially indemnify even when such exemplary damages would not be legally justified. The modification thus introduces ambiguity and a potential contradiction regarding the legally permissible scope of indemnification under Texas law.",

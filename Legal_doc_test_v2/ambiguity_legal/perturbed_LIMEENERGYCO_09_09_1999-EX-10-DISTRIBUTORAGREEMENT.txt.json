                "original_text": "Company shall sell and deliver as provided in Section 2.3 of this Agreement to Distributor on the price terms set forth in this Agreement or as amended from time to time such quantity of Products as Distributor from time to time orders from Company. Company shall promote and advertise the Products generally, at its own expense, and shall furnish Distributor copies at all advertisement and promotional materials.",

Company will attempt to promote and advertise the Products generally, at its own expense, and shall furnish Distributor copies of advertisement and promotional materials, if conveniently available.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear obligation on the Company to sell and deliver products as ordered. The modified text replaces 'shall sell and deliver' with 'shall endeavor to sell and deliver' and 'shall promote and advertise' with 'will attempt to promote and advertise'. It also makes the provision of promotional material depend on availability. This introduces ambiguity and makes the company's obligation discretionary, rather than mandatory.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification weakens the commitment of the company to sell and deliver the products to the distributor, using terms like 'endeavor to' and 'attempt to', which introduces discretion. This could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/1-304), which requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably in its performance and enforcement. This modification allows the company to potentially avoid fulfilling orders or promoting the product, undermining the distributor's ability to succeed.",

                "law_explanation": "The weakening of the promotional obligation via the change to 'should consider promoting' impacts the spirit of the agreement which intends to ensure diligent sales activity, but also potentially undermines a sales representative's ability to earn commissions if actively discouraged from sales, thereby conflicting with the intent behind the Illinois Sales Representative Act, which protects sales representatives' rights to commissions.",

This warranty requires that goods be fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.

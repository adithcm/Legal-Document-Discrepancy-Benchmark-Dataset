                "original_text": "The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "changed_text": "The seller should endeavor to confirm within a reasonable timeframe after receipt of order. If the seller finds the order potentially unacceptable or requires modification, the seller may notify the entrusted party within a suitable period after receipt of the order. If the seller does not confirm orders promptly or provides notice of potential non-acceptance or modifications, the seller might be considered to have potentially accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller possibly accepts, any party can explore cancellation of the order before the two sides fully agree.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'shall be confirmed within three working days' with 'should endeavor to confirm within a reasonable timeframe' makes the confirmation deadline vague. Similarly, 'If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order' is replaced with a weaker 'If the seller finds the order potentially unacceptable or requires modification, the seller may notify the entrusted party within a suitable period after receipt of the order', creating uncertainty around the notification requirements. The phrases 'might be considered to have potentially accepted the order' and 'once the seller possibly accepts' dilute the acceptance criteria. Finally, 'any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed' is changed to 'any party can explore cancellation of the order before the two sides fully agree', which contradicts the original intent of preventing unilateral cancellation. The use of terms such as 'reasonable timeframe', 'potentially unacceptable', 'suitable period', 'might be considered', 'possibly accepts', and 'fully agree' introduce significant ambiguity.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 17 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China states that 'An offer shall become effective when it reaches the offeree.' The changes introduce ambiguity around acceptance of the offer, creating a loophole where the seller can delay confirmation indefinitely, making it difficult to determine when the contract legally becomes effective. The original text ensures a clear timeline for acceptance, while the altered text creates uncertainty and potential for disputes, conflicting with the intention of establishing a binding agreement.",

                "changed_text": "All wooden material of shipping package should be treated according to general guidelines related to Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau of China, preferably by an agent generally recognized by the government where the goods are exported. And the goods may be marked with something similar to IPPC stamps, potentially certified by a somewhat related government agent.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by weakening the mandatory language and specific requirements. Replacing 'must be treated as the requirements' with 'should be treated according to general guidelines' makes the treatment discretionary and vague. Similarly, 'by the agent whom is certified by the government' is weakened to 'preferably by an agent generally recognized by the government', making the agent's certification less certain. The phrase 'And the goods must be marked with the IPPC stamps, which are certified by the government agent of Botanical-Inspection and Quarantine Bureau' is altered to the ambiguous 'And the goods may be marked with something similar to IPPC stamps, potentially certified by a somewhat related government agent', creating uncertainty around the marking requirements and the certifying agent's credentials.",

By using weaker terms such as 'general guidelines', 'generally recognized', 'may be marked with something similar', and 'potentially certified', the modified text contradicts the law's intent of enforcing strict and specific quarantine measures for imported goods, specifically wood packaging.",

                "explanation": "This modification replaces the firm guarantee with a weaker statement of intent. Replacing 'guarantee' with 'generally intend' significantly reduces the seller's liability. Additionally, replacing 'complies in all respects' with 'substantially comply' introduces ambiguity regarding the level of compliance required. This makes it more difficult for the buyer to hold the seller accountable for deviations from the agreed-upon quality and specifications.",

It implies that the seller is responsible for ensuring that the goods meet the agreed-upon standards.

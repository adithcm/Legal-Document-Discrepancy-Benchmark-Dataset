                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not' to 'should endeavor not to' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to protect confidential information.

                "explanation": "The change from 'otherwise approved' to 'may be approved' introduces ambiguity regarding the approval process. Replacing 'shall not' with 'shall generally not' weakens the restriction. Using 'significant interest' instead of 'any other interest' and 'reasonably similar' instead of 'substantially similar' are vague terms. This allows the member to argue that their involvement doesn't violate the agreement.",

                "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally invalidates non-compete agreements. The modified text, with its ambiguities and weakened restrictions, could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent this law by making the non-compete appear less restrictive while still potentially hindering an individual's ability to engage in lawful professions or trades. The ambiguities would lead to court challenges about the definition of the new words added, such as 'generally,' 'significant' or 'reasonably,' which are not present in the original law.",

                "explanation": "The use of 'significant failure,' 'reasonably comply,' 'general requirements,' 'might cause injury,' 'potentially contribute,' 'possibly reasonable,' 'endeavoring to obtain,' and 'serious violation' adds layers of ambiguity.

By making the payment of court costs 'potential' and attorney's fees 'possible', the altered text contradicts the typical awarding of costs to the prevailing party and introduces ambiguity, making the outcome unpredictable and potentially violating the spirit of the FRCP.",

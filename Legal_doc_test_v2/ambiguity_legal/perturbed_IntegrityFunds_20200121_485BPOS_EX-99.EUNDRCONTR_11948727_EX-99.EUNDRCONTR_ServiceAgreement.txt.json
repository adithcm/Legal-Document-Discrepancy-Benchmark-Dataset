                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'shall comply' with 'will endeavor to ensure...generally align' and introduces a subjective 'to the extent Integrity deems practical.' This weakens the legally binding obligation to comply with all laws, making it discretionary and difficult to enforce.",

These reports need not be exhaustive, and the Fund offers no guarantee of accuracy or completeness regarding the content or information.",

Replacing 'shall furnish' with 'will provide, when convenient' and adding 'need not be exhaustive' reduces the obligation to provide comprehensive reports.

Although it does not explicitly mandate indemnification, the introduced ambiguity and discretionary nature of the modified clause could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent the spirit and intent of the Act's investor protection provisions. By making indemnification conditional and subject to the Fund's discretion, the agreement reduces the protection afforded to Integrity, its officers and controlling parties, potentially leading to violations if appropriate indemnification is withheld in situations that would otherwise warrant it under securities laws.",

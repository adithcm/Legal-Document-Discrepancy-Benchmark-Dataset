                "explanation": "The terms 'reasonable judgment' and 'try to avoid' introduce ambiguity, weakening the Consultant's obligation to protect confidential information. This shift from a strict prohibition to a 'best efforts' standard creates uncertainty and potential non-compliance.",

The original text was more aligned to preventing trade secret misappropriation, while the modified text uses the language of 'reasonable judgement' to possibly justify behavior that could lead to misappropriation.",

                "explanation": "This modification replaces the Consultant's obligation to keep the Company advised with discretionary language ('may,' 'as Consultant deems appropriate,' 'generally informed,' 'if Consultant feels it is needed'). This weakens the reporting requirements and creates ambiguity about the frequency and content of communication, undermining the Company's ability to monitor progress and manage the consulting engagement effectively.",

                "law_explanation": "Under Texas law, a breach of contract occurs when a party fails to perform a contractual duty. By changing 'agrees...to keep Company advised' to 'may...keep Company generally informed', the contract becomes too vague for a court to enforce a specific level of communication. This ambiguity makes it significantly more difficult for the Company to prove a breach of contract based on inadequate reporting, as the Consultant has broad discretion over the frequency and content of updates.",

                "changed_text": "Consultant believes that Consultant has no known agreement or obligation that is substantially in conflict with the key provisions of this Agreement, and Consultant will use their best efforts not to enter into any clearly conflicting agreement during the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear certification that the Consultant has no conflicting obligations. The modified text introduces subjectivity ('believes,' 'known,' 'substantially,' 'key provisions,' 'best efforts,' 'clearly conflicting'). This weakens the certification, making it more difficult to hold the Consultant accountable if a conflict of interest arises, and provides loopholes for the Consultant to argue that a conflict was not 'known' or not 'substantially' in conflict.",

                "law_explanation": "By weakening the certification regarding conflicting obligations and introducing subjectivity and loopholes through terms like 'believes,' 'known,' and 'substantially,' the modified text undermines the company's ability to avoid or challenge potentially fraudulent transfers that could occur if the consultant is prioritizing other obligations. This can make it more difficult to recover assets or damages in cases where the consultant's conflicting obligations prejudice the company's interests.",

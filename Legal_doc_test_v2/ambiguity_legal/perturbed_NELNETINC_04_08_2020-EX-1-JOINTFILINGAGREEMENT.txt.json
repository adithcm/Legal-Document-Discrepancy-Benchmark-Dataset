                "explanation": "The change replaces 'shall be responsible' with 'shall endeavor to be responsible' and adds 'to the best of their understanding' and 'only if they have definitive proof that such information is inaccurate.' This introduces ambiguity and weakens the legal obligation for accurate and timely filings.",

                "law_explanation": "The modification contradicts the strict requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically Rule 13d-1, which mandates accurate and timely filings. By introducing 'endeavor to be responsible' and 'to the best of their understanding,' the agreement allows for potential negligence or inaccuracies, undermining the intent of the law to ensure transparency and accountability in ownership reporting. Additionally, definitive proof introduces higher evidentiary standards when the legal standard is ‘knows or has reason to believe’.",

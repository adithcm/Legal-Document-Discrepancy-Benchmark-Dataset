                "original_text": "Valeant shall instruct the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to conduct the Valeant Activities for the Product, and will monitor and audit (in accordance with Valeant's standard practice) the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing so that such personnel conduct the Valeant Activities for the Product in adherence in all respects with Applicable Laws.",
                "changed_text": "Valeant shall encourage the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to conduct the Valeant Activities for the Product, and will, from time to time, monitor the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing so that such personnel conduct the Valeant Activities for the Product generally in accordance with Applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall instruct' with 'shall encourage,' making adherence discretionary rather than mandatory. The replacement of 'monitor and audit (in accordance with Valeant's standard practice)' with 'from time to time, monitor' introduces ambiguity regarding the frequency and rigor of monitoring, and replacing 'in adherence in all respects' with 'generally in accordance with' creates uncertainty and allows for deviations from full compliance.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text contradicts the FD&C Act, which requires strict adherence to regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of pharmaceutical products. By weakening the obligation to 'encourage' instead of 'instruct,' reducing monitoring efforts, and allowing for 'general' rather than 'all respects' compliance, Valeant's activities may not meet the standards for lawful pharmaceutical promotion, potentially leading to the introduction of adulterated or misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.",

                "law_explanation": "The modified text contradicts the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits offering or paying remuneration to induce referrals for services paid for by federal healthcare programs. Patient assistance programs must be structured carefully to avoid violating this statute. By weakening the assurance of full compliance with applicable laws and allowing for merely a 'generally compliant manner', the modified text raises concerns that the patient assistance program could be structured in a way that provides illegal remuneration to induce referrals, violating federal law.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall comply in all respects' with 'shall make reasonable efforts to comply.' The addition of 'encourage' instead of 'require' makes adherence discretionary, and the change from 'comply in all respects' to 'make reasonable efforts to comply' creates ambiguity and allows for less than full compliance.",

                "law_explanation": "The Physician Payments Sunshine Act mandates the reporting of payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. By weakening the compliance obligation to 'make reasonable efforts to comply' rather than 'comply in all respects,' it opens the possibility of incomplete or inaccurate reporting, which is a violation of the Sunshine Act. The shift from requiring compliance to merely encouraging compliance among Field Force Personnel further increases this risk.",

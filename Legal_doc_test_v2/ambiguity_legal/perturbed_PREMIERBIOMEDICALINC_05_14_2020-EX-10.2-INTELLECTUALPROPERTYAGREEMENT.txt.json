Each Party agrees to refrain from, either during period of this Agreement or at any other time thereafter, disclosing, using or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should endeavor to hold in confidence confidential information acquired in the course of this relationship with the other Parties and their associates. Each Party agrees to refrain from, either during the period of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, disclosing, using, or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement, unless business needs indicate otherwise.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees' with 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation to protect confidential information. Adding 'unless business needs indicate otherwise' introduces a broad exception, allowing parties to disclose confidential information at their discretion.

                "law_explanation": "PUTSA provides remedies for misappropriation of trade secrets. By allowing for disclosure based on vague 'business needs', the modified text contradicts the spirit and intent of PUTSA, making it harder to prove misappropriation and enforce the protection of trade secrets, as the 'business needs' exception could be used to justify unauthorized disclosure. Pennsylvania law enforces the protection of trade secrets and confidential information; this ambiguous clause weakens that protection.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be reimbursed in full' to 'should be reimbursed... to the extent that THI finds reasonable' introduces significant ambiguity. THI has the sole discretion to determine what is 'reasonable', potentially leading to underpayment or non-payment of legal expenses.

                "law_explanation": "Pennsylvania law requires parties to contracts to act in good faith. By giving THI sole discretion to determine the 'reasonableness' of legal expenses, the modified text creates an opportunity for THI to act in bad faith by arbitrarily denying or reducing reimbursement, contradicting the principle of good faith and fair dealing in contract performance.",

Felder by Halberd/THI shall not be eliminated, cancelled, or altered in any way, and for any reason, unless specifically directed at the request of Mitchell S. Felder.",

Felder should generally have no obligation and/or involvement in any capital raising activities for THI or Premier at any time and for any reason, absent extenuating circumstances. Further, the 150,000,000 (one hundred and fifty million) stock warrants previously ceded to Mitchell S. Felder by Halberd/THI shall not be eliminated, cancelled, or altered in any way, and for any reason, unless, in the opinion of THI's board, such action is necessary for the long-term financial viability of the company.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall have no obligation' to 'should generally have no obligation, absent extenuating circumstances', Marv and Mitchell S. Felder's lack of obligation is weakened and an unclear condition is added. Similarly, adding 'unless, in the opinion of THI's board, such action is necessary for the long-term financial viability of the company' gives THI's board discretion to alter the stock warrants. This introduces a subjective standard, creating potential conflict.",

Granting the THI board discretion to alter stock warrants based on their opinion of 'long-term financial viability' could violate these duties if the decision is not made in good faith or breaches their duty of fairness to all shareholders, potentially infringing on Mitchell S. Felder's rights as a warrant holder if his interests are not properly considered. The vague nature of the condition allows for potential abuse by the board to the detriment of Felder.",

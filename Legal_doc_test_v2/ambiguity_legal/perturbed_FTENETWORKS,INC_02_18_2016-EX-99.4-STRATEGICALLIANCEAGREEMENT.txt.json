                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply with what they perceive to be applicable laws' introduces ambiguity and discretion, weakening the obligation to adhere to all laws.",

The modified text makes compliance subjective, undermining the mandatory nature of OSHA regulations and potentially leading to unsafe working conditions. The original text requires that the subcontractor follow ALL laws. Modifying the language to only require the subcontractor follow what they *perceive* to be the laws renders the law impossible to properly enforce.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates that the subcontractor obtain ALL licenses and permits. The added clause \"what it considers to be all necessary licenses... that it deems necessary\" weakens this requirement and creates a loophole where the subcontractor can decide what is considered necessary, potentially neglecting legally required licenses and permits.",

                "law_explanation": "The Texas Occupations Code mandates certain licenses for specific professions and businesses.

                "explanation": "Changing 'utmost care' to 'reasonable care' and 'supervision of properly qualified personnel' to 'with personnel' reduces the standard of care and weakens safety measures. Replacing 'dispose of any hazardous materials in accordance with applicable law' with 'attempt to dispose of any hazardous materials in a manner they deem appropriate' introduces a significant ambiguity regarding compliance with environmental regulations.",

Allowing the subcontractor to dispose of hazardous materials 'in a manner they deem appropriate' conflicts with the strict regulatory requirements of RCRA, potentially leading to improper disposal and environmental damage. This language makes it unclear what regulations the subcontractor must follow, and is therefore unenforceable.",

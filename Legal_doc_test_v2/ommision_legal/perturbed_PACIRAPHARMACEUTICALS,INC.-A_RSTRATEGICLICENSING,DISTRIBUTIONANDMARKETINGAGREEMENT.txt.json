                "original_text": "Each Party shall maintain, at its own cost, comprehensive product liability insurance, general commercial liability insurance and business interruption insurance at a level which is reasonable and customary taking into account the nature of the Product but which shall have combined limits of not less than $[**] per occurrence. Such insurance shall be with a reputable insurance company and where reasonably possible (taking into account the availability of such insurance) shall be maintained for not less than [**] ([**]) years following the expiry or termination of this Agreement. During the Term, neither Party shall do or omit to do any act, matter or thing which could prejudice or render voidable any such insurance. Each Party will provide to the other Party evidence of its insurance and thirty (30) days prior written notice of any cancellation of its coverage or reduction in coverage from the requirements stated herein.",

Each Party will provide to the other Party evidence of its insurance.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'comprehensive' requirement, the minimum coverage limit, and the requirement to maintain insurance for a specific period after the agreement significantly weakens the insurance clause. This creates potential legal issues, as standard insurance policies may not adequately cover all risks associated with pharmaceutical products, and the lack of a minimum coverage amount leaves the indemnified party vulnerable. By removing 'thirty (30) days prior written notice of any cancellation of its coverage or reduction in coverage from the requirements stated herein', this introduces a greater risk of not knowing the other party is not insured.",

By removing the mandatory notification, the non-notifying party may suffer damages (lost sales, brand damage) that could have been mitigated by a prompt legal response. The failure to notify hinders the ability to take timely legal action, potentially exacerbating damages and violating the implicit duty of good faith and fair dealing, creating grounds for legal action separate from the initial infringement.",

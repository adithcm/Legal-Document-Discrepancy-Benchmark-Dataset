The modified version drastically reduces this protection by capping the company's liability at the fees paid to the agent, potentially leaving the agent exposed to significant losses from legal claims exceeding that amount.

Severely limiting the indemnification, especially in the context of potential securities law violations, can be seen as a violation of this covenant if the company acts in a way that exposes the Remarketing Agent to risk without adequate protection. The capped liability creates a disincentive for the company to ensure accuracy and completeness of information, potentially breaching the duty of good faith.",

                "changed_text": "Consultant may subcontract any portion of Consultant's duties under this Agreement without any consent required.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for prior written consent from the Company before the Consultant subcontracts their duties. In Texas, some regulations require companies to retain control over who performs work under certain agreements, particularly in sensitive industries. Eliminating the consent requirement introduces legal risk if the subcontractor performs inadequately or unlawfully, potentially exposing the company to liability.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Business & Commerce Code § 2.210 addresses delegation of performance and assignment of rights in contracts. While not directly prohibiting subcontracting, it implies a standard of reasonable delegation with consideration for the other party's interest in having the original promisor perform. Removing the consent requirement weakens the company's control over performance, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Texas contract law, especially if the subcontracting leads to deficient performance or exposes the company to unforeseen liabilities. By removing the clause requiring consent, the consultant can bring anyone and assign work. This could result in the company being responsible for third parties that are unvetted.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the country of Switzerland.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Texas law. By changing the governing law to the country of Switzerland, the contract could be rendered non-compliant with various Texas-specific labor and contract regulations. This is especially problematic given the agreement involves services being performed within Texas. The changed text will cause issues if the agreement is adjudicated in Texas.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Labor Code provides specific protections for laborers performing work within the state, including wage payment regulations, workplace safety standards, and anti-discrimination provisions. By selecting Swiss law, the contract attempts to circumvent these mandatory protections for work performed in Texas. This choice-of-law provision could be challenged as unenforceable to the extent it deprives the consultant of rights and protections mandated by Texas law.",

The number of arbitrator(s) shall be one. The seat of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas. Texas law shall also apply to the extent necessary to fill any gaps created by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgement of the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered into any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or breach thereof, shall be settled by non-binding mediation.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces binding arbitration with non-binding mediation. In Texas, certain claims cannot be forced into arbitration, particularly those involving significant public policy concerns or statutory rights. While mediation is a valid dispute resolution method, removing the binding arbitration clause altogether could contradict state laws that favor arbitration as a means of resolving disputes efficiently, particularly in commercial contexts.",

                "law_explanation": "The Texas Arbitration Act establishes a framework for enforcing arbitration agreements. By replacing binding arbitration with non-binding mediation, the modified text potentially frustrates the state's policy favoring arbitration and may subject disputes to lengthier and more costly litigation, which arbitration seeks to avoid. Especially if the contract dispute falls squarely under what the TAA intends to be handled by arbitration.",

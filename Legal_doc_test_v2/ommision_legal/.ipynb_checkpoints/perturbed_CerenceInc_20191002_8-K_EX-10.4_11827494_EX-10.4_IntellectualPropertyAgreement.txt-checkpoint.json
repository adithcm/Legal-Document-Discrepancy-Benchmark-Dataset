Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or the federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise.",

Each Party consents to the jurisdiction, forum and venue as determined appropriate by the other Party.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit consent to Delaware courts and replacing it with a clause allowing one party to unilaterally determine jurisdiction, the contract violates principles of fair contracting and could potentially force the other party into an unfavorable or inaccessible jurisdiction. This could be seen as a violation of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the chosen jurisdiction has no connection to the contract or the parties involved. This introduces legal risk by making the enforceability of the agreement questionable, particularly if it is challenged on the grounds of unfairness or unconscionability. ",

                "law_explanation": "This modification contradicts Delaware contract law because the unilateral jurisdiction clause undermines the principle of fair dealing by potentially subjecting one party to a forum that is inconvenient, biased, or otherwise prejudicial.

                "law_explanation": "This modification potentially contradicts Delaware law regarding the waiver of jury trials. While Delaware generally permits jury trial waivers, courts closely scrutinize them to ensure they are knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. By deleting the acknowledgement that the clause was 'fully discussed,' the contract weakens the evidence that the waiver was truly voluntary and understood, potentially rendering it unenforceable under Delaware law and Article I, § 4 of the Delaware Constitution, which guarantees the right to a jury trial.",

Any such interim measure (or a request therefor to a court of competent jurisdiction) shall not be deemed incompatible with the provisions of Section 11.02, Section 11.03 and Section 11.04. Until such Dispute is resolved in accordance with Section 11.02 or final judgment is rendered in accordance with Section 11.03 and Section 11.04, each Party agrees that such Party shall continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement and that such obligations shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement that interim measures of protection must be “duly granted by a court of competent jurisdiction” and removing the specific allowance of seeking interim protection to “prevent the destruction or loss of documents and other information or things relating to the Dispute; or to prevent the transfer, disposition or hiding of assets”, the contract now implies a far weaker protection of these measures. This potentially allows a party to pursue interim measures unilaterally without any need for legal oversight, which is not consistent with due process.",

                "law_explanation": "This modification could be seen as conflicting with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The Due Process Clause requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before a person is deprived of property or rights. By removing the requirement for court oversight of interim protective measures, the contract could potentially allow one party to take actions that affect the other party's rights or property without due process, making the agreement vulnerable to legal challenge.",

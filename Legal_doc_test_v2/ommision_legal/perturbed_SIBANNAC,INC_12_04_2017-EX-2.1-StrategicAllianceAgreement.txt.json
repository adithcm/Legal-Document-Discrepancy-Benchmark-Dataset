                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek may receive a lead-finder fee, at COMPANY's sole discretion. The amount and payment terms are subject to COMPANY's approval.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the guaranteed lead-finder fee and makes it discretionary, potentially conflicting with implied contract law principles in Texas, where the contract is governed. Specifically, by removing the minimum and maximum range, and making the fee subject to company approval, it could be argued that Bravatek is not receiving reasonably expected compensation for its services, creating legal risk.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Business and Commerce Code § 2.305 deals with open price terms in contracts. While this contract specifies a *range*, removing this range and making the fee completely discretionary violates the spirit of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts under Texas law, as Bravatek has no assurance of receiving any compensation for its services, rendering the agreement potentially unconscionable.",

Bravatek shall indemnify COMPANY, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of Bravatek or breach of Bravatek of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",

Bravatek shall indemnify COMPANY, its directors, officers and employees, for any damages directly caused by Bravatek's gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding' and limiting indemnification to 'damages directly caused' weakens the protection offered by indemnification. This potentially contradicts Texas law regarding the scope of indemnification, particularly concerning defense costs and liabilities arising from third-party claims.",

Limiting indemnification to 'damages directly caused' may impede such fair resolution by discouraging parties from engaging in good-faith settlement negotiations due to concerns about covering legal expenses, therefore, being a violation of public policy to encourage complete compensation for negligence.",

                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will automatically renew.",
                "explanation": "This removes the clause allowing either party to prevent automatic renewal with 90 days' notice. Under Texas law, such automatic renewal clauses may be challenged if they are not conspicuously disclosed or if they are deemed unconscionable. By removing the notice provision, the automatic renewal becomes less transparent and increases the risk that a party could be bound to the agreement for an extended period without actively consenting, potentially violating principles of contract law related to informed consent and fair dealing.",

                "law_explanation": "The Texas DTPA aims to protect consumers from deceptive practices. While this is a B2B contract, the deletion of the non-renewal clause creates a scenario where one party could be unfairly locked into the agreement without clear and conspicuous notice, which could be construed as a deceptive practice under the DTPA, especially if there's a significant power imbalance between the companies.",

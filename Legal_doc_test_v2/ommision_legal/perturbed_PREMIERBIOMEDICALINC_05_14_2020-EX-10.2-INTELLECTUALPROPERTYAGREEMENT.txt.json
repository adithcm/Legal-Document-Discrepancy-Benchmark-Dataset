If the amount of such charge exceeds the maximum permitted by law, such charge shall be reduced to such maximum.",

The changed text creates a situation where the contract could demand illegal interest and/or late fees, which violates Pennsylvania's legal and financial protections.",

Removing this exception means that even information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party must be kept confidential. This arguably infringes upon the right to free speech and dissemination of information, particularly concerning information that would otherwise be considered public knowledge, creating a legal conflict in Pennsylvania, where the agreement is governed.",

The modified clause infringes on this right by preventing a party from disclosing information that is already publicly available, regardless of how it became public.

While not explicitly outlawing them, Pennsylvania courts scrutinize such clauses to ensure they are not the result of unequal bargaining power or impose an unreasonable burden on one party. By granting Marv Enterprises, LLC the exclusive right to select the venue, the modified clause creates a risk that the selected venue will be inconvenient or unduly burdensome for the other parties, potentially leading to a challenge under Rule 1006(d)(1). This could be seen as an attempt to circumvent the standard venue rules and disadvantage Premier or THI in potential litigation.",

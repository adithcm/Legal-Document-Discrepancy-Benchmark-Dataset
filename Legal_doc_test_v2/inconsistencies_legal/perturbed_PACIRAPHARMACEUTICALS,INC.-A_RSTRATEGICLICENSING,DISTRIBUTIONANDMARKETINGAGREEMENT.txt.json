                "explanation": "Changing the reporting deadline from 10 days to 45 days introduces a potential inconsistency with typical contract practices and requirements for timely disclosure of sales data.

                "law_explanation": "While not directly applicable as the contract is not for publicly traded companies, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act emphasizes the importance of timely and accurate financial reporting. Delaying the provision of sales data to 45 days could be argued as hindering the ability of the distributor to prepare timely financial reports, especially if the data is critical for revenue recognition or inventory management. Therefore, there is indirect contradiction from this law due to the importance of accurate and timely reports in financial settings.",

The FDA requires 'adequate provision' and two days may not be enough to satisfy.",

Although the contract does not directly violate this law, extending the reporting deadline makes it harder for PPI to accurately determine its income tax liability on a quarterly basis, potentially leading to underpayment penalties under 26 U.S.C. § 6654. Making the company late on income payments due to late extraction of the amount owed would be a indirect violation of the law, or at least a scenario where the company would be more likely to violate the law.",

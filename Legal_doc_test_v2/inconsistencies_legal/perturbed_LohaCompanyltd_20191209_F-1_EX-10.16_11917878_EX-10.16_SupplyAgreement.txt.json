                "original_text": "Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.",
                "changed_text": "Within 1 day after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the claim period to 1 day after arrival of goods is likely too short and unreasonable under international trade practices and could be seen as a violation of the buyer's rights to inspect goods and file a claim. This creates unreasonable constraints and doesn't allow sufficient time for inspection.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 38 requires the buyer to examine the goods 'within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances'. Article 39 states the buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity if they do not give notice to the seller 'within a reasonable time' after they discovered or ought to have discovered it. A 1-day period is unlikely to be considered a 'reasonable time' under most circumstances, particularly for complex goods requiring thorough inspection, thus contradicting CISG",

                "explanation": "Changing the timeframe for opening a letter of credit to 90 days after signing the contract could be considered an unreasonably long delay. This might violate standard international trade practice, requiring the buyer to establish financial security promptly.",

Requiring a response within 1 day does not afford the seller a reasonable opportunity to investigate and respond to the claim adequately, potentially breaching this principle of fair compensation based on actual losses.",

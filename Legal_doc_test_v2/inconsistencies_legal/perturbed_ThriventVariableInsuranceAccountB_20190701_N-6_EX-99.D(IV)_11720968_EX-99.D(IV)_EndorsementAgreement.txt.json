                "explanation": "Reducing the payment period for deficiency payments to 10 days may not provide sufficient time for individuals to respond, especially considering potential delays in mail or other communication methods. This contradicts the general principle of providing reasonable notice and opportunity to cure deficiencies.",

                "law_explanation": "Although this statute speaks directly to transfers of property, similar concepts of sufficient time to cure defaults apply to insurance contracts to ensure fairness and prevent unjust enrichment.

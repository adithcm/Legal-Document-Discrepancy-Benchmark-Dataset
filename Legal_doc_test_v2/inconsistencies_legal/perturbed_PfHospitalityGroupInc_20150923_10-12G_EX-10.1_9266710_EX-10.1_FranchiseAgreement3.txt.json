                "explanation": "Increasing the non-compete period to five years may be considered unreasonable and unenforceable under California law, especially without specific justification related to trade secrets or confidential information.

                "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally invalidates non-compete agreements. While narrow exceptions exist (e.g., sale of a business), a blanket 5-year non-compete is likely overbroad and unenforceable in California, especially considering the lack of explicit justification. The original two year non-compete may also be unenforceable but a five year term is significantly more suspect.",

                "law_explanation": "The California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) provides protection for trade secrets. Removing the 'thereafter' clause could be interpreted as a waiver of rights to protect trade secrets after the franchise agreement term, potentially conflicting with CUTSA's intent to prevent misappropriation of trade secrets even after a relationship ends. By only restricting confidentiality 'during the term,' the contract is in conflict with the post-term protections afforded by CUTSA.",

                "explanation": "Removing the term 'reasonable' from 'attorney's fees' and stating 'regardless of reasonableness' attempts to circumvent the court's oversight regarding the fairness and justification of attorney's fees awarded.

By stating that attorney's fees are recoverable 'regardless of reasonableness,' the modified clause conflicts with the court's inherent power and duty to assess the reasonableness of such fees before awarding them. This attempts to contractually bypass the court's oversight, which is against public policy.",

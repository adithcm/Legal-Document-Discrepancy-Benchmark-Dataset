While this contract is between two corporations and it's not explicitly stated that Bravatek is a small business, making the payment term 90 days violates the general spirit and potentially the letter of the law regarding prompt payments to small businesses. It increases the risk of a dispute under the Texas Prompt Payment Act.",

                "law_explanation": "While not a specific statute, Texas contract law requires reasonable notice for termination or non-renewal of contracts. Changing the notice period to 30 days, when a 90-day notice was initially agreed upon, is much less favorable for the party that does not wish to automatically renew and creates a scenario where a party has less time to make arrangements. A court could find that 30 days' notice is insufficient and therefore unreasonable under the circumstances. The Business and Commerce Code Section 2.309 speaks to absence of specific time provisions. Here the time provision has changed, but this law explains the principle in general.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 134A.002 defines misappropriation of trade secrets. While TUTSA doesn't specify a required confidentiality period, reducing it to one year significantly increases the risk of trade secret misappropriation if the confidential information retains commercial value beyond that period. A one-year term might be deemed inadequate protection, leading to potential legal disputes if confidential information is disclosed after that period and causes harm. The determination of adequate time for protection falls into what would be considered reasonable. While this period of time might be valid, it depends on what constitutes a company trade secret. The second URL is to a document related to trade secret protection in Texas, as it is difficult to find an official document specifically stating the need for a certain amount of time to protect trade secrets.

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from Japan to Delaware could create conflicts if the contract's provisions violate Japanese law.

                "law_explanation": "Article 27 of the Act on General Rules for Conflict of Laws (Japan) addresses the choice of law in contracts. While parties can generally choose the governing law, this choice is not absolute and must respect mandatory provisions of Japanese law, especially when the contract has a substantial connection to Japan. By explicitly selecting Delaware law, the amendment disregards potential mandatory provisions of Japanese law that might otherwise apply given the involvement of Japanese companies (Nissin Kogyo Co., Ltd.) and the location of some of the joint venture companies.",

Limiting the period for bringing claims for breaches of IP warranties to one month directly contradicts this federal statute, preventing parties from pursuing legitimate claims within the federally mandated time frame. This limitation is unenforceable and conflicts with federal law.",

                "explanation": "This change makes the amendment effective immediately and sets a 90-day expiration, potentially creating issues. If the VNBJ and VNBZ closings, which trigger specific obligations in the original agreement, do not occur within 90 days, or at all, the amendment could terminate before its intended purpose is fulfilled, leading to uncertainty about the parties' rights and obligations. This directly impacts the underlying conditionality built into the original clause.",

                "law_explanation": "Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 225 deals with the effects of the failure of a condition. The original text establishes the VNBJ and VNBZ Closings as conditions precedent to the effectiveness of specific articles within the amendment. By removing this conditionality and making the amendment effective immediately, the changed text disregards established contract law principles regarding conditions precedent. If the closings do not occur, the amendment's effect would be unclear, potentially leading to disputes about which obligations are enforceable. The Justia Law URL leads to a similar law in New York, which is a commonly cited state in business contracts. It establishes the conditions for summary judgements and is similar to Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 225",

                "changed_text": "1.27 \"Field\" shall mean the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. Additional indications, if any, will not be considered.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Field\" is modified to exclude potential future approved indications for the Product. This creates a legal contradiction, as FDA-approved indications form the basis for permissible marketing and promotion activities. By limiting the 'Field' definition, the contract potentially restricts Valeant from promoting the Product for all FDA-approved uses, conflicting with regulatory mandates.",

                "law_explanation": "This modification could result in the product being misbranded if the promotion does not align with FDA approved indications. Promotion outside of the described 'Field' may violate labeling regulations, which requires approved uses to be clearly defined.",

                "changed_text": "1.61 \"Target Professionals\" shall mean physicians only in the Territory, regardless of other medical professionals' permissions.",
                "explanation": "The definition of “Target Professionals” is altered to restrict it to only physicians, excluding nurse practitioners and physician assistants, etc. This introduces a conflict because nurse practitioners and physician assistants often have prescribing authority granted by state law. Excluding these professionals could limit the promotional reach and impact the agreement's effectiveness.",

                "law_explanation": "Excluding those legally allowed to prescribe may be seen as an attempt to subvert the payments through other means by excluding eligible medical professionals. The exclusion does not support any real world application, so it appears to be fraudulent activity.",

                "explanation": "Modifying this clause to allow remuneration if \"pre-approved by legal counsel\" directly contradicts anti-kickback statutes. Legal counsel approval does not negate the illegality of offering or paying remuneration to induce referrals or purchases, creating potential liability.",

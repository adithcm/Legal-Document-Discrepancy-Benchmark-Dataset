A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites.",

                "explanation": "The modified definition of \"Web site\" restricts its functionality to only static HTML pages, conflicting with the common and legal understanding that a website can include dynamic content, applications, and interactive elements. By stating that a website 'may not exist on a single computer system with other Web sites' introduces a contradiction. Web hosting typically involves multiple sites on one server.",

By restricting the definition of 'Web site' to a static collection of HTML pages and prohibiting co-existence on a single server, the modified contract language contradicts the broad, inclusive definition used in Florida law, potentially impacting interpretations related to computer crimes and data security.",

It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra contribution. The Executive Committee will determine the amount of any extra contribution. It will be based on a subjective evaluation of what is deemed fair. You may only make the extra contribution by a reduction in benefits. If you do not make the extra contribution within 30 days from the date we notify you, the amount will be considered a donation.",
                "explanation": "The terms \"extra payment\" is replaced with \"extra contribution,\" and \"Board of Directors\" is replaced with \"Executive Committee.\" The method for determining the amount changes from \"each member's fair share of the deficiency\" to \"subjective evaluation of what is deemed fair.\" Acceptable payment methods are restricted, and failure to pay results in a \"donation\" rather than \"indebtedness.\" This creates ambiguity about the member's obligations and the society's recourse.",

The statute mandates a fair and equitable assessment based on deficiency, whereas the modified text allows for a subjective evaluation. By modifying the terms for repayment, there is no guarantee that the insurance company will receive the correct amount due to the changes in timelines and what happens if payments aren't made, therefore, violating code 611.03(1)(a).",

According to 35 U.S.C. § 261, patent rights are assignable in law by a written instrument. Making the reversion of rights contingent upon discretion undermines the clear assignment required by the statute.",

Section 1(4) defines a trade secret as information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable. By limiting the scope of 'confidential information', the modified text potentially excludes information that would otherwise qualify as a trade secret under UTSA, making it harder to protect it. The added words creates uncertainty and hinders the full protection intended by the Act.",

                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear calculation for late payment charges based on a defined prime rate, capped by the legal maximum. The modified text makes late payment charges discretionary, contradicting the initial fixed calculation and introducing ambiguity. The late charge is to be determined by market rates, which is arbitrary.",

By making the late payment charge discretionary and determined by a 'lending institution', this modification contradicts the statute, as it allows for potential charging of rates beyond the legal limit without a clear, defined calculation method. The institution could set late payment charge beyond the amount that is legally allowed.",

One full set of technical All wooden material of shipping package must be treated as the requirements of Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau of China, by the agent whom is certified by the government where the goods is exported.",
                "changed_text": "The seller shall not be liable for any damage and loss of the commodity, expenses incurred on account of improper packing, unless explicitly stated in a separate agreement, and any damage attributable to inadequate or improper protective measures taken by the seller in regard to the packing. All wooden material of shipping package will be treated without adhering to any particular requirements from any agency.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts established standards for export packaging, particularly those related to phytosanitary measures for wooden packaging materials. By stating the seller is not liable and by removing any need for the wooden material to be treated, it violates regulations designed to prevent the spread of invasive species. This creates uncertainty as to who bears the risk and responsibility for non-compliant shipments.",

                "law_explanation": "ISPM 15 outlines the measures for regulating wood packaging material in international trade to reduce the risk of introduction and/or spread of quarantine pests. The modified text contradicts these standards by removing the seller's liability for damage due to improper packing and disregarding treatment requirements for wooden packaging materials, thereby risking non-compliance and potential legal ramifications related to international trade and phytosanitary regulations.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the mandatory requirement for specific markings on packages, including handling instructions, contradicting standard shipping practices and potentially violating safety regulations. It introduces uncertainty by making essential information optional, potentially leading to damage or mishandling of goods during transit.

The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1.

The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods arbitrarily. 100% of the system value being shipped will be paid against documents arbitrarily selected. The Letter of Credit shall be valid until 30 days after the latest shipment is effected.",
                "explanation": "This alteration introduces multiple contradictions to standard Letter of Credit (LC) practices. Changing 'irrevocable' to 'revocable' directly undermines the security an LC provides to the seller. The value and timing are now at the buyer's discretion, going against established guidelines that protect the seller. By saying that 'partial shipments are not allowed' makes the LC more restrictive. Finally, reducing the validity from 90 days to 30 days gives the seller less time to ship and receive payment.",

                "law_explanation": "While not a law, the UCP 600 is the industry standard for letters of credit. By making the LC revocable, arbitrary, and only 30 days valid, the LC no longer provides the certainty or standards laid out by UCP 600.",

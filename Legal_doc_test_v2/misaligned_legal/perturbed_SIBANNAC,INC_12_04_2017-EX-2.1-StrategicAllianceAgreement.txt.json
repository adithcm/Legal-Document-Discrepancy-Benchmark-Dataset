                "explanation": "Replacing 'laws of the State of Texas' with 'principles of equity' creates a contradiction. Texas law provides a structured legal framework, while 'principles of equity' are more discretionary and can conflict with statutory law.",

Bravatek shall indemnify COMPANY, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of Bravatek or breach of Bravatek of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",

Bravatek shall indemnify COMPANY, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including attorney's fees and court costs, incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the actions of Bravatek.",
                "explanation": "Changing the indemnification trigger from 'negligence or intentional misconduct' to 'actions' broadens the scope significantly. Under Texas law, indemnity clauses related to one's own negligence must meet specific fairness requirements that are not applicable if based on any action whatsoever.",

Specifically, the agreement, as modified, doesn't clearly state whether indemnity extends to indemnitee's own negligence as required by Texas law. Using 'actions' instead of 'negligence' will render the provision vague and potentially unenforceable.",

CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image in connection with the marketing, advertising, promotion and sale of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT. The term 'endorsement' as used here does not include any implied warranty of the product's performance or safety.",
                "explanation": "By adding a clause that explicitly excludes implied warranty from the definition of 'endorsement,' this contradicts standard legal interpretations of product endorsement liability. Typically, an endorsement can carry an implied warranty that the product is safe and performs as advertised, particularly if the endorser has expertise or influence.",

                "law_explanation": "The UCC implies warranties in sales contracts, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. An endorsement can create an implied warranty that the product is safe and performs as advertised. By stating that the endorsement specifically excludes any implied warranty, the contract attempts to circumvent consumer protection laws and the established interpretation of implied warranties arising from product endorsements. This contradicts the UCC's intent to protect consumers through implied warranty provisions.",

For purposes of termination under subsection B, a 'violation' requires a conviction in a court of law.",
                "explanation": "By adding the requirement of a 'conviction in a court of law' for a violation to trigger termination, the contract conflicts with standard contractual interpretation and potentially with laws related to morality clauses. Many morality clauses allow termination based on conduct that violates laws, regardless of whether a conviction occurs. This change significantly limits ADAMS GOLF's ability to terminate the contract for actions that violate laws but do not result in a conviction.",

                "law_explanation": "Morality clauses in contracts are generally enforceable but are interpreted based on the specific language and the intent of the parties. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 241 addresses situations where a party's conduct impairs the other party's expectation of receiving performance. By requiring a criminal conviction for any violation of law before termination is permitted, the modified contract restricts the enforcement of the morality clause, potentially depriving ADAMS GOLF of the benefit of their bargain if the consultant engages in illegal behavior that damages the endorsement but does not lead to a conviction. This contradicts standard principles allowing termination for behavior that substantially impairs the value of the contract.",

                "explanation": "Introducing conflicting choice-of-law provisions creates ambiguity and potential legal challenges. The contract initially specifies Kansas law for all matters but then carves out intellectual property disputes to be governed by Delaware law. This division is problematic because intellectual property disputes may be intertwined with other aspects of the contract (endorsement, advertising), making it unclear which state's laws apply in complex situations. This creates issues on how intellectual property laws will apply.",

                "law_explanation": "Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 187 addresses contractual choice-of-law provisions. While parties generally can choose the law governing their agreement, such choices must be reasonable and consistent. By specifying Kansas law for the agreement generally but Delaware law for intellectual property matters, the modification creates a conflict and uncertainty. Courts typically prefer a single, consistent choice of law to avoid confusion and piecemeal litigation. This dual choice-of-law provision contradicts the principle of clear and consistent contractual interpretation, leading to potential disputes over which jurisdiction's laws apply to specific issues arising under the agreement.",

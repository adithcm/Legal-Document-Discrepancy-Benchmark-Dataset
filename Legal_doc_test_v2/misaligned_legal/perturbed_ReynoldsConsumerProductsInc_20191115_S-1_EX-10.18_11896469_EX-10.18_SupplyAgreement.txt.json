                "explanation": "Changing \"compliance\" to \"substantial compliance\" introduces ambiguity and legal risk. \"Substantial compliance\" is less stringent, potentially allowing a party to operate while not fully adhering to all laws. This can create disputes over what constitutes \"substantial compliance\" and whether it suffices under the contract.",

                "law_explanation": "The Contract Clause prohibits states from passing laws that impair the obligations of contracts. Changing 'compliance' to 'substantial compliance' weakens the original contractual obligation to fully comply with laws, and impairs the original contractual obligation to follow 'Applicable Laws'. A state law cannot retroactively change the definition of 'compliance' in a pre-existing contract to 'substantial compliance'.",

In addition, if Seller has to file litigation to collect the amount owed and Seller prevails in the litigation, Buyer will reimburse Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in collecting the delinquent amount and accrued late payment fees on the delinquent amount.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the late payment fee to 10% per day and removing the 'reasonable' qualification for collection expenses introduces usury concerns and contradicts legal standards for debt collection.

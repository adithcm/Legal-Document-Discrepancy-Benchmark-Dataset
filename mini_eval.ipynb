If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrator\\u2019s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys\\u2019 fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\",\n",
      "  \"explanation\": \"This section outlines a dispute resolution process that includes both pre-litigation negotiation and arbitration. There's a potential structural flaw because the text implies the necessity of a 30-day amicable solution attempt prior to initiating any legal proceedings, it also contains a carve out for 'seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction'. This could be interpreted as the Complaining Party doesn't have to wait the 30 days to seek legal actions, but inly for injunctive relief. However, it does not explicitly state whether the 30-day waiting period applies before seeking injunctive relief. This could lead to disputes over whether a party prematurely sought injunctive relief without first engaging in the required good-faith negotiation period.\",\n",

      "  \"explanation\": \"This termination for convenience clause is ambiguous because it does not specify what happens to the Sponsorship Fee if the agreement is terminated for convenience. Without explicit language addressing the treatment of fees upon termination for convenience, disputes could arise regarding whether a refund is owed, especially if the termination occurs mid-year. This omission can be classified as ambiguity in text and omission in text.\",\n",

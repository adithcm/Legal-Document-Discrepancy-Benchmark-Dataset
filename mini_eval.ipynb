    "The file is a legal document and you are to check for any discrepancies or contradictions within the file.\n",
    "There are 10 categories when it comes to discrepancies or contradictions:\n",
    "1. Ambiguity in text - Ambiguities in text occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",
    "2. Ambiguity in legal terms - Ambiguities in legal terms occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "3. Inconsistencies in text - Inconsistencies in text also lead to **in-text contradictions** when **different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties**. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.\n",
    "4. Inconsistencies in legal terms - Inconsistencies in legal terms arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "5. Misaligned in text - Misaligned terminology leads to **in-text contradictions** when the contract **uses multiple terms interchangeably without defining them**, leading to conflicting obligations.\n",
    "6. Misaligned in legal terms - Inconsistencies arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "7. Omission in text - Omissions also cause **in-text contradictions** when a **key contractual clause is removed**, but **other sections still reference it**, creating an internal contradiction.\n",
    "8. Omission in legal terms - Omissions occur when a contract **removes essential information**, creating legal loopholes. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract omits **a legally mandated consumer protection**, making it non-compliant.\n",
    "9. Structural Flaws in text - this means that the text is not structured properly and does not make sense.\n",

      "Model: This indemnity clause creates several ambiguities. First, it states that the Guarantor protects the Protected Party from liabilities resulting from the Guarantor's actions, failures, or deceptive statements, but *only* if the Protected Party is considered a 'key agent' of the Guarantor. The term 'key agent' is undefined, making it unclear when this protection applies. Second, it provides separate indemnity obligations: 2TheMart protects i-Escrow from liabilities derived from \"2TheMart Material,\" and i-Escrow protects 2TheMart from liabilities arising from \"i-Escrow Media and/or the Deliverables provided to Patrons.\" The term \"Deliverables provided to Patrons\" is not defined anywhere else in the agreement. This creates confusion as to the scope of i-Escrow's indemnity obligation.\n",

However, there is a contradiction to this outlined rule when it is stated that 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, PVSS shall be entitled to receive a guaranteed payment of $10,000 per month, regardless of the Joint Venture's profitability.' There is an ambiguity because the former section states that no money can be transferred without consent, but this payment completely disregards the other portion of the contract.\n",

This could imply that the original terms dictate that no distributions can occur without consent, or that distributions are determined based on Section 6.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 7.1 Sublicenses. Arizona may sublicense the licenses granted herein to its Affiliates and Third Parties in the ordinary course of business in support of its and its Affiliates business, but not for the independent use of Third Parties, and the Company may sublicense the licenses granted herein to Third Parties, its Subsidiaries, AWP, controlled Affiliates, or any holding company that is a direct or indirect parent of the Company provided there is reasonable justification. Each Party will attempt to ensure that any sublicense that it grants to a Sublicensee is generally aligned with the spirit of this Agreement. For clarity, granting a sublicense shall not necessarily relieve the Parties of any obligations hereunder, and each Party will endeavor to ensure Sublicensees compliance. A licensing Party reserves the right to audit Sublicensees and their compliance with this agreement if any concerns or complaints arise. 7.2 Reservation of Rights. Except as expressly provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement or herein, each Party reserves its and its Affiliates rights in and to all Intellectual Property (including with respect to the use, registration and licensing thereof). 8. OWNERSHIP 8.1 Ownership of Arizona Licensed IP. The Buyer Entities acknowledge and agree that (a) Arizona and its Affiliates own the Arizona Licensed IP (other than the Arizona Licensed Trademarks), (b) AWI Licensing LLC owns the Arizona Licensed Trademarks, (b) neither the Company, nor its Affiliates or its Sublicensees, will acquire any ownership rights in the Arizona Licensed IP, and (c) the Company shall not represent or make any claim that it has an ownership interest in any Arizona Licensed IP. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company shall not file applications to register any Arizona Licensed IP or assist any person in doing the same, or contest, challenge, or otherwise take any action adverse to Arizonas and its Affiliates ownership of or rights in and to the Arizona Licensed IP, or assist any person in doing the same. 8.2 Ownership of Company Licensed IP.

Without limitation to the foregoing, Arizona shall not file applications to register any Company Licensed IP or assist any person in doing the same, or contest, challenge, or otherwise take any action adverse to the Companys and its Affiliates ownership of or rights in and to the Company Licensed IP, or assist any person in doing the same. 8 Source: ARMSTRONG FLOORING, INC., 8-K, 1/7/2019 9. PROSECUTION, MAINTENANCE AND ENFORCEMENT 9.1 Responsibility and Cooperation. As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Buyer Entities, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) for filing, prosecuting, and maintaining all Arizona Licensed IP and Company Licensed IP, respectively, in the licensing Partys name. For the avoidance of doubt, in case either such Party files any new Intellectual Property registration to the extent covering the Licensed IP, such new Intellectual Property registration shall automatically become Licensed IP. However, and for the further avoidance of doubt, the aforementioned shall not apply to new Intellectual Property created by a licensee Party or its Sublicensees separately and independently from the Licensed IP, for example in case of separate and independent technical enhancements or advancements. The Parties shall reasonably consult and coordinate with each other at the other Partys request with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9.1. 9.2 No Additional Obligations. This Agreement shall not obligate either Party to disclose to the other Party, or maintain, register, prosecute, pay for, enforce, or otherwise manage any Intellectual Property except as expressly set forth herein. 9.3 Enforcement. As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Company or Buyer, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to elect to bring a Proceeding or enter into settlement discussions regarding, or otherwise seek to resolve, any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation, or allegations of invalidity or unenforceability, of the Licensed IP. In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, regarding activities that would fall within the Company Field if conducted by the Company, within forty-five (45) days after being notified or becoming aware of such infringing conduct, the Company or Buyer shall have the right to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer. In the event that Arizona elects to bring a Proceeding against any alleged infringer of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks and seeks the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement in such Proceeding, Arizona will take reasonable steps to assist the Company or Buyer in requesting the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement, and pursuing an infringement claim against such alleged infringer. The Company or Buyer, as applicable, shall retain all benefits, recoveries, injunctions or other value derived from such Proceedings instituted by such Party. 10. INDEMNIFICATION 10.1 Indemnification. Each Party (the Indemnifying Party) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their respective employees, 9 Source: ARMSTRONG FLOORING, INC., 8-K, 1/7/2019 directors, officers, agents and successors (collectively, the Indemnified Parties) from and against any and all losses (including all costs, liabilities (including present and future damages), claims and expenses) incurred or suffered by any of the Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising out of, relating to or resulting from (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement. 11. DISCLAIMERS 11.1 Disclaimer. Each Party hereby acknowledges that, except to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, including any representation or warranty regarding the validity, enforceability, or scope of the Licensed IP, noninfringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. 12. TERM 12.1 Term and Termination. (a) Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, the term of this Agreement and the licenses and other grants of rights (and related obligations) under this Agreement shall (i) with respect to the Arizona Licensed Trademarks, be for the Arizona Trademark License Term, (ii) with respect to the Diamond Licensed Trademarks, be for the Diamond Trademark License Term, (iii) with respect to the Phase- Out Marks, be for the term set forth in Section 6.6, and (iv) with respect to Copyrights, Know-How and Patents, be in perpetuity. (b) Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within thirty (30) days written notice thereof provided, however, that if the material breach of this Agreement by the breaching Party is limited to the Licensed Copyrights, Licensed Know-How, the Arizona Licensed Patents, or the Licensed Trademarks, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to termination solely with respect to the affected part of the license (i.e., in such case, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Copyrights or the Licensed Know-How or the Arizona Licensed Patents or the Licensed Trademarks, as applicable). 12.2 Effect of Termination. (a) Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, each licensee Party shall and shall cause all of its Sublicensees to cease all use of the Licensed IP that is subject to such termination (excluding for clarity (a) any Arizona Licensed Patents, Licensed Copyrights or Licensed Trademarks that are expired, invalid or abandoned or (b) any Licensed Know-How that no longer constitutes confidential information). 10 Source: ARMSTRONG FLOORING, INC., 8-K, 1/7/2019 (b) Survival. The following provisions of this Agreement, together with all other provisions of this Agreement that expressly specify that they survive, shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement, in part or in its entirety: Sections 8, 10, 11, 12.2(a) and 13. 13. MISCELLANEOUS 13.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Schedules attached hereto), the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties hereto and supersede all prior negotiations, correspondence, agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between or among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall be expressly understood that the Stock Purchase Agreement shall govern the transactions contemplated thereby as a whole and that this Agreement shall not be construed as an amendment or variation of the Stock Purchase Agreement but rather shall be complemented by and interpreted in light of the Stock Purchase Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with, conflicts with or contradicts any term of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement will prevail. 13.2 Assignment. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including under Section 7.1, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any Party under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party provided, however, that (a) either Party may assign any of the foregoing in connection with the sale or other transfer of the applicable business or assets of such Party or its Affiliates to which this Agreement relates (except that neither of the Buyer Entities may assign any such rights, interests or obligations with respect to the Arizona Licensed Trademarks) (b) Arizona may assign any of the foregoing to one or more of its Affiliates and (c) the Company and Buyer may assign any of the foregoing to one or more of its Subsidiaries, controlled Affiliates, AWP, or any holding company that is a direct or indirect parent of the Company provided that in each case (b) and (c), no assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement unless agreed to by the non-assigning Party. Any assignment or other disposition in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. 13.3 Notices. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) on the date delivered, if delivered personally, (ii) on the third (3rd) Business Day after being mailed by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested), or (iii) on the next Business Day after being sent by reputable overnight courier (delivery prepaid), in each case, to the parties at the following addresses, or on the date sent and confirmed by electronic transmission or confirmatory return email to the telecopier number or email address specified below (or at such other address, telecopier number or email address for a Party as shall be specified by notice given in accordance with this Section 13.3): (a) If to Buyer: 11 Source: ARMSTRONG FLOORING, INC., 8-K, 1/7/2019 c/o American Industrial Partners 450 Lexington Avenue, 40th Floor Attention: General Counsel and Richard Hoffman Email: notices@americanindustrial.com richard@americanindustrial.com with a copy to: Baker Botts L.L.P. 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20004 Attention: Terrance L.

Each Party hereto acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by such Party and that any such breach would cause Arizona, on the one hand, and the Buyer Entities, on the other hand, irreparable harm. Accordingly, each Party hereto also agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by such Party, Arizona, on the one hand, and the Buyer Entities, on the other hand, shall be entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific performance. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Arizona, on the one hand, and Buyer Entities, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific 12 Source: ARMSTRONG FLOORING, INC., 8-K, 1/7/2019 performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, under this Agreement. 13.5 Governing Law Jurisdiction Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, its rules of conflict of laws notwithstanding. Each Party hereby agrees and consents to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, in any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such Action by the delivery of such process to such Party at the address and in the manner provided in Section 13.3 hereof. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13.5(b). 13 Source: ARMSTRONG FLOORING, INC., 8-K, 1/7/2019 13.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement, or the remaining portion thereof, shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any such term or other provision, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated to the fullest extent possible. 13.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, including by means of email in portable document format (.pdf), each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

      "Model: Section 2.1 grants the Distributor non-exclusive rights to distribute the products in the Territory. Section 2.2 allows the Supplier to remove inactive territories after the initial term. Section 2.3, however, allows the Supplier to sell directly to end users within the USA at any time, which is the entirety of the territory defined in Schedule 2. This effectively nullifies the distributor's non-exclusive rights within the USA, creating a contradiction.\n",

Section 20.2(d) states that if delivered by email, a notice is deemed to have been duly received on the date and at the time such email is received by the recipient whether such message is opened at that time.

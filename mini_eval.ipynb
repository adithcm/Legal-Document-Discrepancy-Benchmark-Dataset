Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the merchandise along with email address of the other party. 2. The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction. 3. Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means. 4. i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer. 5. The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment. 6. The buyer receives and accepts the merchandise. 7. i-Escrow sends the check to the seller.

    "The file is a legal document and you are to check for any discrepancies or contradictions within the file.\n",
    "There are 10 categories when it comes to discrepancies or contradictions:\n",
    "1. Ambiguity in text - Ambiguities in text occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",
    "2. Ambiguity in legal terms - Ambiguities in legal terms occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "3. Inconsistencies in text - Inconsistencies in text also lead to **in-text contradictions** when **different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties**. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.\n",
    "4. Inconsistencies in legal terms - Inconsistencies in legal terms arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "5. Misaligned in text - Misaligned terminology leads to **in-text contradictions** when the contract **uses multiple terms interchangeably without defining them**, leading to conflicting obligations.\n",
    "6. Misaligned in legal terms - Inconsistencies arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "7. Omission in text - Omissions also cause **in-text contradictions** when a **key contractual clause is removed**, but **other sections still reference it**, creating an internal contradiction.\n",
    "8. Omission in legal terms - Omissions occur when a contract **removes essential information**, creating legal loopholes. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract omits **a legally mandated consumer protection**, making it non-compliant.\n",
    "9. Structural Flaws in text - this means that the text is not structured properly and does not make sense.\n",

It states that the per Transaction Inquiry amount is calculated at i-Escrow's sole discretion and can be revised to reflect market conditions, also at i-Escrow's discretion. The final sentence explicitly says i-Escrow can adjust the rate as it sees fit without needing consent. This effectively means that 2TheMart has no control or negotiation power over the fees they receive, which contradicts the implied good faith and fair dealing expected in contractual relationships. While contracts can favor one party, this level of unilateral control over payment terms creates an imbalance that could be deemed unconscionable or indicative of a lack of mutual agreement on essential terms.\n",

      "Model: This section is contradictory because it states that advertising fees are based on Transaction Inquiries, but then it gives i-Escrow sole discretion to determine the per Transaction Inquiry amount and to revise the formula at any time without 2TheMart's consent. This effectively gives i-Escrow complete control over the advertising fees, potentially rendering the 'based on Transaction Inquiries' aspect meaningless. It creates a situation where 2TheMart has no ability to predict or negotiate these fees, making the payment terms uncertain and potentially unfair.\n",

By stating ADAMS GOLF only 'intends' to pay the compensation and making it subject to financial performance and a subjective evaluation of brand value, the contract introduces significant uncertainty. This undermines the consultant's assurance of receiving the agreed-upon compensation, potentially leading to disputes over payment obligations. This lack of a guaranteed base compensation could be seen as a structural flaw in the payment terms.\n",

JVLS, LLC dba Vaccines 2Go contributed $60,000.00 USD from contracts and 10% of any gross revenue. This is also valued at $3,500,000.00. There is no evidence to suggest that JVLS, LLC would have the same amount in capital contribution as the leased office space from BorrowMoney.com, inc. In addition, 10% is ambiguous as it is not clearly stated what contract JVLS, LLC should be receiving the 10% of, so the calculation on whether it would be equal to the $3,500,000.00 cannot be determined, creating an in-text contradiction.\",\n",

The second portion of the text reads that Domini will not be fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor; but shall only be responsible in cases of gross negligence.

Specifically, the penalty for termination (one year of average management fees) applies equally to both the Trust and the Sponsor.

If the Sponsor terminates due to circumstances beyond its control (e.g., regulatory changes, internal restructuring making the agreement unsustainable), it seems unfair to penalize them with a year's worth of fees.

The wording 'Sponsor may perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust' initially suggests the Sponsor has a discretionary role under the direction of the Board.

This creates a contradiction because the initial list of responsibilities implies oversight and management, yet the 'notwithstanding' clause denies any responsibility for asset management (rendering investment advice and supervision) and distribution. This lack of clarity about the Sponsor's actual role in oversight and management creates an ambiguity.\",\n",

Therefore, the Trust is indirectly paying for these personnel through the Sponsor's fees, even though the section states Domini is responsible for their salaries.

If the Trust terminates the agreement mid-period, the Sponsor would expect to be compensated, but that may not be the case, because there is a termination clause that says this can be done without penalty.

      "    \"explanation\": \"The statement that Domini is not responsible for acts or omissions of a subcontractor that are outside the scope of the contracted services creates a potential contradiction. While Domini may define the 'scope of contracted services' with the subcontractor, the Trust is contracting with Domini for *all* oversight, administrative, and management services as reasonably requested by the Trust (Section 1). This means Domini is ultimately responsible for ensuring *all* services requested by the Trust are properly executed. This clause attempts to limit Domini's liability beyond its contracted scope with the subcontractor even if it falls under the services Domini promised the Trust. This introduces a contradiction and ambiguity about the extent of Domini's responsibility to the Trust for all aspects of the agreed-upon services.\",\n",

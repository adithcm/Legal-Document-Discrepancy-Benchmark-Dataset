    "INSTRUCTIONS = \"\"\"You are a legal contract expert and know how to check legal documents properly and find any discrepancies or contradictions within a file. You are also aware of all state and national laws when it comes to legal docuements.\n",
    "The file is a legal document and you are to check for any discrepancies or contradictions within the file.\n",
    "There are 10 categories when it comes to discrepancies or contradictions:\n",
    "1. Ambiguity in text - Ambiguities in text occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",
    "2. Ambiguity in legal terms - Ambiguities in legal terms occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "3. Inconsistencies in text - Inconsistencies in text also lead to **in-text contradictions** when **different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties**. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.\n",
    "4. Inconsistencies in legal terms - Inconsistencies in legal terms arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "5. Misaligned in text - Misaligned terminology leads to **in-text contradictions** when the contract **uses multiple terms interchangeably without defining them**, leading to conflicting obligations.\n",
    "6. Misaligned in legal terms - Inconsistencies arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "7. Omission in text - Omissions also cause **in-text contradictions** when a **key contractual clause is removed**, but **other sections still reference it**, creating an internal contradiction.\n",
    "8. Omission in legal terms - Omissions occur when a contract **removes essential information**, creating legal loopholes. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract omits **a legally mandated consumer protection**, making it non-compliant.\n",
    "9. Structural Flaws in text - this means that the text is not structured properly and does not make sense.\n",
    "10. Structural Flaws in legal terms - this means that the legal terms used in the text are not structured properly and do not make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Read the file and look for the text enclosed between the tags \"<*$p$*>\" within the file.\n",
    "2. Provide a detailed explanation of why this is a discrepancy or contradiction.\n",
    "3. Provide the section where the discrepancy or contradiction exists.\n",
    "4. Provide the section location. Example: Section 5.4.                                    \n",

The omitted portions have been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT This Strategic Collaboration Agreement (\"Agreement\"), effective as of the 23rd day of September, 2016 (\"Effective Date\"), is entered into by and between The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, with a place of business located at 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA (\"MD Anderson\"), a member institution of The University of Texas System (\"System\") and Adaptimmune LLC, with a place of business located at 2001 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 1903, USA (\"Adaptimmune\"); and Adaptimmune Limited, with a place of business at 101 Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, OX14 4RY (\"Adaptimmune Limited\") (MD Anderson and Adaptimmune each a \"Party\" and collectively the \"Parties\"). WITNESSETH Whereas Adaptimmune and Adaptimmune Limited are biotechnology companies involved in the field of research, development and marketing of pharmaceutical products and therapies, including the sponsorship of clinical trials. Whereas MD Anderson is a comprehensive cancer research, treatment, and prevention center, with scientists and technicians in substantive fields relating to cancer research. Whereas the Parties hereby wish to establish a strategic alliance, as further described herein, (\"Alliance\") whereby Adaptimmune will provide funding and in-kind support for: (a) one or more preclinical studies (\"Pre-clinical Studies\"); and (b) one or more clinical and related correlative studies (\"Clinical Studies\") to be conducted by MD Anderson pursuant to this Agreement (each such Clinical Study or Pre-clinical Study, a \"Study,\" and all such Clinical Studies and Pre-clinical Studies, the \"Studies.\"). Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and conditions hereinafter recited, the Parties do hereby agree as follows: 1. Subject and Scope of Agreement 1.1 The initial scope of the Alliance will consist of the Studies described in Exhibit I, the details of which are to be mutually agreed upon by the JSC from time to time in accordance with Sections 1.5 - 1.8 below). The Studies and/or the scope of the Alliance may be replaced and/or changed as agreed upon by the JSC. Adaptimmune shall have responsibility for IND filing and monitoring unless otherwise agreed by JSC. The Alliance Funding (defined in Section 1.3 below) will cover enrollment of a minimum of *** Clinical Study subjects into Clinical Studies (with Clinical Studies in this context excluding any screening Study or long term follow-up Study) (\"Minimum Patient Numbers\"). MD Anderson represents and undertakes that (a) *** and (b) that the *** (together (a) and (b) being the ***): 1.2 Adaptimmune shall be the sponsor of any Clinical Study. MDACC shall be responsible for the conduct of each Study in accordance with the relevant protocol and/or workscope. The Agreement shall govern the performance of Studies by MD Anderson and one or more Principal Investigator(s) on basis of *** Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission. 1 Study specific documents (\"Study Orders\") as agreed upon by the Parties. This Agreement shall apply to all Studies set out in the Study Orders performed by MD Anderson and the MD Anderson principal investigator(s) responsible for the performance of such Studies (\"Principal Investigator(s)\") upon execution of Study Orders during the term of this Agreement. Each Study Order shall be substantially in the form attached as Exhibit III to this Agreement and shall detail the specifics of the Study to be performed under such Study Order including, without limitation, (i) the detailed Protocol or workscope, (ii) the Principal Investigator and (iii) identify any project-specific resources or support provided by Adaptimmune. In the event of any conflict of terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Study Order, the terms of this Agreement shall govern, unless the Study Order specifically and expressly supersedes this Agreement with respect to a specific term, and then only with respect to the particular Study Order and specific term. If there is any discrepancy or conflict between the terms contained in a Protocol or workscope and this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order, the terms of the Protocol or workscope shall govern and control with respect to clinical/scientific matters and the terms of the Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order in that order shall govern and control with respect to all other matters, e.g., legal and financial matters. 1.3 Adaptimmune agrees to commit funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the term (\"Alliance Funding\"). The JSC may allocate and/or re-allocate funds to Studies as necessary and agreed by JSC. The basic per patient estimate for Clinical Studies is as follows: for screening Clinical Studies: $***, for long term follow-up Clinical Studies: $*** and for other Clinical Studies: $***. If the Parties extend the term by mutual agreement as set forth herein, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith the amount of future Study funding commitments by Adaptimmune applicable to such extended term. In the event a Study is terminated early, then in relation to any funds allocated to such Study, the Parties shall promptly discuss and agree upon a replacement of that Study with a new study of similar scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties and that is approved by the JSC, and that will be funded by the Alliance Funding. If there is any Alliance Funding at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, it will be allocated to studies, research or tests agreed by the JSC, and such Alliance Funding will be payable in accordance with agreed milestones relevant to such agreed studies, research or tests. The Parties understand that the compensation being paid to MD Anderson under this Agreement constitutes the fair market value of the services to be provided hereunder. Neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator shall seek or accept reimbursement from any third-party payor for any Study items or procedures supplied by or paid for by Adaptimmune under this Agreement. MD Anderson acknowledges that Adaptimmune may be obligated to disclose all payments made hereunder, including the provision of non-monetary items of value, as may be required under Applicable Law, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, passed as Section 6002 of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, agrees to keep and maintain relevant records of such and, upon Adaptimmune's reasonable request, provide such records to Adaptimmune to the extent such information is not already in Adaptimmune's possession, but only to the extent required for Adaptimmune to comply with its legally required reporting obligations. MD Anderson consents to such disclosure, to the extent such disclosure is required for Adaptimmune to comply with Applicable Laws. MD Anderson shall ensure that the Principal Investigator provides in a timely manner all such reasonable information to Adaptimmune necessary for Adaptimmune to comply with any disclosure requirements to the extent required by and in accordance with 21 C.F.R. Part 54, including but not limited to, any information required to be disclosed in connection with any financial relationship between Adaptimmune and the Principal Investigators and sub-investigators involved in the Study, as well as any immediate family members thereof. MD Anderson will ensure that Principal Investigator promptly updates any provided information if any relevant changes occur during the performance of any Study and for one year following completion of any Study. *** Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission. 2 No amounts paid under this Agreement are intended to be for, nor shall they be construed as, an offer or payment made in exchange for any explicit or implicit agreement to purchase, prescribe, recommend, or provide a favorable formulary status, for any Adaptimmune product or service. Any such compensation will be consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions and will not be determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the Parties for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs. MD Anderson and Adaptimmune each confirm that in entering into this Agreement they have not accepted any bribes or illegal inducements to enter into this Agreement or to perform any Study and will not accept any bribe or illegal inducement or offer any bribe or illegal inducement in the performance of or for the performance of any Study whether during or after the termination or expiry of this Agreement. 1.4 The nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the Studies shall be due and payable to MD Anderson according to the schedule outlined in Table 2 in Exhibit II. The JSC retains the right to prioritize and replace Studies as necessary subject to Section 1.6. 1.5 The Parties will establish a Joint Steering Committee (\"JSC\") of equal representation, comprised of three (3) representatives (employees, directors or consultants who are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations) from each Party, with the representatives of each Party collectively having one vote on all matters to be decided upon by the JSC. Each Party can appoint and replace its representatives in the JSC at its own discretion through timely written notice to the other Party. 1.6 The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least one meeting per year will be conducted in person or by videoconference (including the kick-off meeting). The JSC will decide on matters by unanimous vote with each of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune exercising one vote each provided, however, that no action may lawfully be taken at any meeting unless at least two representatives of each Party (including for this purpose any proxy representative appointed as provided below) are present at the meeting. If a member of the JSC is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may appoint, in writing, a proxy to participate and vote in his or her stead. Decisions may also be made by electronic mail, provided such electronic mail is provided by at least two representatives from Adaptimmune and MD Anderson and such electronic mail is acknowledged to be received by the recipient. Although decision will be made by mutual agreement of the JSC, in the event of any disagreement, *** . 1.7 The main task of the JSC will be to oversee the Alliance. In order to achieve the objectives of the Alliance, the JSC will oversee each Study under the Alliance. The JSC will provide technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidance to the Studies and will be responsible for monitoring progress of these Studies. Additional representatives can be invited by the JSC on a case by case basis should discussion of certain topics require so, provided that such guests will be subject to an obligation of confidentiality and non-use at least as strict as Section 5 below. In the event a Study is terminated early or does not initiate, the Parties shall promptly replace that Study with a new study similar in scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties. Once agreed by the JSC, such replacement study will be funded by the Alliance Funding and payable in accordance with agreed milestones for such replacement study. *** Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission. 3 1.8 In addition, the JSC will be responsible for coordinating resolution of problems arising in the Studies or in the Alliance as a whole. In the event of any matter to which the JSC cannot reach resolution, or in the event of any dispute arising as to any matter subject to JSC responsibility and save where Adaptimmune has the deciding vote in accordance with Section 1.6 above, such matter or dispute will be escalated to executive management of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune for good faith resolution. Both Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve any matter or dispute on a timely basis. 1.9 MD Anderson represents and certifies that neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator will, directly or indirectly, offer or pay, or authorize an offer or payment of, any money or anything of value to any Public Official (defined below) or public entity, with the knowledge or intent that the payment, promise or gift, in whole or in part, will be made in order to improperly influence an official act or decision that will assist Adaptimmune in securing an improper advantage or in obtaining or retaining business or in directing business to any person or entity in relation to the Study. In addition to other rights or remedies under this Agreement or at law, Adaptimmune may terminate the affected Study Order if MD Anderson breaches any of the representations or certifications contained in this Section or if Adaptimmune learns that improper payments are being or have been made to any Public Official by MD Anderson or Investigator. For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Public Official\" means any officer or employee of a government, a public international organization or any department or agency thereof, or any person acting in an official capacity, including, for a public agency or enterprise; and any political party or party official, or any candidate for public office. Adaptimmune acknowledges and agrees that MD Anderson is an agency of the State of Texas, and its investigator, employees, and officers do constitute a Public Official, as used in this paragraph, for purposes of this Section. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.9, nothing in this Section shall constitute a limitation on MD Anderson's ability to operate within its legal capacity as an agency of the State of Texas, nor shall anything in this Agreement require MD Anderson to violate any law or to refrain from complying with any law applicable to MD Anderson. 2. Responsibilities and Compliance 2.1 Each Clinical Study shall be subject to review and approval of the Study protocol (\"Protocol\") as required by MD Anderson's Institutional Review Board (\"Institutional Review Board\" or \"IRB\") and/or any relevant authorities prior to commencement of the Study as may be required in order to comply with Applicable Laws. 2.2 The scope of the Study to be performed shall be set forth in the Protocol(s) or workscope referenced in the Study Order, which shall be incorporated by reference into such Study Order.

Principal Investigator Date: Name 44 EXHIBIT IV 45 DRAFT RELEASE MD Anderson Cancer Center and Adaptimmune Form Strategic Alliance to Advance Development of Immunotherapies Targeting Multiple Cancers PHILADELPHIA, and HOUSTON, U.S.A. and OXFORD, UK, September XX, 2016 ‚Äî Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: ADAP), a leader in T-cell therapy to treat cancer, and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center announced today that they have entered into a multi-year strategic alliance designed to expedite the development of novel adoptive T-cell therapies for multiple types of cancer. The alliance pairs MD Anderson's preclinical and clinical teams with Adaptimmune's scientists and proprietary SPEAR¬Æ (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell technology platform, which enables Adaptimmune to identify targets expressed on solid and hematologic cancers and to develop affinity enhanced T-cell receptors (TCRs) with optimal potency and specificity against them. The teams will collaborate in a number of areas including preclinical and clinical development of Adaptimmune's SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting MAGE-A10 and future clinical stage first and second generation SPEAR T-cell therapies such as MAGE-A4 across a number of cancers, including bladder, lung, ovarian, head and neck, melanoma, esophageal and gastric cancers. The alliance will also drive research and development of other new SPEAR TCR therapies to targets in other tumor types such as breast cancers and facilitate clinical study participation by MD Anderson in other Adaptimmune trials. Access to MD Anderson's tumor repository will guide further target selection and clinical trial design, while its cancer immunology cores and expertise in performing translational medicine studies may help optimize the efficacy and safety of SPEAR T-cell therapies. \"At MD Anderson, we are focused on providing the best possible care for cancer patients, including implementing important new technologies and treatment modalities,\" said Elizabeth Mittendorf, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of Breast Surgical Oncology. David Hong, M.D., associate professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at MD Anderson added, \"It is our hope this alliance will allow us to address numerous solid tumors and augment the patient's immune system, directing it against tumors based on their specific molecular makeup.\" \"We believe that this strategic alliance will provide a strong partnership for the development of multiple new first and subsequent generation SPEAR T-cell therapies against many intractable solid tumors in our near-term clinical programs,\" commented Rafael Amado, Adaptimmune's chief medical officer. \"It will also generate invaluable data from patient samples that will help us understand these therapies and design the next generation of studies. We are very proud to form this alliance with the outstanding team of cancer immunologists at MD Anderson, and are confident that together we can move these novel immunotherapeutic candidates forward for patients who are fighting a variety of cancers.\" About MD Anderson The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston ranks as one of the world's most respected centers focused on cancer patient care, research, education and prevention. The institution's sole mission is to end cancer for patients and their families around the world. MD Anderson is one of only 45 comprehensive cancer centers designated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). MD Anderson is ranked No.1 for cancer care in U.S. News & World Report's \"Best Hospitals\" survey.

About Adaptimmune Adaptimmune is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapy products based on its SPEAR¬Æ (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform. Established in 2008, the company aims to utilize the body's own machinery - the T-cell - to target and destroy cancer cells by using engineered, increased affinity TCRs as a means of strengthening natural patient T-cell responses. Adaptimmune's lead program is a SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the NY-ESO cancer antigen. Its NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has demonstrated signs of efficacy and tolerability in Phase 1/2 trials in solid tumors and in hematologic cancer types, including synovial sarcoma and multiple myeloma. Adaptimmune has a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for the development and commercialization of the NY-ESO TCR program. In addition, Adaptimmune has a number of proprietary programs. These include SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting the MAGE-A10 and AFP cancer antigens, which both have open INDs, and a further SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the MAGE-A4 cancer antigen that is in pre-clinical phase with IND acceptance targeted for 2017. The company has identified over 30 intracellular target peptides preferentially expressed in cancer cells and is currently progressing 12 through unpartnered research programs. Adaptimmune has over 250 employees and is located in Oxfordshire, U.K. and Philadelphia, USA.

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\\\"Warranty Period\\\"). \\\"Installation\\\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray.

The language is unclear regarding when the 'Installation' of the System occurs if Accuray does not perform the installation itself.

It doesn't clearly define what constitutes installation, or when it is considered complete.

Typically, the sponsor (Adaptimmune in this case) is responsible for both IND (Investigational New Drug) filing AND overall monitoring of the clinical trial. IND filing and monitoring responsibilities are typically intertwined; the sponsor is ultimately accountable for the safety and data integrity of the trial. Separating these responsibilities raises concerns about oversight and potential regulatory issues. MD Anderson handling 'all monitoring responsibilities' is overly broad and ambiguous.

As set forth herein, 2TheMart will promote Services to its auction users (buyers and sellers), and i-Escrow shall develop Co-Branded Site, and develop the Information Transfer Mechanism working with 2TheMart to make Services available seamlessly to Customers. Unless otherwise specified, each party shall be responsible for all development, hosting and other costs associated with the pages resident on their servers and all emails to users they send. 2.2 INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the initial operation of the Information Transfer Mechanism and to describe such operation and development fees, in a statement of work (\"SOW\"). Each party shall make available sufficient and qualified engineers to negotiate the SOW. No SOW shall be binding on the parties unless mutually approved by both parties. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. Once approved, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently implement their respective obligations under the SOW. Upon completion of its duties under the SOW, a party shall notify the other party and provide the other party with the opportunity to test and evaluate its work. i-Escrow shall make available the Shadow Site for such testing in a timely manner. Each party shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in effectuating their respective duties under the SOW. The Information Transfer Mechanism shall not go live until its operation has been approved (\"Approval Date\") by both parties, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. 2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate. 2.4 RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS. i-Escrow may place banner advertising on the Co-Branded Site upon prior written approval of 2TheMart, which shall be at the discretion of 2TheMart. All advertising revenue arising from the banner ads shall be solely i-Escrow\\'s. i-Escrow shall not run banner advertisements on the Co-Branded Site for any of 2TheMart\\'s competitors. 2TheMart shall provide in writing, a list of companies they would like to exclude, including every time they wish to change this list. 2.5 SERVICE PERFORMANCE OF INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM. The parties each shall in good faith work to provide reasonable service levels with respect to the operation of the portions of the Information Transfer Mechanism in their control. Source: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999 2.6 PROGRAM REVIEW MEETINGS. The parties shall meet, at least once per month either in person, or by telephone, to coordinate the implementation of this agreement over time. 3. PROMOTION. After Launch Date, 2TheMart will widely promote the Services: (a) To every seller and high bidder through means including, but not limited to, end of auction emails containing links, such that, it shall be possible for the buyer or seller to initiate a Transaction Inquiry with i-Escrow, without having to re-enter all their personal or transaction related information. (b) By adding links to Co-Branded Site in FAQ section of 2TheMart auctions. (c) By adding links to Co-Branded Site on the seller listing pages of 2TheMart auctions. (d) By displaying a text or graphic link to a page containing information about Services on all auction item pages and bidding pages to educate bidders about i-Escrow. 2TheMart may use the \"Escrow Services Description\" attached in Exhibit A for creating such a page. 5.

    "INSTRUCTIONS = \"\"\"You are a legal contract expert and know how to check legal documents properly and find any discrepancies or contradictions within a file. You are also aware of all state and national laws when it comes to legal docuements.\n",
    "The file is a legal document and you are to check for any discrepancies or contradictions within the file.\n",
    "There are 10 categories when it comes to discrepancies or contradictions:\n",
    "1. Ambiguity in text - Ambiguities in text occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",
    "2. Ambiguity in legal terms - Ambiguities in legal terms occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "3. Inconsistencies in text - Inconsistencies in text also lead to **in-text contradictions** when **different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties**. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.\n",
    "4. Inconsistencies in legal terms - Inconsistencies in legal terms arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "5. Misaligned in text - Misaligned terminology leads to **in-text contradictions** when the contract **uses multiple terms interchangeably without defining them**, leading to conflicting obligations.\n",
    "6. Misaligned in legal terms - Inconsistencies arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "7. Omission in text - Omissions also cause **in-text contradictions** when a **key contractual clause is removed**, but **other sections still reference it**, creating an internal contradiction.\n",
    "8. Omission in legal terms - Omissions occur when a contract **removes essential information**, creating legal loopholes. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract omits **a legally mandated consumer protection**, making it non-compliant.\n",
    "9. Structural Flaws in text - this means that the text is not structured properly and does not make sense.\n",
    "10. Structural Flaws in legal terms - this means that the legal terms used in the text are not structured properly and do not make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Read the file and check for any discrepancies or contradictions within the file.\n",
    "2. Provide a detailed explanation of why this is a discrepancy or contradiction.\n",
    "3. Provide the section where the discrepancy or contradiction exists.\n",
    "4. Provide the section location. Like Section 5.4.                                    \n",
    "5. Categorize the discrepancy or contradiction into one of the 10 categories above (return the number of the category).\n",
    "There are 2-3 contradictions in each text.\n",

    "    \"explanation\": \"This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. Section 3(a) states that all installments are due by November 1st, but the added sentence allows the final payment to be made as late as December 15th without penalty. This creates ambiguity as to the actual deadline for the final installment and whether late fees would apply between November 2nd and December 15th.\"\n",

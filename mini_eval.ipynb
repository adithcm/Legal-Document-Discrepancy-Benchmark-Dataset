Magliarditi By:/s/Sanjay Bajaj Name: Dominic J. Magliarditi Name: Sanjay Bajaj Title: President Title: VP Business Development Date: 6/21/99 Date: 6/11/99 EXHIBIT A ESCROW SERVICES DESCRIPTION Successful completion of a transaction involves exchange of merchandise with payment. The buyer has to be satisfied he/she received what they thought they were getting and the seller has to be sure he/she gets paid. i-Escrow holds payment from the buyer in trust until the seller sends the merchandise to the buyer. Once the buyer accepts the merchandise, i-Escrow forwards the payment to the seller by writing a check. A typical escrow transaction: When an auction ends, your end of auction email contains links to i-Escrow. Once you have signed up with i-Escrow you go through the following steps to complete your transaction. 1. Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the merchandise along with email address of the other party. 2. The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction. 3. Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means. 4. i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer. 5. The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment. 6. The buyer receives and accepts the merchandise. 7. i-Escrow sends the check to the seller.

    "The file is a legal document and you are to check for any discrepancies or contradictions within the file.\n",
    "There are 10 categories when it comes to discrepancies or contradictions:\n",
    "1. Ambiguity in text - Ambiguities in text occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",
    "2. Ambiguity in legal terms - Ambiguities in legal terms occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "3. Inconsistencies in text - Inconsistencies in text also lead to **in-text contradictions** when **different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties**. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.\n",
    "4. Inconsistencies in legal terms - Inconsistencies in legal terms arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "5. Misaligned in text - Misaligned terminology leads to **in-text contradictions** when the contract **uses multiple terms interchangeably without defining them**, leading to conflicting obligations.\n",
    "6. Misaligned in legal terms - Inconsistencies arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "7. Omission in text - Omissions also cause **in-text contradictions** when a **key contractual clause is removed**, but **other sections still reference it**, creating an internal contradiction.\n",
    "8. Omission in legal terms - Omissions occur when a contract **removes essential information**, creating legal loopholes. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract omits **a legally mandated consumer protection**, making it non-compliant.\n",
    "9. Structural Flaws in text - this means that the text is not structured properly and does not make sense.\n",

      "Model: This section grants each Joint Venturer broad authority to act on behalf of the Joint Venture, including incurring debt, disposing of assets, and making purchases. However, it later restricts the need for written consent or approval only to 'strategic partnerships with other organizations.' This creates ambiguity because it doesn't specify a threshold for financial decisions, potentially allowing one venturer to commit the Joint Venture to substantial financial obligations without the other's explicit consent. The term 'strategic partnerships' is also vague, leaving room for interpretation and potential disputes over what constitutes such a partnership.\n",

      "Model: The first sentence establishes a contradictory condition, stating that the Joint Venture will be effective until terminated with a 30-day notice, regardless of the original termination date. This nullifies the concept of a fixed term, rendering the initial commencement date somewhat meaningless because either party can dissolve the venture at any time with short notice. The second sentence further complicates the matter by stating the termination clause supersedes any prior agreement regarding the venture's term, indicating there may have been a previously agreed-upon term length that is now irrelevant.\n",

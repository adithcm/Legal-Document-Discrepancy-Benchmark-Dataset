Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the merchandise along with email address of the other party. 2. The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction. 3. Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means. 4. i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer. 5.

    "The file is a legal document and you are to check for any discrepancies or contradictions within the file.\n",
    "There are 10 categories when it comes to discrepancies or contradictions:\n",
    "1. Ambiguity in text - Ambiguities in text occur when key terms are **inconsistently defined within the document itself**, creating internal contradictions. This type of **in-text contradiction** confuses contract enforcement by allowing multiple interpretations of the same term in different sections, leading to potential legal disputes over meaning.\n",
    "2. Ambiguity in legal terms - Ambiguities in legal terms occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "3. Inconsistencies in text - Inconsistencies in text also lead to **in-text contradictions** when **different sections of a contract provide conflicting deadlines, obligations, or penalties**. This creates ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.\n",
    "4. Inconsistencies in legal terms - Inconsistencies in legal terms arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "5. Misaligned in text - Misaligned terminology leads to **in-text contradictions** when the contract **uses multiple terms interchangeably without defining them**, leading to conflicting obligations.\n",
    "6. Misaligned in legal terms - Inconsistencies arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "7. Omission in text - Omissions also cause **in-text contradictions** when a **key contractual clause is removed**, but **other sections still reference it**, creating an internal contradiction.\n",
    "8. Omission in legal terms - Omissions occur when a contract **removes essential information**, creating legal loopholes. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract omits **a legally mandated consumer protection**, making it non-compliant.\n",
    "9. Structural Flaws in text - this means that the text is not structured properly and does not make sense.\n",

It's unclear if this means Allied is responsible for paying these taxes directly to the relevant authority, or if Newegg will deduct the amount of these taxes from the Sponsorship Fee payment.\\\",\\n    \\\"category\\\": 1\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"section\\\": \\\"5.1 Allied grants Newegg a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-transferable, and non- sublicensable worldwide license to use, publicly display, transmit, broadcast, stream, distribute and reproduce the Allied Marks in all approved forms and in manners for the purposes of this Agreement during the Term. Allied acknowledges and agrees that Newegg shall not pay any fees or royalties for the license of the Allied Marks, except the Sponsorship Fee specified in Schedule 3.\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"While it states the license is royalty-free, the phrase 'except the Sponsorship Fee specified in Schedule 3' introduces ambiguity. It suggests that the Sponsorship Fee, which Newegg pays, could be interpreted as a royalty, contradicting the 'royalty-free' nature of the license. This could lead to disputes about the true nature of the Sponsorship Fee.\\\",\\n    \\\"category\\\": 1\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"section\\\": \\\"6.1 Newegg grants Allied a revocable, non-transferrable, non-assignable (whether voluntarily, or as a result of a change of control, or by operation of law), non-sublicensable, non-exclusive and limited license to use, during the Term, the Newegg Marks solely in connection with Allied\\u2019s marketing and conduct of the Arena.\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"The phrase 'whether voluntarily, or as a result of a change of control, or by operation of law' following the term 'non-assignable' seems misaligned. While the intent is to emphasize the non-assignability, the added phrase is more typically associated with the term 'non-transferable'.

The terms 'where possible and appropriate' and 'where reasonably practicable' are subjective and create uncertainty about the level of effort Allied is actually required to put forth in communicating Newegg's exclusive sponsorship.

It outlines an agreement to negotiate, but does not guarantee a reduction or refund. The 'where applicable' lacks clarity. It's unclear what criteria determine when a refund is applicable, leaving room for disagreement and potentially undermining Newegg's right to compensation for a reduced benefit.\\\",\\n    \\\"category\\\": 1\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"section\\\": \\\"14.2 Each Party may also terminate the Agreement for convenience after Contract Year 2 (as defined in Section 14.4) by providing written notice to the other Party at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the effective date of such termination\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"This section allows for termination for convenience after Contract Year 2, which seems reasonable. However, Section 14.4 outlines specific financial obligations for Newegg if they default or breach the agreement during Contract Years 1 and 2. There is no reciprocal clause for Allied. If Allied terminates for convenience after Contract Year 2, it is unclear if Newegg receives any compensation for the potential loss of benefits or investments made in reliance on the full term of the agreement. This omission creates a potential imbalance in the termination rights and could be viewed as unfair to Newegg.\\\",\\n    \\\"category\\\": 7\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"section\\\": \\\"15.10 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. ...

This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"This section contains conflicting provisions regarding dispute resolution. It mandates arbitration for 'any dispute, claim or controversy' arising from the agreement. However, it also states that the section 'shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.' Injunctive relief is a legal remedy sought from a court, not an arbitrator. This creates ambiguity as to whether all disputes must first go to arbitration before a party can seek injunctive relief, or if injunctive relief is an exception to the arbitration requirement. This contradiction needs to be clarified to avoid confusion and potential legal challenges regarding the appropriate forum for resolving disputes.\\\",\\n    \\\"category\\\": 3\\n  }\\n]\\n```\"\n",

Newegg has 60 days from the invoice date to remit payment.\",\\n    \"explanation\": \"The statement that \\'Any value-added, goods and services, or similar tax or duty imposed by any government or tax authority on any Sponsorship Benefit shall be borne solely by Allied\\' is ambiguous. It\\'s unclear if this means Allied is responsible for paying these taxes directly to the relevant authority, or if Newegg will deduct the amount of these taxes from the Sponsorship Fee payment.\",\\n    \"category\": 1\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"section\": \"5.1 Allied grants Newegg a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-transferable, and non- sublicensable worldwide license to use, publicly display, transmit, broadcast, stream, distribute and reproduce the Allied Marks in all approved forms and in manners for the purposes of this Agreement during the Term. Allied acknowledges and agrees that Newegg shall not pay any fees or royalties for the license of the Allied Marks, except the Sponsorship Fee specified in Schedule 3.\",\\n    \"explanation\": \"While it states the license is royalty-free, the phrase \\'except the Sponsorship Fee specified in Schedule 3\\' introduces ambiguity. It suggests that the Sponsorship Fee, which Newegg pays, could be interpreted as a royalty, contradicting the \\'royalty-free\\' nature of the license. This could lead to disputes about the true nature of the Sponsorship Fee.\",\\n    \"category\": 1\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"section\": \"6.1 Newegg grants Allied a revocable, non-transferrable, non-assignable (whether voluntarily, or as a result of a change of control, or by operation of law), non-sublicensable, non-exclusive and limited license to use, during the Term, the Newegg Marks solely in connection with Allied’s marketing and conduct of the Arena.\",\\n    \"explanation\": \"The phrase \\'whether voluntarily, or as a result of a change of control, or by operation of law\\' following the term \\'non-assignable\\' seems misaligned. While the intent is to emphasize the non-assignability, the added phrase is more typically associated with the term \\'non-transferable\\'.

The terms \\'where possible and appropriate\\' and \\'where reasonably practicable\\' are subjective and create uncertainty about the level of effort Allied is actually required to put forth in communicating Newegg\\'s exclusive sponsorship.

However, Section 14.4 outlines specific financial obligations for Newegg if they default or breach the agreement during Contract Years 1 and 2. There is no reciprocal clause for Allied. If Allied terminates for convenience after Contract Year 2, it is unclear if Newegg receives any compensation for the potential loss of benefits or investments made in reliance on the full term of the agreement.

This creates ambiguity as to whether all disputes must first go to arbitration before a party can seek injunctive relief, or if injunctive relief is an exception to the arbitration requirement.

                "original_text": "1.2 \"CRO\" means a contract research organization selected by ArTara to assist in the Project as approved by the University and/or Principal Investigator, such approval not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 \"CRO\" means a contract research organization selected by ArTara to assist in the Project without any need for approval from the University or Principal Investigator.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the CRO selection process. The original text states that the CRO needs approval from the University and/or Principal Investigator, while the modified text removes this requirement, creating uncertainty about who has the authority to approve the CRO.",

The University and/or Principal Investigator together with ArTara and the CRO will conduct the Project in accordance with the Project Plan and will use all reasonable endeavors consistent with their expertise to successfully complete the Project. It is the goal of the Project to use the Program Data as clinical support for Product Regulatory Filings and to gain approval to commercialize the Product for the Indication in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Performance of Project. Only ArTara and the CRO will conduct the Project without the need for the University's or Principal Investigator's involvement. It is the aim of the Project to use the Program Data as clinical support for Product Regulatory Filings and to achieve marketing clearance to commercialize the Product for the Indication in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original agreement by removing the University's and Principal Investigator's involvement from the Project, whereas originally they were involved in performing the Project. It also uses 'aim' instead of 'goal' and replaces 'approval' with 'marketing clearance', adding to the inconsistency of the terminology in the agreement.",

Access to all original Program Data shall be provided to ArTara and the CRO at University's facilities in accordance with the Project Plan for the purposes of review and copying as and only to the extent needed to support ArTara's efforts to accomplish the Project. As between ArTara and the University, ownership of all Program Data is hereby retained by the University.",

ArTara and the CRO are allowed all access to original Program Data at ArTara's facilities without any required adherence to the Project Plan and only for the purpose of enabling ArTara's undertakings associated with the Project. Ownership of all Program Data is hereby transferred to ArTara and the University.",
                "explanation": "The change contradicts the terms by stating that access to Program Data will be at ArTara's facilities and with no requirements to the Project Plan and that the ownership of Program Data will be now shared between ArTara and the University. It introduces a direct contradiction on the owner of Program Data.",

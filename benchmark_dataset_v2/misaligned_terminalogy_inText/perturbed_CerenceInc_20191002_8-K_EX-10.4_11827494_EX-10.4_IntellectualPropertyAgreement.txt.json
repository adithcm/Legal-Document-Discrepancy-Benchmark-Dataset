                "explanation": "The original definition excludes information publicly known *without* breach. The modified version removes that key condition, such that any publicly available information is excluded, regardless of the means by which it became public. This creates a contradiction in what constitutes Confidential Technical Information. The altered definition broadens the scope of what is not considered confidential, potentially harming the disclosing party if information is leaked and becomes public.",

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party's assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party's assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party's Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party.",

But the modified version says that 'Any purported assignment without such approval shall be subject to review by the non-assigning party'. This is an in-text contradiction because approval and consent is used interchangeably. But based on this update, it is unclear about the ramifications of assigning the agreement without said approval.",

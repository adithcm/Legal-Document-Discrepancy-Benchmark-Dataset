Subject to the protocol in Section 5.1, ALFA AESAR may return to NTC any Product that is defective or that fails to comply with the purchase order provided by ALFA AESAR. NTC shall return to ALFA AESAR as promptly as possible, a working replacement or, in the event such replacement is not possible or at ALFA AESAR's election, it shall credit ALFA AESAR's account for the invoiced price and shipping charges of the defective Product. The correction of such defective Product shall be at no cost to ALFA AESAR. The cost of shipping the replacement Product back to ALFA AESAR shall be paid by NTC. THE CORRECTION OF SUCH DEFECT BY REPAIR OR CREDITING ALFA AESAR'S ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF THE PRODUCT IN THE MANNER SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF DISTRIBUTOR WITH RESPECT TO ANY WARRANTY GIVEN HEREIN RELATING TO ANY PRODUCT SOLD OR DELIVERED HEREUNDER.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'shall be paid by NTC' to 'subject to negotiation' creates a contradiction, as the original states a clear obligation for NTC to pay, while the modified text introduces uncertainty and allows for potential disputes regarding shipping costs. Also, using 'ALFA AESAR' instead of 'DISTRIBUTOR' adds another layer of confusion of who is involved in the legal responsibility.",

Definitions:   1.1 \"Product\" or \"Products\" mean those nanomaterials, coated nanomaterials and dispersions of nanomaterials listed in Schedule A, as amended from time to time by mutual written agreement signed by the parties.     1.2 \"Product Price\" means the price for Products listed in Schedule A sold by NTC to ALFA AESAR.",

Definitions:   1.1 \"Goods\" or \"Products\" mean those nanomaterials, coated nanomaterials and dispersions of nanomaterials not necessarily listed in Schedule A, as amended from time to time unilaterally by NTC.     1.2 \"Product Price\" means the price for Products not listed in Schedule A sold by NTC to ALFA AESAR.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Product' as listed in Schedule A and requiring mutual agreement for amendment, whereas the revised text redefines 'Product' to include items 'not necessarily' listed in Schedule A and allows NTC to change the schedule unilaterally. This creates a contradiction regarding what constitutes a 'Product' under the agreement and who has the authority to change the product list.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'shall protect' to 'may, at its discretion, protect' introduces a contradiction regarding NTC's obligation to indemnify ALFA AESAR. The original text enforces a binding agreement, while the modified text makes it optional. The removal of 'reasonable attorneys' fees', change of 'gross negligence or willful misconduct' to 'possible negligence or unintentional misconduct', 'the Products' to 'some goods' and 'excepting' to 'without exceptions' further weakens NTC's responsibilities.",

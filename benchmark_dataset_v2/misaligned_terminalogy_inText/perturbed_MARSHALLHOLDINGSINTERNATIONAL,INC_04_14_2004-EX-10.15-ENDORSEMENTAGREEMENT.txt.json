                "explanation": "The term 'engagement' is replaced with 'agreement,' and 'endorsement' is replaced with 'promotion.' While seemingly similar, 'engagement' in the original context implied an active obligation, whereas 'agreement' is more passive. 'Endorsement' suggests a formal approval, while 'promotion' could be interpreted as simply mentioning the product. This creates ambiguity about the CELEBRITY's required level of support.",

Accordingly, CELEBRITY will be responsible for payment of all federal, state, and local taxes on compensation paid under this Agreement, including income and social security taxes, unemployment insurance, and any other taxes due relative to Distributor's Personnel and any and all business license fees as may be required. This Agreement neither expressly nor impliedly creates a                                                 ---\n      relationship of principal and agent, or employee and employer, between Distributor's Personnel and the COMPANY.

Therefore, Bruce Jenner is responsible for remitting some federal, state, and municipal taxes on payment made per this Contract, potentially including income and social security taxes, worker's compensation, and any other fees related to Subcontractor's Employees and any and all business permits, if relevant. This Contract neither expressly nor impliedly forms a                                                 ---\n      relationship of principal and representative, or worker and business owner, between Subcontractor's Employees and The Right Solution. Neither Bruce Jenner nor Bruce Jenner Employees are authorized to enter into any contracts on behalf of the",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'independent contractor' with 'service provider,' 'Agreement' with 'Contract,' 'taxes' were softened to 'some taxes,' 'Distributor's Personnel' to 'Subcontractor's Employees,' 'business license fees' to 'business permits, if relevant', 'relationship of principal and agent, or employee and employer' with 'relationship of principal and representative, or worker and business owner'. These changes soften and weaken the definition of the CELEBRITY's role, potentially blurring the lines between an independent contractor and a representative of the COMPANY. This has tax implications as well as implications regarding authority to bind the company to other contracts.",

The CELEBRITY will have full release of liability in regards to product performance and/or law suites resulting from use of the product. This liability will remain the responsibility of the COMPANY and manufacturers.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the clauses herein, The Right Solution and Bruce Jenner consent to protect, maintain and safeguard each other from any demands, allegations, acts, damages, debts, costs and outlays, encompassing, but not limited to, interest, fines and lawyers' costs and expenditures brought against or placed on either side because of any act or a violation of any statement, guarantee, pledge, term, or deal of the other signatory to this Contract. The CELEBRITY will have limited release of accountability in concerns to product operation and/or lawsuits emerging from utilization of the product. This accountability will potentially remain the responsibility of The Right Solution and factories.",
                "explanation": "This replaces legal terms like 'indemnify, defend and hold harmless' with more general terms like 'protect, maintain and safeguard'. 'Claims' is replaced with 'allegations', 'Agreement' with 'Contract', 'full release' becomes 'limited release', 'liability will remain' becomes 'liability will potentially remain', 'manufacturers' to 'factories'. This diminishes the strength and clarity of the indemnification clause. By changing 'full release' to 'limited release', the extent of CELEBRITY's protection becomes vague. Adding \"potentially\" to “liability will remain” also reduces the clarity of who is responsible for product performance. Changing manufacturers to factories adds an ambiguity as well.",

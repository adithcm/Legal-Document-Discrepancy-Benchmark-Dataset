No Party shall attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment  Letter until the conditions set forth in this Section have been satisfied. Purchaser shall have no right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter  unless and until directed to do so by the unanimous written consent of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor).",

No Party shall attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment  Letter until the conditions set forth in this Section have been satisfied. Purchaser shall have no right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter  unless and until directed to do so by the unanimous written consent of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor).",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Sponsor' has been replaced with 'Investor' in the first sentence and 'Funder' in the second. These terms are used interchangeably without a clear definition, potentially creating confusion regarding who is bound by the warranties. It's uncertain whether 'Investor' and 'Funder' have the same obligations or whether the obligations can be enforced in the same way. This could cause disputes during enforcement, as these terms are not defined.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Sponsor' has been replaced with 'Funder' at the start of the sentence. Also, 'Defaulting Sponsor' has been replaced with 'Non-Compliant Funder'. These changes create confusion regarding which entities the 'Participating Sponsor' can terminate. It becomes unclear whether a Funder and Sponsor are subject to the same requirements. This introduces uncertainty in termination rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Sponsor' has been replaced with 'Investor' at the start of the sentence. This change creates ambiguity as to who is responsible for indemnification. If 'Sponsor' and 'Investor' are not the same entity, the obligation to indemnify becomes unclear. The phrase \"representations, warranties or covenants of such Sponsor contained herein\" could be interpreted as limiting indemnification to only breaches by the entity still explicitly called a Sponsor, excluding 'Investor', creating an enforcement conflict. This can lead to significant disputes regarding which party is responsible for covering losses.",

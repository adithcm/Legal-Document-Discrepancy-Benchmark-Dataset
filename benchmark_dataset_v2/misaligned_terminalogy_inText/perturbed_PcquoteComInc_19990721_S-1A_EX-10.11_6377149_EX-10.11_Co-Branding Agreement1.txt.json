(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\"), a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business at 300 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60605 and AB Wately, Inc.

(hereinafter referred to as \"PCQ\"), a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business at 300 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60605 and AB Wately, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as \"AB Watley\" or \"the Client\") with its principal place of business at 33 West 17th Street, New York, NY  10011. This agreement shall apply to said ABW and all of its subsidiaries and related companies.",
                "explanation": "The term \"ABW\" is also referred to as \"AB Watley\" or \"the Client.\" This creates ambiguity about the roles and responsibilities, particularly later when the agreement refers to ABW, potentially impacting the interpretation of obligations and liabilities.",

                "explanation": "Here, the entities are referred to in multiple ways: ABW, AB Watley and Client, all potentially referring to the same entity. The changes introduce confusion, especially when discussing ABW's responsibilities, as it is not clear whether 'Client' and 'AB Watley' refer to the same legal entity in all contexts.",

                "explanation": "The use of 'the Client' in one instance and 'AB Watley's' in another introduces an inconsistency. It becomes unclear which legal entity is ultimately responsible for adherence to the agency regulations regarding the data redistribution, especially if 'the Client' is later defined differently within the agreement or its interpretation.",

                "explanation": "The contract initially defines the agreement as the \"Agreement\", the company as the \"Company\", and the consultant as the \"Consultant\". Changing these to \"Contract\", \"Organization\", and \"Advisor\" respectively introduces inconsistency. Later references to \"Agreement\", \"Company\", and \"Consultant\" will be ambiguous.",

The Consultant agrees to perform such consulting, advisory and related services to and for the Company as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Company, including, but not limited to, the services specified on Schedule A to this Agreement. The Consultant also agrees to provide the Company with related services that may be requested from time to time by the Company. During the Consultation Period (as defined below) and for a period of one year thereafter, except in connection with his performance of the Services, the Consultant shall not engage in any activity in the field described on Schedule A to this Agreement, and he shall not assist any other person or organization that engages in any such activity.",
                "changed_text": "Responsibilities. The Advisor agrees to perform such consulting, advisory and related duties to and for the Organization as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Organization, including, but not limited to, the duties specified on Schedule A to this Contract. The Advisor also agrees to provide the Institution with related duties that may be requested from time to time by the Organization. During the Engagement Period (as defined below) and for a period of one year thereafter, except in connection with his execution of the Responsibilities, the Advisor shall not engage in any activity in the field described on Schedule A to this Contract, and he shall not assist any other person or organization that engages in any such activity.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Services' to 'Responsibilities', 'Company' to 'Organization', 'Consultant' to 'Advisor', 'Consultation Period' to 'Engagement Period' and 'Agreement' to 'Contract' and then introducing 'Institution' creates uncertainty. While the parties are expected to understand their obligations based on the initially defined terms, using these terms will create confusion and potential disputes.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall reimburse the Consultant for all reasonable and necessary documented out of pocket expenses incurred or paid by the Consultant in connection with, or related to, the performance of Consultant's services under this Agreement.\n\nThe Consultant shall submit to the Company itemized monthly statements, in a form satisfactory to the Company, of such expenses incurred in the previous month. The Company shall pay to the Consultant amounts shown on each such statement within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof.",

The Organization shall pay to the Advisor amounts shown on each such statement within forty-five (45) days after receipt thereof.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Company' with 'Organization' and 'Institution', 'Consultant' with 'Advisor', and 'Agreement' with 'Contract' creates confusion. Introducing 'Independent Contractor' and 'Contractor' further compounds this. Also, changing 'expenses' to 'costs', 'services' to 'duties', and changing the payment timeframe from 'thirty (30) days' to 'forty-five (45) days' after receipt introduces conflicting obligations that could cause disputes over payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that UTK is 'agreeable' to provide services, implying a voluntary commitment. The modified text states that UTK is 'obligated' to provide the services, suggesting a mandatory requirement. This introduces a conflict as to the nature of UTK's commitment and level of effort required and thus adds uncertainty to enforcement.",

UTK cannot guarantee results on behalf of AVDU, but shall pursue all reasonable avenues available through its network of contacts. The acceptance and consumption of any transaction is subject to acceptance of the terms and conditions by its sole discretion.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that UTK will devote time and efforts as it deems 'commercially reasonable' and 'cannot guarantee results.' The modified text states that UTK will devote 'minimal time and effort' as it deems fit, and 'shall deliver guaranteed results'. This creates a contradiction: how can UTK guarantee results with minimal effort?",

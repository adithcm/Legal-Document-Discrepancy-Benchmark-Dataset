                "explanation": "This change creates an internal contradiction regarding the ownership and confidentiality of the 'Reports.' Originally, the reports and their contents are designated as Confidential Information and owned by the 'Licensee.' The modified text states that the reports and their content are the Confidential Information and the property of the 'Licensor'. This introduces ambiguity concerning who controls and has rights to the data within the reports, as well as who is responsible for maintaining its confidentiality.",

                "original_text": "Licensor shall be solely responsible for the Titles and any and all legal liability resulting from the Titles, excluding any legal liability caused by Licensee's breach of this Agreement or gross negligence with regards to the Titles. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensor shall be solely responsible for any and all royalties and other fees payable to any applicable licensor(s) or any third party for distribution of the Titles by Licensee (including, without limitation, residuals and clearances or other payments to guilds or unions and rights for music clearances, such as performance rights, synchronization rights and mechanical rights), and all other fees, payments and obligations arising out of the activities contemplated by this Agreement, and Licensee shall have no responsibility or liability for any such royalties or fees.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor shall be primarily responsible for the Titles; however, Licensee assumes secondary responsibility for any and all legal liability resulting from the Titles, especially concerning issues arising from distribution, even in the absence of Licensee's breach of this Agreement or gross negligence. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensor remains responsible for the initial royalties and other fees payable to any applicable licensor(s) or any third party; however, Licensee shall be responsible for any subsequent royalties, residuals and clearances, or other payments to guilds or unions relating to the ongoing distribution of the Titles.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines that Licensor is solely responsible for the Titles, and any royalties or fees. This change introduces a contradiction by shifting a secondary level of responsibility onto the 'Licensee' even without any breach or gross negligence. It also changes Licensee to be responsible for the royalties, residuals, etc. This creates confusion over who bears the ultimate liability, and what conditions trigger Licensee's involvement, potentially undermining the Licensor's warranty.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly defines the agreement's duration as 20 years, but can be terminated early as described in section 7b. The modified text replaces the term 'Term' with 'Period,' making it indefinite and contradicting the original duration specification. The new text also restricts the method of termination, which contradicts section 7b. This creates uncertainty about the intended length of the agreement and the conditions for its termination, potentially leading to disputes over its validity and enforceability.",

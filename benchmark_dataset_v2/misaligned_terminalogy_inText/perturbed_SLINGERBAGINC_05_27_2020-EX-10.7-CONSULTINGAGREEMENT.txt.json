                "explanation": "The term 'consultant' is changed to 'advisor.' Although seemingly similar, the contract doesn't define these. The legal obligations associated with a 'consultant' can differ from those of an 'advisor,' leading to ambiguity in the scope of services.",

                "explanation": "In the modified text, 'Base consulting fee' is replaced with 'base compensation', even though Base Consulting Fee is used after. This introduces ambiguity as to whether 'compensation' is equivalent to the Consulting Fee or includes other forms of payment. This could be used to argue that only the consulting fee and not other compensations need to be paid.",

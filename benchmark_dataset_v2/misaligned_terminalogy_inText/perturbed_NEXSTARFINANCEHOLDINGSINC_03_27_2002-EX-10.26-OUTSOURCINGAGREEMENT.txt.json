                "explanation": "The terms 'personnel' and 'workforce' are used interchangeably although the contract never defines them as being equivalent. This creates uncertainty because 'workforce' may be interpreted more broadly than 'personnel', potentially leading to disputes over who has control over certain individuals or groups working at WYZZ-TV.",

                "explanation": "The term 'good order' is replaced with 'acceptable condition' and 'cost' is replaced with 'expense'. The term acceptable condition is very vague. It is unclear if acceptable condition means the equipment can be in disrepair as long as the expense is covered.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'capital expenditures' is replaced with 'capital outlays'. While they may seem synonymous, 'capital expenditures' has a very specific accounting definition and tax implications, which might differ from a common lay definition of 'capital outlays'. It's not clear if they refer to the same thing. This could lead to disagreement about what constitutes shared expenditures.",

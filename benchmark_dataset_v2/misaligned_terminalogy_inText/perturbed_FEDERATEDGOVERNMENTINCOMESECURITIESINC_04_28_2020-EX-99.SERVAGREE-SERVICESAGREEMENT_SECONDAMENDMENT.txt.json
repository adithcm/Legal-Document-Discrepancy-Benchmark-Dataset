The rest of the agreement refers to \"Accounts.\" It's now unclear whether \"Client Accounts\" is a subset of \"Accounts\" or a completely separate category, leading to confusion regarding which services apply to which entities. If there are any distinctions between 'Accounts' and 'Client Accounts' it can affect obligations under the agreement.",

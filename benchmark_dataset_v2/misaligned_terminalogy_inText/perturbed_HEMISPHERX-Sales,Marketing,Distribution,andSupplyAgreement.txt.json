                "original_text": "\"HEMISPHERX Intellectual Property\" means all HEMISPHERX patents, patent applications, know-how, and trademarks owned or controlled by HEMISPHERX up to the termination or expiration of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "\"HEMISPHERX Intellectual Property\" means all HEMISPHERX patents, patent applications, trade secrets, and trademarks owned or controlled by HEMISPHERX up to the date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'know-how' to 'trade secrets' and altering the time frame from 'termination or expiration' to 'date of this Agreement,' the definition of HEMISPHERX Intellectual Property becomes contradictory. 'Know-how' and 'trade secrets' are different types of IP. The change in time frame limits what is considered HEMISPHERX IP, creating uncertainty regarding ownership after the agreement date.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'exclusive license' and 'non-exclusive license' contradict each other, creating confusion on the extent of the rights granted to SCIEN. Additionally, changing 'Product' to 'Compound' introduces ambiguity as 'Compound' is not defined, and it's not clear if it refers to the same thing as 'Product.'",

ASSIGNMENT\n\nNeither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations or licenses hereunder may be assigned, pledged, transferred or encumbered by either party without the express prior written approval of the other party, except that either HEMISPHERX or SCIEN may assign this Agreement to any successor by merger or sale of substantially all of its business or assets to which this Agreement pertains, without any such consent. Any assignment in violation hereof is void.",

ASSIGNMENT\n\nThis Agreement and any rights or obligations or licenses hereunder can be assigned, pledged, transferred or encumbered by either party with the express written notification of the other party, and HEMISPHERX or SCIEN cannot assign this Agreement to any successor by merger or sale of substantially all of its business or assets to which this Agreement pertains, needing consent. Any assignment without notification is valid.",
                "explanation": "The change that states agreement \"can be assigned\" against original sentence stating it \"may not be assigned\" creates an internal contradiction. Additionally, change from not needing consent to \"needing consent\" again, creating a contradiction.",

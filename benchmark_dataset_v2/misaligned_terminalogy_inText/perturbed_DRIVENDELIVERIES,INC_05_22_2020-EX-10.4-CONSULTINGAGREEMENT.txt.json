The Company may terminate this Agreement immediately and without prior notice if Consultant refuses to or is unable to perform the Services or is in breach of any material provision of this contract.",
                "explanation": "Using 'notice' and 'notification' interchangeably in the context of termination introduces ambiguity. While seemingly similar, a 'notice' might imply a more formal or legally binding communication compared to a 'notification.' Similarly, the use of the words 'agreement' and 'contract' interchangeably adds further ambiguity. This could lead to disputes regarding the validity of termination depending on how each term is interpreted.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'liabilities' to 'responsibilities' shifts the legal weight, as responsibilities are less forceful than liabilities. The subtle alteration from 'attorneys' fees' to 'lawyers' fees' could cause confusion. Replacing 'agents' with 'representatives' in the first clause dilutes the legal accountability. Referring to the overall agreement as a 'contract' in one clause and 'understanding' in another fundamentally changes the scope of legal recourse. Finally, replacing 'regulations' with 'ordinances' limits the potential issues covered.",

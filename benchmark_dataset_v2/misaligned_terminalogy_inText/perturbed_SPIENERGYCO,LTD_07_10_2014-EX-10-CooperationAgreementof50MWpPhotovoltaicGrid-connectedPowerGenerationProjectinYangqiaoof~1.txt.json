Party B will give full play to the advantages in funds, talents, technologies, and etc. to accelerate the preliminary work progress of the project, ensure the early commencement of the project and produce benefits upon early completion.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Party A' is changed to 'The Local Authority', and 'Party B' to 'The Investor'. The original text guarantees preferential policies, while the changed text removes this commitment, only expressing support. Also, the change dilutes Party B's/The Investor's obligations, stating they 'will utilize resources' instead of 'give full play to advantages' and 'ensure early commencement', creating conflicting levels of commitment.",

                "changed_text": "The Investor ensures that land use complies with regulations for large-scale energy projects. Comprehensive development should be conducted to maximize agricultural output, and preference shall be given to local laborers and materials, pending budgetary approval.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Party B' is now 'The Investor.' The commitment to interplant commercial crops is weakened to a suggestion to 'maximize agricultural output.' The guaranteed 'priority' for local employees and materials is made conditional on 'budgetary approval,' which contradicts the previous absolute promise and makes the obligations of the Investor less certain. This creates an internal contradiction and uncertainty about enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Reseller Agreement' to 'Distribution Agreement' in the opening paragraph, while keeping the entity as 'Reseller' creates a contradiction.

                "explanation": "Changing 'Reseller' to 'Distributor', 'best endeavors to vigorously promote and resell' to 'its discretion to promote and distribute' introduces a conflict. 'Best endeavors' implies a high level of effort, while 'its discretion' allows for minimal effort, and changing 'resell' to 'distribute' changes the essence of the duties of the parties.",

The original enforces quotas as a condition for the Reseller, whereas the modified version replaces quota with affecting 'commission structure' and changes contract termination into 'renegotiation'",

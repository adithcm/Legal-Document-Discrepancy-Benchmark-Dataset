If such Power Performance Warranty calculation indicates that the Actual kWh of the Bloom Systems was less than the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period, then Operator shall so notify Owner in writing of the basis of its determination and Owner may make a claim under Section 2.5.

The \"Power Performance Warranty\" is now called \"Power Assurance\". These changes introduce different terminologies for what is essentially the same calculation and notification process, potentially leading to disputes about whether the obligations under \"Power Performance Warranty\" still apply or if they are now governed by the terms of \"Power Assurance.\"",

                "explanation": "The terms “Qualified Fuel Cell Provider” and “Qualified Fuel Cell Project” were modified to be “Certified Fuel Cell Provider” and “Renewable Fuel Cell Project” respectively. It’s unclear whether these terms are interchangeable, especially since the original terms are explicitly defined in the contract's recitals with specific references to REPS Act Section 352(16) and Section 352(17). Using different terms might imply different standards or requirements, causing confusion about whether the provider and project still meet the necessary qualifications for the Tariffs.",

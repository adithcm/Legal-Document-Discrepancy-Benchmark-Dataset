                "changed_text": "(b) From and after the date on which a Receivable or Participation Interest, as applicable, is sold to the Owner, the Servicer shall service and administer each related Serviced Asset for the benefit of the Owner and shall extend, amend or otherwise modify such Serviced Asset, by complying in all material respects with the following (collectively, the \"Service Requirement\"): (A) minimal oversight, using a lesser degree of skill and attention than the Servicer exercises with respect to comparable receivables that it services for itself or others, and (B) internal company policy.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Servicing Standard\" is changed to \"Service Requirement\" and its definition is altered to contradict the original standard of 'reasonable care' and 'Applicable Law' with 'minimal oversight' and 'internal company policy'. This creates uncertainty regarding the level of care expected from the Servicer.",

The Servicer will be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee for the performance of the duties and provision of the services called for in this Agreement in accordance with, and subject to, the Loan Agreement. The Servicing Fee shall be payable on each Payment Date for the immediately prior Servicing Period in accordance with Section 2.4 of the Loan Agreement. Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Owner.",

The Servicer will be entitled to receive the Service Payment for the performance of the duties and provision of the services called for in this Agreement at the discretion of the Owner. The Service Payment will be determined by the Owner, with no fixed amount nor date for payments. Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Servicer.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Servicing Fee' is replaced with 'Service Payment', and the payment terms are changed. The original text ties the fee to the Loan Agreement and specific payment dates, while the revised text makes the payment discretionary, with no fixed amount or payment date, which goes against the Loan Agreement. Additionally, costs are now at the expense of the servicer.",

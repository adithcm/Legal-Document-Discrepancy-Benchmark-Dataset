It becomes unclear what laws and requirements the distribution of the prospectus needs to align with, creating conflict and making the clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Agent' to 'Representative', 'Company' to 'Business', and removing references to people who control the Company, while also eliminating counsel's fees, introduces contradictions. The original text uses “Company Indemnitees”, but this new wording is ambiguous. The second sentence now creates confusion. It is uncertain when they will be reimbursed or held harmless, opening up the chance of legal disputes.",

All fees incurred, and profit/loss incurred in connection with hedging of the JSMA Output shall be for the account of the JSMA. All hedging is to be done on a physical, not specula- tive, basis.",

Any costs, gains, or losses connected with hedging the JSMA Output will be the responsibility of Bunker One. Hedging may be conducted on either a physical or speculative basis.",

The changed text states that Bunker One will manage risk management activities according to their discretion and hedging may be conducted on either a physical or speculative basis. This change introduces a contradiction regarding who has the authority for risk management decisions and whether hedging can be speculative, which can create uncertainty in enforcement.",

The changed text states that Vertex may, at its discretion, compensate Bunker One for direct damages, expenses, and liabilities, excluding legal fees, resulting from Vertex’s ordinary negligence, a violation of any general terms, or non-performance of any warranty made by Vertex. This change introduces a contradiction by making indemnification discretionary and limited to direct damages and excluding legal fees, creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

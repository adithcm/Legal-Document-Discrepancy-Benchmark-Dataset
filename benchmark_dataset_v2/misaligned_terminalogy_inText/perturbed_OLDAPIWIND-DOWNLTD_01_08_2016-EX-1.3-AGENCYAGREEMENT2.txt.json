While it could be argued that these refer to the same things, failing to consistently use the original terms introduces ambiguity. It's now unclear if Shares and Securities are the same, if the Corporation is the same as the Company, and whether there's a distinct 'Agency Agreement' separate from the 'Dealer Agreement'.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Securities' is replaced with 'Shares' and 'Investments', 'U.S. Affiliate' with 'U.S. Subsidiary' and 'Corporation' with 'Company.' This creates more ambiguity, particularly between 'Shares' and 'Investments' and 'U.S. Affiliate' and 'U.S. Subsidiary'. Are 'Investments' a broader category than 'Shares'? Is a 'U.S. Subsidiary' held to the same standards as a 'U.S. Affiliate'? The lack of consistent terminology raises these questions and creates uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change refers to the 'Agency Agreement' as the 'Dealer Agreement'. This creates confusion about which agreement's definitions should be used. Adding the clause 'However, some terms might have alternate interpretations as per internal policy' creates an explicit contradiction, suggesting that the definitions in the agreement might not be the final word and creating an avenue for dispute. It introduces an undefined and potentially conflicting standard.",

                "original_text": "1.12 \"SOFTWARE\" means computer programs and systems, whether embodied in software , firmware or otherwise, including, software  compilations, software, software implementations of algorithms, software tool sets, compilers, and software models and methodologies  (regardless of the stage of development or completion) including any and all: (a) media on which any of the foregoing is recorded; (b)  forms in which any of the foregoing is embodied (whether in Source Code, Object Code, executable code or human readable form); (c)  translation, ported versions and modifications or any of the foregoing. Source Code means fully documented human-readable source  code form of the Software, including programmer's notes and materials and documentation, sufficient to allow a reasonably skilled  programmer to understand the design, logic, structure, functionality, operation and features and to use, operate, maintain, modify,  support and diagnose errors. Object Code means Software in machine-readable form that is substantially or entirely in binary form or  otherwise directly executable by a computer after processing or linking.",
                "changed_text": "1.12 \"SOFTWARE\" means computer programs and systems, whether embodied in software, firmware or otherwise. It includes all software compilations, implementations of algorithms, models and methodologies, regardless of completion stage. (a) It includes media on which data is recorded; (b) It also covers forms in Source Code, Object Code, or executable code; (c) Translation, ported versions, and modifications are included.  However, for clarity, in this agreement, 'Software' specifically excludes Object Code; only Source Code is considered as Software.",
                "explanation": "The original definition broadly includes both Source Code and Object Code as part of 'Software'. The modified definition, however, explicitly excludes Object Code later in the definition. This creates a contradiction regarding what constitutes 'Software' under the agreement. This can cause disagreements on what the license is for.",

The Licensee acknowledges and understands neither, the Licensor, nor any of its respective affiliates, employees,  officers or agents shall assume any responsibility or liability for the system's operations, involving the operations  of any equipment, (including but not limited to computer equipment or peripherals, server equipment,  communication equipment and data lines, all such equipment, collectively referred to herein as the \"Equipment\").",

The Licensee acknowledges and understands neither, the Licensor, nor any of its respective affiliates, employees,  officers or agents shall assume any responsibility or liability for the system's operations, involving the operations  of any peripherals, server equipment and data lines. All the equipment, is collectively referred to herein as the \"System\".",
                "explanation": "The original definition includes \"computer equipment\" as part of 'Equipment,' while the modified version excludes it. The revised version now directly states that the group of components is 'System', a divergence from the original intention. This creates an internal contradiction, because the original definition of the equipment include also the computer equipment.",

In the event of such immediate termination Licensor shall retain all of it rights under this Agreement and applicable law EXCEPT FOR the right to receive payments for all trades performed using the Licensed Technology.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows Licensor to retain the right to receive payments for trades even after termination due to Licensee's breach. The modified version explicitly removes this right, creating a direct contradiction on what rights the Licensor retains post-termination. If the Licensor cannot receive payment it could cause legal issues.",

Later in the document, the term 'Parties' is used in clauses regarding obligations, creating ambiguity as to whether 'Entities' is bound by those clauses.

Such Engagement Letter shall include customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. The services to be performed by the Bank shall be set forth in such Engagement Letter and are expected to include, among others: (a) assisting in the drafting and preparation of one or more prospectus supplements describing GWG, the Shares and the terms of the Offerings; (b) advising the Seller Trusts on a marketing and distribution strategy for each Tranche of Shares, including whether a particular Tranche should be sold through a block trade, overnight bookbuild, or similar transaction; (c) assisting GWG in preparing marketing materials and conducting one or more \"roadshows\" and meetings with potential purchasers of the Shares; (d) advising the Seller Trusts as to the timing, structure and pricing of the Offerings; (e) providing other advisory services as are customary for similar transactions.",

Throughout the rest of the document, the term 'Bank' and 'Offerings' remain, leading to confusion about which entity and activity is being referenced in specific clauses (e.g., Section 1.5, 1.6 and 2). Is GWG only entitled to appoint an additional book-running manager if the entity is defined as \"Bank\" or does it encompass any Financial Institution?",

The contract refers to the 'Bank' in earlier sections with specific responsibilities and liabilities. Now it also refers to the 'Financial Partner' and the agreement's 'Duration'. Because these terms are used in different contexts, it's uncertain which term dictates the entity's obligations and how long the entity is obligated to provide services. The definition of the original term is still in use.",

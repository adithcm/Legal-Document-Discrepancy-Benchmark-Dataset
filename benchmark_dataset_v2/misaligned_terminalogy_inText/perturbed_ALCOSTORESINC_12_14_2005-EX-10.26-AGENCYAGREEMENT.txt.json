It is specifically agreed that all of the power and authority vested to the Company herein shall be subject to any modifications as may from time to time be made by Lessor.",
                "changed_text": "Lessor hereby appoints the Company, and the Company hereby agrees to accept such appointment, as the representative of Lessor, without any fee for acting as such agent, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for the purpose of ordering and, subject to the conditions set forth in Section's 2.01 and 2.05 hereof, accepting Equipment on Lessor's behalf for leasing to the Company under the Lease from the respective supplier thereof (each a \"Supplier\" and collectively, the \"Suppliers\"). It is specifically agreed that all of the power and authority vested to the Company herein shall be subject to any modifications as may from time to time be made by Lessor.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agent' to 'representative' introduces ambiguity. While seemingly synonymous, legal definitions can differ. The contract heavily relies on the 'agent' designation, especially regarding liability and obligations. Using 'representative' without defining its specific powers creates uncertainty about the Company's authority and duties.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Purchase Order' to 'Order Form' creates confusion about the formal document required for equipment acquisition. While 'Purchase Order' is defined, 'Order Form' is not. This could lead to disputes about whether a specific document qualifies for triggering the Company's ordering authority, especially considering the detailed conditions in later sections.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Purchase Orders' to 'Equipment Requests' makes it unclear which documents bind the Lessor. 'Purchase Orders' has a defined meaning in Section 2.01. Because, 'Equipment Requests' are undefined; this inconsistency makes it difficult to enforce the conditions outlined in this section, as it is uncertain whether the condition applies to the 'Equipment Request' or the 'Purchase Order.'",

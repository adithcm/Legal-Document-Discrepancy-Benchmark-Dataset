                "explanation": "Changing \"Content\" to \"Data\" in Section 1.1 while Appendix 2 still defines the term as \"Content\" creates confusion and contradiction. It becomes unclear if plan_b can use all types of data, or just the content as specified in the appendix. This could lead to disputes about what exactly is licensed.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"Content\" with \"Material\" creates ambiguity as the contract defines \"Content,\" but not \"Material.\" This could be problematic because it is not clear what falls under \"Material,\" possibly leading to disputes about what plan_b has rights to distribute. \"Material\" is broader than \"Content\" and may not be the true intention of what the contract should cover.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"distribute\" to \"disseminate\" creates a subtle, but potentially significant difference. \"Distribute\" implies a more formal and controlled process, whereas \"disseminate\" suggests a broader and potentially less controlled spread of the content. This shift may lead to disagreement about whether plan_b is adhering to the original intent of the agreement concerning content control and reach to the End Users.",

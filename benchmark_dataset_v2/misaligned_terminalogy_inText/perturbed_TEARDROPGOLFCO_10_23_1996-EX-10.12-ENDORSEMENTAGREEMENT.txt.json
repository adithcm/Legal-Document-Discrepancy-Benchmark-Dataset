DEFINITIONS: As used herein, the terms set forth below shall be defined as follows:\n\n         (a)  \"Ogle Endorsement\" shall mean the name, likeness, photograph, and               endorsement of Ogle.\n\n         (b)  \"Endorsed Product\" shall mean a putter manufactured, distributed,               promoted, advertised and sold by TPC bearing the \"Teardrop               Putter\" name and/or logo.",

DEFINITIONS: As used herein, the terms set forth below shall be defined as follows:\n\n         (a)  \"Ogle Endorsement\" shall mean the name, likeness, photograph, and               endorsement of Ogle.\n\n         (b)  \"Endorsed Product\" shall mean a putter supplied, marketed,               promoted, advertised and sold by Teardrop Putter Corporation bearing the \"Teardrop               Putter\" name and/or logo.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'manufactured, distributed' to 'supplied, marketed' creates ambiguity. While seemingly similar, 'manufactured' and 'distributed' imply specific roles and responsibilities in the product lifecycle. 'Supplied' and 'marketed' are broader and could be interpreted differently, leading to confusion about TPC's obligations, particularly regarding product liability and warranty.",

Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above, TPC agrees that Consolidated Artists shall retain all rights in and to the Ogle Endorsement and shall not be prevented from using or permitting or licensing others to use his name or endorsement in connection with the promotion, advertisement, or sale of any product or service other than a golf putter in the Contract Territory during the Contract Period. TPC further agrees that upon the termination of this Endorsement Agreement for any cause whatsoever, it will cease using the Ogle Endorsement, the name \"Brett Ogle,\" or any facsimile thereof, for any promotional or advertising purposes; provided, however, that TPC shall have the right to use the Ogle Endorsement in advertisements for ad space purchased by TPC prior to the termination of this Agreement for a period of up to six (6) months following such termination. In this connection, TPC shall provide Consolidated Artists with a list of such previously purchased ad space within seven (7) days of the effective date of termination and all such advertisements released after the effective date of termination shall be subject to Consolidated Artists' prior approval pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 7 below.",

TPC further agrees that upon the conclusion of this Endorsement Agreement for any cause whatsoever, it will discontinue using the Ogle Endorsement, the name \"Brett Ogle,\" or any likeness thereof, for any promotional or advertising purposes; provided, however, that TPC shall have the authorization to use the Ogle Endorsement in advertisements for ad space acquired by TPC prior to the conclusion of this Agreement for a period of up to six (6) months following such conclusion. In this connection, TPC shall provide Consolidated Artists with a manifest of such previously acquired ad space within seven (7) days of the effective date of conclusion and all such advertisements released after the effective date of conclusion shall be subject to Consolidated Artists' preliminary approval pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 7 below.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'termination' to 'conclusion', 'facsimile' to 'likeness', 'purchased' to 'acquired', 'list' to 'manifest', and 'prior' to 'preliminary' introduces inconsistency. While some terms seem synonymous, legal interpretation could differ. For example, 'termination' has a clearer legal definition than 'conclusion'. Similarly, 'purchased ad space' implies a financial transaction, while 'acquired ad space' could include bartered or gifted space, creating uncertainty about what rights TPC retains.",

                "original_text": "16. TIME OF THE ESSENCE. TPC acknowledges that time is of the essence in the payment of all compensation due Consolidated Artists hereunder. For the purposes of this Agreement, all payments not received within thirty (30) days of the date due shall be deemed \"past due\". Such past due payments shall bear interest at a rate of two percent (2%) per month OR the maximum rate permissible by law, whichever is less. The imposition of interest provided for in this Paragraph shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Consolidated Artists under this Agreement or otherwise. Accordingly, Consolidated Artists shall not be precluded from exercising any other remedies, whether at law or in equity, to enforce the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "16. TIME OF THE ESSENCE. TPC acknowledges that promptness is important in the remittance of all compensation owed to Consolidated Artists herein. For the purposes of this Agreement, all payments not finalized within thirty (30) days of the date due will be considered \"late\". Such late payments will accrue charges at a rate of two percent (2%) per month OR the highest rate allowed by applicable regulations, whichever is lower. The application of charges provided for in this Paragraph will supplement any other recourse available to Consolidated Artists under this Agreement or otherwise. Consequently, Consolidated Artists will not be prohibited from utilizing any other recourse, whether at law or in equity, to uphold the stipulations of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'time is of the essence' to 'promptness is important', 'payment due' to 'compensation owed', 'past due' to 'late', 'interest' to 'charges', 'remedies' to 'recourse', 'enforce the terms' to 'uphold the stipulations', and 'permissible by law' to 'allowed by applicable regulations' dilutes the legal precision. 'Time is of the essence' is a specific legal term that creates strict deadlines and consequences. Replacing it with 'promptness is important' weakens this requirement. The other changes introduce similar ambiguities, potentially affecting the enforceability of the payment terms.",

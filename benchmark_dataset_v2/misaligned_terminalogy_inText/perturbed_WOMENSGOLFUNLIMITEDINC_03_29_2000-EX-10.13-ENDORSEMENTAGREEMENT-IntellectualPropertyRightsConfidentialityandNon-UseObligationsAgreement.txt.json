The Professional acknowledges her obligations under the provisions of the Intellectual Property Rights Confidentiality and Non-Use Obligations Agreement attached hereto as \"Exhibit A\" and made a part hereof by this reference. The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A shall survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement, regardless of cause or circumstances of the termination or expiration.",

The Professional acknowledges her obligations under the provisions of the Intellectual Property Rights Confidentiality and Non-Use Obligations Agreement attached hereto as \"Exhibit A\" and made a part hereof by this reference. The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A shall survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement arrangement, contingent upon management's approval at the time of separation, regardless of cause or circumstances of the termination or expiration.",
                "explanation": "The term 'endorsement agreement' is replaced with 'endorsement arrangement' and a contingency ('management's approval') is added for the survival of obligations post-termination. This creates a contradiction. Originally, the obligations survived regardless of cause; now, survival depends on approval, creating ambiguity about enforcement. The term 'endorsement arrangement' might be interpreted as a less formal and binding agreement, and as such, is left to the discretion of management.",

                "explanation": "The term \"Intellectual Property\" is replaced by \"Creations\" within the paragraph, but the final sentence still refers to 'Intellectual Property.' This creates a conflict: Are the creations considered Intellectual Property for the purpose of final assignment and execution, or are they distinct? This may affect the enforceability of the assignment, as it is not clearly specified if all Creations are definitively considered Intellectual Property.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Information' is replaced with 'Data,' and the return deadline is changed from \"upon demand, but no later than the completion of work\" to \"30 days following the completion of work\", and is contingent upon the head of marketing's decision. 'Information' and 'Data' are now used seemingly interchangeably, however, the original defined 'Information' quite explicitly, whereas 'Data' remains undefined in this context. The clause that the deadline is not definitive introduces a new possible conflict between the 'Information' definition and the action, and the arbitrary clause addition regarding the head of marketing.",

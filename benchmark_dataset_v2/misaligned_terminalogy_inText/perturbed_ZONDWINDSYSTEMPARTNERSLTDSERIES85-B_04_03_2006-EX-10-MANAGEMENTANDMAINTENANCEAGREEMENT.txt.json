                "explanation": "The terms 'Partners' is replaced by 'Affiliates' and 'Manager' is replaced by 'Operator' but without redefining them. This implies the partners of the partnership are not its affiliates, which could lead to disputes about rights and obligations, and 'Manager' and 'Operator' are now ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Manager' is changed to 'Operator' and 'Partners' to 'Affiliates' which creates a contradiction with the previous section where they were defined, the term shall is changed to may, making it discretionary. This leads to ambiguity about whose Projects can be disconnected. In addition, since these terms were not explicitly defined, the contract has an internal inconsistency.",

                "explanation": "The modified text states that Manager is 'designated entity of Operator'. However, previously, the contract defined 'Manager' as 'ToyoWest Management Inc.'. Now, it suggests 'ToyoWest Management Inc.' is just an entity of 'Operator'. This contradicts the previous definition and complicates determining the liable party.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Execution Date' to 'Effective Date' and 'Parties' to 'Companies' introduces ambiguity. The term 'Execution Date' is used later in the document, and replacing it with 'Effective Date' creates confusion about which date the agreement comes into effect and when specific actions are to be taken. Referring to the involved parties as 'Companies' in one section and 'Parties' elsewhere is inconsistent.",

                "changed_text": "Tsinghua Unigroup shall also introduce other potential vendors, clients and collaborators in Mainland China to ChipMOS.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'suppliers' with 'vendors', 'customers' with 'clients', and 'business partners' with 'collaborators' creates uncertainty about whether these terms are interchangeable or have different meanings. If they aren't defined, it is hard to determine the scope of Tsinghua Unigroup's obligations. It raises questions such as: Does 'vendor' have the same obligations as 'supplier'? Are 'clients' held to the same standard of confidentiality as 'customers'?",

Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide immediate assistance to, and actively cooperate with, the other Party, to implement this Agreement.",

Each Participant shall use its commercially reasonable endeavors to provide prompt assistance to, and actively collaborate with, the other Party, to implement this Understanding.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Parties' to 'Participants,' 'staff' to 'personnel,' 'plan' to 'action plan', 'schedule' to 'timeline', 'specific plan' to 'specific initiative', 'implementation status' to 'execution progress', 'reasonable best efforts' to 'commercially reasonable endeavors,' 'cooperate' to 'collaborate,' and 'Agreement' to 'Understanding' creates multiple ambiguities. It's unclear whether 'Participants' has the same meaning as 'Parties,' whether 'personnel' includes contractors, whether 'action plan' is more or less detailed than a 'plan,' whether 'timeline' must meet the same requirements as a 'schedule', and whether the standard of 'commercially reasonable endeavors' is equivalent to 'reasonable best efforts'. This creates confusion about the scope of the obligations.",

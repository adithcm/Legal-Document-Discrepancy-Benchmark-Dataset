The Online Housing Company retains full control over advertising operations, and any gains, liabilities, duties, taxes and expenses arising therefrom will be owned or paid by Party B.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Party B has sole discretion, while the modified version uses 'Online Housing Company' (referring to Party B) but then states they 'retain full control.' This creates ambiguity as to who ultimately controls advertising operations, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to any 'Party' whereas the modified text refers to each 'Company'. There can be a conflict, since Party A is defined as Beijing Baidu Netcom Science and Technology Co., Ltd., so is Party A a 'Party' or a 'Company?'

(a) The Provider or its affiliate will provide the Company, with respect to the Fiber Ring Assets, all maintenance services (including but not limited to jetwashing and related ancillary services) required under the Provider's license agreements with the municipalities in which the Fiber Ring Assets are located (each a \"City Rights Agreement\"), and monitoring, emergency response and emergency splicing (collectively, the \"Services\"). If a service call is required to restore the Fiber Ring Assets to good operating condition, the Company will notify the Provider promptly after it becomes aware of the service affecting problem.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Provider' to 'Contractor' creates confusion. The contract consistently uses 'Provider' to refer to CityNet Telecommunications, Inc. By introducing 'Contractor' without defining it, it's unclear if the terms are interchangeable or refer to different entities. This can lead to disputes over who is responsible for providing the services.",

This obligation shall include operating the Fiber Ring Assets in such a manner, and performing certain of the obligations of the operator of the Fiber Ring Assets, so as to remain in compliance with such agreements.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'Provider', which is defined as CityNet Telecommunications, Inc. Introducing 'Vendor' without defining it creates ambiguity.

Service provided under this Agreement does not assure uninterrupted operation of equipment.",

Service provided under this Agreement does not assure uninterrupted operation of equipment.",
                "explanation": "Introducing 'Supplier' while retaining 'Provider' creates ambiguity. It is unclear if 'Supplier' is the same entity as 'Provider'. The sentence refers to two actors, one who is not liable and the original provider. The obligation for refund should the service be unavailable is still retained with the 'provider', leaving a liability issue on who exactly is liable.",

Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century.  After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come.\"",
                "changed_text": "\"We are excited about the advantages available to us as a result of our new association with BISYS,\" stated Thomas C. Gregor, chairman and chief executive officer of United National. \"During the past year we completed an evaluation of our data handling requirements going forward into the next century. After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the adaptability and grade of BISYS' TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come.\"",
                "explanation": "The terms 'opportunities' is replaced with 'advantages', 'partnership' with 'association', 'assessment' with 'evaluation', 'information processing needs' with 'data handling requirements', 'flexibility' with 'adaptability' and 'quality' with 'grade'. These changes introduce uncertainty as to whether the 'advantages' and 'association' are the same as the originally stated 'opportunities' and 'partnership'. The rephrasing of the assessment as an evaluation also creates potential ambiguity about the scope of the evaluation of what are the requirements.",

As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National will be  liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services  during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS.",
                "changed_text": "United Financial  Solutions, a third party solutions supplier that United National Bancorp possesses with another joint business associate, currently manages the Bank's data handling operations, record handling and safekeeping operations. As a result of its planned move to BISYS, United National will be relinquishing its share in United Financial Solutions during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS.",
                "explanation": "Several key terms are modified here. 'Services' is replaced with 'Solutions', 'provider' with 'supplier', 'joint venture partner' with 'joint business associate', 'information processing services' with 'data handling operations', 'item processing' with 'record handling', 'deposit services' with 'safekeeping operations', and 'liquidating its interest' with 'relinquishing its share'. It is now unclear if the original entity is the same as the modified one due to the use of such different terminology.",

Nevertheless,  we believe that the enhanced  capabilities  which  BISYS  offers  are  better  matched to the future direction of our Bank.\"",

Nevertheless, we believe that the advanced functionalities which BISYS provides align more effectively with the strategic path of our Bank.\"",
                "explanation": "Here, 'investment' is replaced with 'capital outlay', 'United Financial Services' with 'United Financial Solutions', 'made a great deal of sense' with 'generated considerable value', 'established it' with 'inception', 'significant efficiencies' with 'substantial optimizations', 'sharing of technology' with 'cooperative use of technological advancements', 'processing costs' with 'operational expenditures', 'enhanced capabilities' with 'advanced functionalities' and 'future direction' with 'strategic path'. This again raises questions about whether the 'capital outlay' and 'strategic path' are identical to the original 'investment' and 'future direction'.",

Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Quality Agreement, as between the Parties, MediWound shall be responsible and have liability for all actions and omissions of, and the failure to comply with the applicable terms of this Agreement, applicable Law or Regulatory Standards by the Suppliers in performance of Manufacturing activities for the supply of Products to Vericel for the Territory on behalf of MediWound hereunder.",

Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Quality Agreement, as between the Parties, MediWound is not directly liable for the actions and omissions of the Suppliers in performance of Manufacturing activities for the supply of Products to Vericel for the Territory on behalf of MediWound hereunder; instead, the individual Providers are accountable for their own regulatory compliance.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that MediWound is responsible and liable for the actions of its Suppliers. The modified text introduces 'Providers' as an alternative term for 'Suppliers' and explicitly states MediWound is not directly liable, creating a contradiction regarding liability for Supplier actions.",

The Parties will cooperate to set minimum inventory levels of Key Materials held by Key Materials Suppliers.

The Parties will cooperate to set minimum inventory levels of Key Materials held by Key Materials Suppliers. Vericel may choose to maintain an inventory of [***] supply of unlabeled or labeled Finished Product, or Vericel does not need to in order to supply its commercial requirements, irrespective of the Rolling Forecast, which may be stored at Facility at Vericel's option, cost and risk.",
                "explanation": "The original text says 'Vericel shall maintain an inventory,' which implies a mandatory obligation. The altered version indicates Vericel may choose to maintain an inventory or not maintain, so it's optional for Vericel, which creates an inconsistency regarding inventory maintenance responsibilities.",

MediWound shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause Suppliers to, provide to Vericel in a reasonable, timely manner (including within a reasonable period prior to the due date of Vericel's annual report to an applicable Regulatory Authority with respect to the Product), all information in its or their respective possession which Vericel requires regarding the Product in order to comply with such Regulatory Standards.",

MediWound is not responsible for causing Material Vendors to, provide to Vericel in a reasonable, timely manner all information Vericel requires; it is Vericel's responsibility to obtain that information directly from them.",
                "explanation": "The original text assigns MediWound the responsibility to ensure Suppliers provide necessary regulatory information to Vericel. The edited version replaces 'Suppliers' with 'Material Vendors' and then removes this responsibility from MediWound, stating it is Vericel's obligation to obtain the information directly, creating a direct contradiction.",

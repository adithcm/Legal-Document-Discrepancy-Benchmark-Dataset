                "explanation": "Changing 'AGREEMENT' to 'CONTRACT', 'EFFECTIVE DATE' to 'START DATE' and 'RESELLER' to 'MARKETER' creates confusion as the document inconsistently refers to the same concepts with different terms. The original definition aims to establish clear terminology, but the edited version undermines this by using the terms interchangeably, potentially leading to interpretational ambiguities and disputes over the intended meaning.",

                "explanation": "Changing the first instance of 'Resellers' to 'Distributors' and 'Reseller Plan' to 'Marketer Program' creates ambiguity because later in the same paragraph 'distributor' and 'marketers' are used again. It is unclear if these terms refer to the same role/entity defined earlier as 'RESELLER'. This inconsistent use of terminology creates uncertainty in the obligations and rights of each party.",

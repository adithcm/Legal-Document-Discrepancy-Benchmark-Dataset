                "explanation": "The change from \"shall fund\" to \"must fund a target of\" introduces ambiguity. 'Shall fund' enforces a definitive action, while 'must fund a target of' indicates a goal rather than a binding obligation. Itâ€™s not clear whether there are penalties for not meeting the target, which creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original states risk of loss transfers upon delivery, implying physical receipt. The changed version states risk transfers upon shipment, indicating AEIS only needs to dispatch the Cards.

                "explanation": "Changing \"agrees to an annual review\" to \"may be subject to an annual meeting\" weakens the obligation from a mandatory review to a discretionary meeting. Further, replacing \"This review will include\" with \"This meeting may include\" makes the review topics optional. This introduces uncertainty whether the review is mandatory and what exactly will be reviewed, leading to potential disputes and enforcement issues.",

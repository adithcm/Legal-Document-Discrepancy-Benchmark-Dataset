                "explanation": "In the initial definition, Boxlot is clearly identified as 'Boxlot'. By changing the designation to 'Vendor', it creates confusion throughout the document as to which entity is being referred to in subsequent sections that use either term. This introduces ambiguity, especially when obligations are assigned to 'Boxlot' in some sections and 'Vendor' in others.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Boxlot' is replaced with 'Supplier'. Since 'Vendor' and 'Supplier' are used interchangeably without clear definitions, it is unclear which entity is responsible for the indemnification, thus creating uncertainty in liability assignment.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'promotions' to 'marketing campaigns', the contract introduces ambiguity regarding the scope and nature of the activities to be undertaken. 'Promotions' typically refers to short-term incentives, while 'marketing campaigns' encompass broader strategic efforts. This discrepancy could lead to disputes over the specific actions required of each party under Exhibit A.",

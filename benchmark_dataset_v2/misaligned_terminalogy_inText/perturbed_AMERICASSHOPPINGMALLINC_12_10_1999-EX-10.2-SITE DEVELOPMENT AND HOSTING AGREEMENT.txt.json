As used in this Agreement, \"Deerskin Products\" shall not include (i) closeout merchandise which the Company may identify as \"Deerskin\" branded items, if such is the case, nor (ii) products from the Company's Joan Cook Catalog.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Site' to 'Webpage' and 'Deerskin Products' to 'Deerskin Goods' introduces ambiguity. The contract consistently refers to 'Site' later on, so this change will cause confusion about if the term 'Webpage' is different than 'Site'. Similarly for 'Deerskin Products' and 'Deerskin Goods'.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Net Sales' to 'Net Revenue', 'Deerskin Products' to 'Deerskin Goods,' 'Site' to 'Webpage' and 'refunds and exchanges' to 'returns and discounts' creates contradiction. Are Net Sales and Net Revenue referring to the same metric, and are refunds/exchanges different than returns/discounts? This alters the financial obligations and creates grounds for disagreement on payment calculations.",

                "explanation": "The term \"Exchange Act\" is replaced with \"Regulations\". It's unclear whether \"Regulations\" refers to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or some other set of rules, which introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"revoked\" to \"terminated\", \"party\" to \"member\", and \"party\" to \"affiliate\" creates confusion. Are these terms interchangeable? The legal implications of 'termination' vs 'revocation' can be different. Similarly, 'member' and 'affiliate' introduce uncertainty about the scope of the agreement and who can revoke it.",

It is unclear if \"signatory\" means the same as \"party\" and if \"instrument\" has the same effect as \"agreement\". This introduces uncertainty about who is bound by the agreement and the legal consequences of signing the document.",

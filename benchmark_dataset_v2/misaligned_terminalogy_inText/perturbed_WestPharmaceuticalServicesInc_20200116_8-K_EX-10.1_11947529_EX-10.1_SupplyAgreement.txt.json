Seller has the right to review each purchasing specification and needs to accept in writing before such purchasing specifications become effective. Seller has the right to take exceptions to terms and provisions in these purchasing specifications if in contradiction with Seller's Sales specifications, General Terms and Condition of Sales or other Seller's procedures and policies.",

Seller has the right to review each purchasing specification and needs to accept in writing before such purchasing specifications become effective. Seller reserves the right to take exceptions to terms and provisions in these purchasing specifications only if in contradiction with Seller's Product descriptions.",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'Sales specifications, General Terms and Condition of Sales or other Seller's procedures and policies' with 'Product descriptions'. This creates confusion as 'Product descriptions' is more specific and narrower than the original clause, potentially limiting Seller's ability to take exceptions to Buyer's purchasing specifications and creating uncertainty about which document takes precedence.",

It creates uncertainty as it is not clear that 'Customer entities' refers to the same entities as 'Buyer Affiliates', and changed 'shall' to 'might', so the payment method is not fixed.",

If the term in the contract refers to 'Effective Date', it should be 'January 1, 2019'. If the contract says 'Starting Time', it should be 'January 1, 2019'. If they are different it creates a contradiction.",

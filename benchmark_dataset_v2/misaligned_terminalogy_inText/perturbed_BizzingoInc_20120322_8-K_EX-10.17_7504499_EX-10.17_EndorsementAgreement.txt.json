Theismann agrees to cooperate with Bizzzingo's promotional efforts in this regard.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Property' is being replaced with the undefined term 'Persona'. The contract defines 'Property' explicitly, but this change introduces a similar but undefined term, leading to uncertainty about the scope of rights granted to Bizzingo. This weakens the original definition.",

                "explanation": "The definition of Property now includes an ambiguity by making the inclusion of 'character, symbols, and/or other endorsement' conditional ('In certain contexts'). This introduces uncertainty about whether these elements are always included in the definition of Property.",

                "explanation": "Here the 'Property' which was defined in section 1, is now replaced with 'Persona' a term that is not defined in the text, creating confusion in the enforcement of the clause. 'Persona' is now being used to define restrictions on the Theismann's rights to publicity in the future, which can be interpreted as an in-text contradiction.",

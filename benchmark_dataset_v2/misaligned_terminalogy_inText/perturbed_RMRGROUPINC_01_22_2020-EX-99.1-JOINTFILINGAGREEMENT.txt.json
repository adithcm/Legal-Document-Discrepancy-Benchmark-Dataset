                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of us pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Filing Document with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any modifications thereto (including modifications on Form 4) approved by each of the undersigned may be, submitted on behalf of each of us pursuant to and in accordance with the guidelines of Regulation 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as interpreted.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Schedule 13G/A' with 'Filing Document', 'amendments' with 'modifications', 'Schedule 13D' with 'Form 4', 'Rule' with 'Regulation' and 'provisions' with 'guidelines' introduces uncertainty as these are distinct legal terms with specific meanings under securities law. Using them interchangeably creates ambiguity about the actual compliance requirements.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'TRUST' to 'ENTITY' and 'President' to 'Representative' without defining these terms introduces ambiguity regarding the nature of the signing party and their legal authority. A trust has a specific legal definition, whereas an entity is a broader term. Similarly, 'President' has defined corporate governance implications unlike 'Representative'.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'ADAM D. PORTNOY' to 'A. D. PORTNOY' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear if 'A. D. PORTNOY' is the same legal entity as 'ADAM D. PORTNOY'. The signature could potentially be challenged if the legal entity is incorrectly identified.",

The modified text uses 'terminable', implying the license can be terminated under certain conditions (although unspecified here, and creates conflict with subsequent articles that implicitly treat it as irrevocable until option expiry). This creates a direct contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The term 'irrevocable' has been replaced with 'terminable.' This means the Joint Improvement license can be revoked under certain circumstances. However, the contract fails to specify those circumstances. This creates uncertainty and a potential dispute about the conditions under which the license could be terminated. It also conflicts with a basic assumption that Joint Improvements once licensed continue that way.",

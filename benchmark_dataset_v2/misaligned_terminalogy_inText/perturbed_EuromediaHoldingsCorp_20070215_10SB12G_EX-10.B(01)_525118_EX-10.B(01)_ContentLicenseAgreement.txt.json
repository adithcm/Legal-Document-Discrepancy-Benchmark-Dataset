For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Retail Revenues\" means the retail revenues actually received by Rogers for each authorized exhibition of a Licensed Program on the ROD Service, less GST and applicable sales tax. For greater certainty, Retail Revenues shall not include any fees payable to Rogers for: (i) the purchase, rental or installation of a digital terminal; (ii) any basic or premium television services; or (iii) digital cable access.",

                "explanation": "Here, the term \"gross annual revenues\" is replaced by \"total annual income\". The meaning and scope of 'revenues' and 'income' are different as 'income' includes any money coming into the company, regardless whether it's profit. As the terms are being used interchangably it's difficult to determine what is considered when Rogers is determining their production fund.",

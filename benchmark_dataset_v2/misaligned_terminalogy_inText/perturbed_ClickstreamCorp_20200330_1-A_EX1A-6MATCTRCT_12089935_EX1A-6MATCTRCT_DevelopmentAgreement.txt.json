                "original_text": "WHEREAS, the Client wishes to engage the Developer as an independent contractor for the Client for the purpose of designing the Client's application (the \"Application\") on the terms and conditions set forth below; and WHEREAS, the Developer wishes to design the Application and agrees to do so under the terms and conditions of this Agreement",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Client wishes to engage the Developer as an independent contractor for the Client for the purpose of designing the Client's application (the \"Software\") on the terms and conditions set forth below; and WHEREAS, the Developer wishes to design the Application and agrees to do so under the terms and conditions of this Agreement",
                "explanation": "Changing \"Application\" to \"Software\" in one of the WHEREAS clauses introduces confusion. The contract predominantly refers to the deliverable as the 'Application,' but using 'Software' interchangeably creates ambiguity about the exact scope and nature of the deliverable, leading to potential disputes over what the Developer is obligated to deliver.",

The Developer may not, without the written consent of the Client, assign, subcontract, or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, except that the Developer may transfer the right to receive any amounts that may be payable to it for its Services under this Agreement, which transfer will be effective only after receipt by the Client of written notice of such assignment or transfer.",

The Vendor may not, without the written consent of the Client, assign, subcontract, or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, except that the Developer may transfer the right to receive any amounts that may be payable to it for its Services under this Agreement, which transfer will be effective only after receipt by the Client of written notice of such assignment or transfer.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Developer' to 'Vendor' in the second sentence creates uncertainty. It becomes unclear whether 'Vendor' refers to the same entity as 'Developer,' potentially affecting the assignment restrictions and creating confusion about which party is bound by these limitations. This introduces potential grounds for disputes regarding contract assignment.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Developer' with its full name 'InfinixSoft Global LLC' in the payment section creates confusion because the following line references the shares being accepted by 'Developer'. This implies a distinction where no clear difference exists, casting doubt on whether the correct entity received consideration for the services and the terms of the stock transfer.",

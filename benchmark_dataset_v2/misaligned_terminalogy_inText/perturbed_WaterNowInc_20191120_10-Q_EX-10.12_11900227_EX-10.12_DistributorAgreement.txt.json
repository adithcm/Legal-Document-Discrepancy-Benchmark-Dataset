The fulfillment of the Performance Benchmarks will be a factor when considering renewal.",

The changed text makes meeting those benchmarks merely a factor for renewal, weakening the obligation and creating ambiguity about whether failing to meet them automatically forfeits exclusivity during the Initial Term.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' is replaced with 'Vendor' in the opening sentence. Throughout the rest of the document, the entity is referred to as 'Distributor.' This creates confusion as to whether 'Vendor' and 'Distributor' are the same entity, impacting obligations and rights.",

Company                   warrants  that the Products  will be  designed,  manufactured,                   constructed,  assembled and packaged in a  workmanlike  manner                   and that such Products  shall be fully  functional and fit for                   their intended  purposes.  Company  further  warrants that the                   Products sold hereunder  shall be free from defects in design,                   materials and  workmanship  for a period of  twenty-four  (24)                   months after delivery to Distributor's  end-user.  The Company                   shall not be liable for defective Products, except as provided                   in this  Agreement.  The Distributor at all times shall comply                   with all  requirements of the  Magnuson-Moss  Warranty-Federal                   Trade Commission Improvement Act and similar federal and state                   laws and regulations.",

Company guarantees that the Products will be designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled, and packaged using best industry practices, and that the items will be completely functional and suitable for the uses for which they were intended. Company further assures that the items offered for sale below will be devoid of any flaws in their design, components, and production for a duration of six (6) months following the date of delivery to the Distributor's end-user. The Corporation bears no liability for flawed Items, except in situations covered in this Agreement. The Distributor shall always follow all guidelines outlined in the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, along with similar federal and state regulations.",
                "explanation": "The term 'warrants' is changed to 'guarantees' and 'assures' while also modifying the warranty period from twenty-four months to six months. This creates an internal inconsistency regarding the actual warranty offered, potentially invalidating or causing ambiguity in the enforceability of the warranty clause.",

In the event that either Distributor or                   Company fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement, both                   Distributor and Company acknowledge and agree that in addition                   to any claim for damages  either  party may have  arising from                   the  default of the  other,  they shall have the right to seek                   equitable  relief  by way of a  temporary  restraining  order,                   preliminary  injunction,  permanent  injunction and such other                   equitable  relief as may be appropriate.  In the event a party                   seeks the equitable relief of a temporary  restraining  order,                   preliminary   injunction,   permanent  injunction,   mandatory\n                  injunction or specific  performance  both parties  acknowledge                   that they shall not be required to demonstrate  the absence of                   an adequate remedy at law, and neither party shall be required                   to post  bond  as a  precondition  to  obtaining  a  temporary                   restraining order or preliminary  injunction.  The termination                   of this  Agreement  shall not relieve either party hereto from                   obligations  which have occurred pursuant to the provisions of                   this Agreement prior to its termination,  nor shall it release                   either  party  hereto  from any  obligations  which  have been                   incurred  as a  result  of  operations  conducted  under  this                   Agreement.",

In the event that either Distributor or Company fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement, both Distributor and Company acknowledge and agree that in addition to any claim for damages either party may have arising from the default of the other, they shall have the right to seek appropriate resolution. In the event a party seeks an appropriate resolution, both parties acknowledge that they shall be required to demonstrate the absence of an adequate remedy at law, and parties are required to post bond as a precondition to obtaining a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. The termination of this Agreement shall not relieve either party hereto from obligations which have occurred pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement prior to its termination, nor shall it release either party hereto from any obligations which have been incurred as a result of operations conducted under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changes 'equitable relief' to 'appropriate resolution,' which is vague. Also, it removes language stating the parties are *not* required to prove a lack of remedy at law and *are not* required to post bond before relief. This creates a contradiction regarding conditions for seeking remedies.",

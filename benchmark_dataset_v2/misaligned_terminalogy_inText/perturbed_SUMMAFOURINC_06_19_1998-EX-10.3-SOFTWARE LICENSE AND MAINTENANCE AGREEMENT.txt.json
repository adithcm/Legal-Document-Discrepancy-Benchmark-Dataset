                "original_text": "D2 agrees to indemnify and hold LICENSEE harmless against any cost, loss, liability, or expense (including attorney's fees) arising out of any breach of D2's warranties hereunder, or out of third party claims against LICENSEE alleging that the Licensed Technology, or LICENSEE's use or distribution of the Licensed Technology as set forth in this Agreement, infringes any third party's patent, trade secret, copyright of other intellectual property right in any country, provided that LICENSEE shall (i) notify D2 promptly in writing of such claims, and (ii) give D2 sole control of the defense or settlement of such claims.",
                "changed_text": "D2 agrees to indemnify and hold Summa Four Inc. harmless against any cost, loss, liability, or expense (including attorney's fees) arising out of any breach of D2's warranties hereunder, or out of third party claims against LICENSEE alleging that the Licensed Technology, or LICENSEE's use or distribution of the Licensed Technology as set forth in this Agreement, infringes any third party's patent, trade secret, copyright of other intellectual property right in any country, provided that LICENSEE shall (i) notify D2 promptly in writing of such claims, and (ii) give D2 sole control of the defense or settlement of such claims.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces 'Summa Four Inc.' in place of LICENSEE to indicate who D2 will indemnify. Since the term LICENSEE is previously defined in section 1 to be Summa Four Inc., this should not be repeated in further sections, or it will introduce confusion in enforcement and creates a contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses the term “LICENSEE”. The replacement of 'LICENSEE' with “Customer” introduces another term and causes confusion about who has the right to terminate the agreement, LICENSEE or Customer or are they both the same? It creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The change of 'LICENSEE' to 'Distributor' without defining the terms leads to confusion. It's unclear if 'LICENSEE' and 'Distributor' refer to the same entity. This makes it uncertain who is responsible for complying with export regulations.",

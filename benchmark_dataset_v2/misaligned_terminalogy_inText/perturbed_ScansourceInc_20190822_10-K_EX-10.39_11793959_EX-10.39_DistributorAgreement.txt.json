The above-referenced cap shall be determined based on all Product purchases made under this Agreement. The responsibility to manage the Balancing Cap shall rest solely upon Distributor. Distributor shall be entitled to return Product once per quarter, provided such returns do not exceed the Balancing Cap. \"Dead on Arrival\" and Obsolete Products returned pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement shall be excluded from calculation of the Balancing Cap.

                "explanation": "Interchanging 'Distributor' and 'ScanSource' creates uncertainty.

The responsibility is on the 'Distributor' but the capability to return is afforded to 'ScanSource'.",

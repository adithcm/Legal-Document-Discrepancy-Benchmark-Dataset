(\"Administrator\"), a Connecticut corporation.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Fund\" is replaced with \"Portfolio\". Later references to the \"Fund\" will create confusion as to whether \"Fund\" and \"Portfolio\" are referring to the same entity, especially regarding obligations tied to one or the other.",

                "explanation": "Here, \"Funds\" is replaced with \"Portfolios\", but the subsequent references use both \"Investment Vehicle\" and \"Portfolio\". The term \"Fund\" from the original agreement is no longer used. It’s unclear if \"Portfolio\" and \"Investment Vehicle\" are the same entity and how they relate to the original \"Fund\". This creates ambiguity in the order execution process.",

                "explanation": "The terms “Fund”, “Portfolio” and “Investment Vehicle” are used seemingly interchangeably, when they may or may not be the same thing. This makes the financial obligations of the Trust less clear as to which entities are covered.",

                "original_text": "Licensee shall pay Fox a non-refundable recoupable advance in the amount of US$***** upon Licensee's signature of this Agreement (the \"Advance\"). The Advance shall be treated as the first installment of the Guarantee described in Section 6(a), and will be recoupable against royalties as part of the Guarantee.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee may provide Fox a payment, that is not guaranteed, in the amount of US$***** upon Licensee's signature of this Agreement (the \"Advance\"). The Advance may or may not be considered as part of a total payment, and recoupment is subject to Fox's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the Advance as non-refundable and recoupable, essentially a guaranteed payment. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating it's 'not guaranteed' and 'recoupment is subject to Fox's discretion', contradicting the original firm commitment.",

                "original_text": "Unless otherwise mutually agreed between Fox and Licensee, Licensee will require each Licensed CSP to distribute Wireless Products to end users only for the payment of a fee; provided that Licensee may permit limited distribution (i.e. one Wireless Product per Property in each category of Wireless Products and including only one game level for each game) of Wireless Products without a fee for promotional or marketing purposes. The fees will typically appear on the end user's Wireless Platform bill and be remitted by the end user to the CSP pursuant to an agreement between the end user and the CSP. The CSP will in turn remit fees to Licensee (less any Deductions as that term is defined in Paragraph 7(a)(ii) below) pursuant to an agreement between Licensee and the CSP. Licensee will then remit royalties to Fox in accordance with Paragraph 7, below.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise mutually agreed between Fox and Licensee, Licensee has discretion to allow each Licensed CSP to distribute Wireless Products to end users, but the distribution model is not obligated to involve fees. Licensee may permit free or paid distribution, as they deem fit. Fees, if any, may or may not appear on the end user's Wireless Platform statement, and the remittance structure is variable and subject to the arrangements between Licensee and each CSP. The CSP has no strict obligation to remit fees to Licensee, as the distribution arrangements are flexible. Licensee will then remit royalties to Fox in accordance with Paragraph 7, below, but the remittance of fees is not enforced if there are no distribution fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates fees for distribution, with limited exceptions for promotional purposes. The modified version makes the fee structure entirely discretionary, contradicting the original requirement and creating ambiguity about how Fox will receive royalties.",

Licensee shall create, execute and deliver to Fox all documents and instruments reasonably required by Fox for the protection of or otherwise in connection with the copyrights, trademarks and service marks of Fox. Licensee shall not have the right to use Fox's trademarks or trade names except in connection with the promotion and distribution of the Wireless Products in the Territory in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may include a notice for the Licensee Materials, where appropriate.",
                "changed_text": "All goodwill and reputation attaching to such copyrights, trademarks and service marks may vest in Fox, subject to Licensee's contributions to such goodwill. Licensee is encouraged, but not obligated, to deliver to Fox documents related to Fox's IP. Licensee may utilize Fox's trademarks to a degree that aligns with market standards, and Fox's approval is not required. Licensee maintains rights to the Licensee Materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text asserts Fox's absolute ownership of goodwill and restricts Licensee's use of Fox's trademarks. The modified version introduces ambiguity about goodwill ownership ('may vest'), weakens Licensee's obligation to deliver documents, and grants Licensee more freedom to use Fox's trademarks, thus contradicting the original text.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Annual' has been changed to 'yearly'. Although they seem identical, legally and practically they are not. Changing 'Annual' to 'yearly' introduces potential ambiguity and contradiction, especially in regulated contexts where 'Annual' has a specific meaning tied to regulatory reporting cycles. The contract uses 'Annual' in other sections, so using 'yearly' creates confusion.",

                "explanation": "The term 'period' has been changed to 'timeframe'. While seemingly synonymous, consistent use of 'period' throughout the contract establishes a specific meaning. Changing it to 'timeframe' introduces ambiguity, especially if other clauses rely on a precise interpretation of 'period' for calculating deadlines or obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Forum' to 'Venue' introduces potential ambiguity and contradiction in legal context. 'Forum' generally refers to any place where legal recourse takes place. While 'Venue' is a term referring to a place where a case is heard. They are slightly different in legal aspects, and changing the term may make the contract ambiguous.",

Supplier, in its sole discretion, will make a determination of the necessity of a recall, market withdrawal, inventory retrieval or other action designed to prevent the distribution or sale of the Ingredients.

                "explanation": "Changing 'Ingredients' to 'Components', 'Defect' to 'Problem', 'Finished Products' to 'Retail Items' and 'Recall' to 'Return' in the recall section creates significant confusion.

Also, the use of 'Return' vs 'Recall' may cause uncertainty about the process and scope of the required action and liability.",

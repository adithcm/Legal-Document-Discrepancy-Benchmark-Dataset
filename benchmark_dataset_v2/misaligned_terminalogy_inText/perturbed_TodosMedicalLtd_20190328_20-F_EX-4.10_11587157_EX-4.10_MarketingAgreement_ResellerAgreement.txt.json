                "explanation": "The terms 'Reseller', 'Distributor', 'Customers', and 'Clients' are used interchangeably. The definition of Reseller grants it the right to sub-license or transfer its rights. However, if 'Distributor' is a separate entity, it is unclear whether the reseller's right applies to them.",

Additionally, Todos will provide the Vendor with training relating to the handling of all blood samples throughout the screening process, and any and all other training, guidance and support reasonably required to sell the Goods in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Products' and 'Goods' are used interchangeably, while 'Reseller' and 'Vendor' are also now interchanged. This creates confusion as to what exactly Todos is providing training on, and to whom. The initial training is described for Products but later shifted to Goods and the training recipient shifted to Vendor. Are they the same, or different things?",

This creates confusion as to what is expected from the original 'Reseller', since new terminology implies a different role and product.",

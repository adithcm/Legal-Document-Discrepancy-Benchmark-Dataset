                "original_text": "WHEREAS, EZJR currently owns a Customer Relationship Management (\"CRM\") software program as developed by LEADER; and   WHEREAS, upon the purchase of the software EZJR entered into an agreement for LEADER to maintain the software for a period of two years after which LEADER was be paid by EZJR to service and maintain the software; and   WHEREAS, this previous agreement expired on May 28, 2016;",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Customer Relationship Management (CRM)' is replaced with 'Customer Engagement Platform (CEP)'. The term 'software' is replaced with 'application'. And the word 'paid' is replaced with 'may be compensated.' By using different terms for the same concept, the agreement introduces ambiguity and confusion about the precise subject matter and creates uncertainty around the obligations of payment to LEADER.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'SERVICE AGREEMENT' is replaced with 'MAINTENANCE'. The term 'software' is replaced with 'platform.' The term 'compensation' is replaced with 'payment'. And, finally, add 'or some other equitable settlement'. These replacements and additions could cause confusion, as the exact services and consideration are left vague and undefined.",

If any action is brought among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, by way of a claim or counterclaim, the parties agree that in any such action, and on all issues, the parties irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such action shall be the State Courts of Nevada.",

If any suit is initiated among the parties with respect to this Agreement or otherwise, whether a claim or counterclaim, the parties concur that in any such suit, and on some issues, the parties voluntarily relinquish their entitlement to a jury trial. Jurisdiction and venue for any such suit should ideally be in the State Courts of Nevada.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'governed by the laws' with 'interpreted according to the principles of law' introduces uncertainty regarding the application of Nevada law. Switching 'action' to 'suit,' 'agree' to 'concur,' and 'irrevocably waive their right' to 'voluntarily relinquish their entitlement' weakens the binding nature of the jury trial waiver. The addition of 'should ideally be' weakens the jurisdiction and venue clause, making it less mandatory.",

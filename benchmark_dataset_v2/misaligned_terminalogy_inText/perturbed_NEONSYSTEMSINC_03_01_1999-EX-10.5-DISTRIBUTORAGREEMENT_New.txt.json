                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensee' to 'Vendor' creates confusion about the parties. The agreement is initially made between the 'Licensor' and the 'Licensee', but later sections might imply the 'Vendor' has different obligations, leading to uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "Here, the 'Licensee' is expected to pay 50% but the 'Vendor' is only contracted to pay 25%. This creates contradictory financial obligations. It also makes the mention of Licensee at the end ambiguous because it is unclear whether they are the same entity or not.",

                "explanation": "Using 'Distributor' introduces further ambiguity. Although a 'Distributor Agreement', this section suddenly uses 'Distributor', which is then immediately followed by 'Licensee' and creates an additional layer of uncertainty about who is responsible for performing the obligations. It is unclear whether the Licensee and the Distributor are the same entity.",

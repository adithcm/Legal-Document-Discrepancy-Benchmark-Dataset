Upon successful completion of the Development and Manufacturing Phase and upon receipt of the applicable Regulatory Approval in a given country in the Territory required in order to sell the Assay in such country, Microgenics shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to exclusively commercialize and market the Assay, under the Thermo Scientific tradename and packaging and utilizing Microgenics' and its Affiliate's commercial infrastructure, in each country within the Territory in which Achaogen is commercializing Plazomicin for so long as Achaogen is commercializing Plazomicin in such country.",

Upon successful completion of the Development and Manufacturing Phase and upon receipt of the applicable Regulatory Approval in a given country in the Territory required in order to sell the Assay in such country, Microgenics will attempt to commercialize and market the Assay under a mutually agreed-upon tradename and packaging, utilizing its distribution channels, in each country within the Territory where Achaogen is marketing Plazomicin.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces a standard ('Commercially Reasonable Efforts') for 'exclusively commercializing and marketing' the Assay. The changed text replaces 'shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to exclusively commercialize and market' with 'will attempt to commercialize and market', weakening the obligation and removing the standard for the action, thus creating uncertainty in the enforcement.",

Achaogen and Microgenics shall [***] coordinate the therapeutic and diagnostic regulatory filings and communications with Regulatory Authorities in the Territory. Achaogen will be responsible for all activities regarding the Regulatory Approval of Plazomicin (and, as between the Parties, Achaogen shall retain ownership of all regulatory filings and Regulatory Approvals for Plazomicin), and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  [***] will be responsible for all activities regarding the Regulatory Approval of [***] (and, as between the Parties, [***] shall retain ownership of all regulatory filings and Regulatory Approvals for [***]).",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall coordinate', which implies a mandatory action to coordinate the therapeutic and diagnostic regulatory filings. The changed text replaces it with 'may coordinate, as deemed necessary', making it a discretionary action, thus contradicting the initial mandatory tone.

The modified text changes 'shall be managed' to 'may establish...for advisory purposes,' making the existence of the JSC optional and its role advisory only. This contradicts the original text's directive and introduces uncertainty about the management structure.",

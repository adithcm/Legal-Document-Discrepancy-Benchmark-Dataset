                "explanation": "The term 'sublicense' is replaced with 'authorize.' While seemingly similar, 'sublicense' implies a specific grant of rights, while 'authorize' is more vague. This creates uncertainty about the extent of the rights being granted and how the original agreement is interpreted.",

                "explanation": "The term 'right' is replaced with 'ability.' 'Right' implies a legal entitlement, while 'ability' suggests merely the capacity to act. This creates uncertainty as to whether the parties are legally entitled to bring proceedings or simply have the physical capacity, weakening enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The term 'agrees to indemnify' is replaced with 'may protect.' The former is a clear obligation, the later is optional and less certain. This weakens the indemnification clause and creates ambiguity about the indemnifying party's responsibility to cover losses.",

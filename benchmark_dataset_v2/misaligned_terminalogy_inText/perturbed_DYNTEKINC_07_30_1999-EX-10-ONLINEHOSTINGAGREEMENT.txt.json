                "original_text": "Tadeo shall provide, directly or through a third party vendor reasonably satisfactory to Diplomat, the Online Hosting Services described on EXHIBIT A hereto, at the cost specified and on the other terms and conditions as set forth on EXHIBIT A.",

                "explanation": "Changing the reference from 'EXHIBIT A' to 'EXHIBIT B' for the terms and conditions of the services creates a contradiction, as the services and their conditions are now defined in two different exhibits (A and B) creating uncertainty for enforcement. As EXHIBIT B does not exist, it is uncertain which terms and conditions should apply.",

                "original_text": "Diplomat will pay to Tadeo when due a fee for each of the Services equal to the amount described in EXHIBIT A hereto relating to each such Service; PROVIDED, that in the event Diplomat terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 3 hereof, the fee for the provision of each\n\n- 2 -\n\nterminated Service shall cease to accrue on and after the effective date of such termination.",
                "changed_text": "Diplomat will pay to Tadeo when due a fee for each of the Services equal to the amount described in EXHIBIT A hereto relating to each such Service; PROVIDED, that in the event Diplomat cancels this Agreement in accordance with Section 3 hereof, the compensation for the provision of each\n\n- 2 -\n\nended Service shall cease to accrue on and after the effective date of such cancellation.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'terminates' with 'cancels' and 'terminated Service' with 'ended Service' introduces inconsistent terminology for the same action (ending the agreement), potentially leading to disputes regarding the implications of each term. It is uncertain whether 'cancel' and 'end' have different implications.",

Diplomat may, at its own expense, examine and copy those books and records as provided in this Section 4. Such books, records and accounts will be maintained in a manner that allows Diplomat to separate these matters from those relating to Tadeo's other operations. Such books, records and accounts will reflect such information as would normally be examined by an independent accountant in performing an audit pursuant to United States generally accepted auditing standards for the purpose of certifying financial statements, and to permit verification thereof by governmental agencies. Diplomat may make examinations pursuant hereto during Tadeo's usual business hours, and at the place in the continental United States where Tadeo regularly keeps these books and records. Diplomat will be required to notify Tadeo at least five business days before the date of planned examination. If Diplomat's examination is not completed within one month from commencement, Tadeo at any time may require Diplomat to terminate such examination on\n\n- 5 -\n\nseven days' notice to Diplomat; PROVIDED that Tadeo has cooperated with Diplomat in the examination of such books and records.",

Diplomat may make inspections pursuant hereto during Tadeo's usual business hours, and at the place in the continental United States where Tadeo regularly keeps these books and records. Diplomat will be required to notify Tadeo at least five business days before the date of planned examination. If Diplomat's investigation is not completed within one month from commencement, Tadeo at any time may require Diplomat to end such examination on\n\n- 5 -\n\nseven days' notice to Diplomat; PROVIDED that Tadeo has cooperated with Diplomat in the examination of such books and records.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'governmental agencies' to 'regulatory bodies', 'examinations' to 'inspections', and 'examination' to 'investigation' creates ambiguity in the scope and process of Diplomat's access to Tadeo's records. It's unclear whether the 'investigation' has the same requirements or implications as the 'examination', creating a contradiction. It also brings confusion whether this means the same activity with those changes.",

                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. For purposes of this definition, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. Allscripts' Affiliates may exercise Allscripts' rights and fulfill its related obligations under this Agreement, provided that Allscripts shall be responsible for any breach of such obligations by its Affiliates to the same extent as if Allscripts was the breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "\"Subsidiary\" means, with respect to a Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person.

                "explanation": "Changing Affiliate to Subsidiary in the definition introduces confusion. While the definition of control remains, the term 'Subsidiary' typically implies a specific ownership structure, whereas 'Affiliate' is broader. This contradiction can lead to disputes over which entities are bound by the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Customer' to 'Consumer' implies a different type of relationship, typically one focused on individual use rather than business-to-business. This change can lead to disputes over the obligations Allscripts owes to these 'Consumers' vs the obligations outlined for 'Customers' elsewhere.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Warranties' to 'Guarantees' in the disclaimer introduces ambiguity. While both aim to assure quality, 'Guarantees' can be interpreted more strictly, suggesting an absolute promise rather than a conditional assurance, which is the intent of the original warranty. This could cause disagreements on the extent of liability.",

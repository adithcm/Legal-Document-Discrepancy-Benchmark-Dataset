                "explanation": "The term 'Chief Executive Officer' is replaced with 'Chief Administrator Officer'. This introduces ambiguity as it's not clear whether these roles are equivalent, and the rest of the document refers only to CEO.",

If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on five days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice. The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon.",

If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on five days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to leave the agreement at any time with no prior written notice. The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon.",
                "explanation": "The term 'resign' is replaced with 'leave the agreement' and the notice period changes from 30 days to none. This creates a contradiction about the conditions required for Maimon to end the agreement.",

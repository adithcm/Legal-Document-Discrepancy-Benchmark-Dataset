                "explanation": "Changed 'Licensee' to 'Recipient' and 'license' to 'permit.' This introduces ambiguity regarding who is allowed to use the domain names and what right is granted for domain name use. 'Recipient' is already defined as a party receiving Confidential Information in Section 9.1, and 'permit' is undefined, leading to confusion.",

                "explanation": "Replaced 'Licensee' with 'Client' and 'license' with 'authorization'. Now, it's unclear whether 'Client' is the same as 'Licensee' or a new role. Furthermore, 'authorization' is not precisely defined as a formal grant of rights like a license, creating a contradiction with later sections and causing uncertainty around the user's rights.",

The recipient is defined in Section 9.1 in the context of Confidential Information, but not in the context of operational and legal compliance for the business. This creates a contradiction because it's unclear whether 'the recipient' of Confidential Information is now also responsible for business compliance.",

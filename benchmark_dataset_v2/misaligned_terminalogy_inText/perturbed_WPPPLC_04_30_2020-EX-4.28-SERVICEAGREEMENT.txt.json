There is no period of previous employment with the Company.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Appointment' to 'Start Date' and 'Executive' to 'Employee' creates ambiguity about whether these terms refer to the same concept, especially if 'Firm' is used rather than 'Company'.",

The salary (and so far, as is reasonably possible) the benefits allowance will accrue from day to day and be payable in equal instalments in arrears on or around the 25th day of every month, less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions and shall be inclusive of any fees receivable by the Executive as a director of any Group Company.",

The compensation (and so far, as is reasonably possible) the benefits allotment will accrue from day to day and be payable in equal instalments in arrears on or around the 25th day of every month, less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions and shall be inclusive of any fees receivable by the Executive as a director of any Group Company.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Company' to 'Corporation', 'Executive' to 'Employee', 'salary' to 'compensation' and 'allowance' to 'allotment' introduces terminology misalignment, implying different roles or benefits. The change from allowance to allotment could have financial implications.",

If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions.",

If the Company chooses to end the individual's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Employee would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Appointment' to 'Contract', 'terminated' to 'discontinued', 'Company' to 'Firm', 'Executive' to 'Personnel' and 'end' in one part, causes confusion regarding the conditions under which the contract can be dissolved and who holds the authority to terminate. It is also not specific of who is an individual vs. the Personnel.",

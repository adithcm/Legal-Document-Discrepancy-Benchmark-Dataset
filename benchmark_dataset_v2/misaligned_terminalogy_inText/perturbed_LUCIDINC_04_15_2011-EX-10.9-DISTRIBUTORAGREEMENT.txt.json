                "explanation": "Changing 'Distributor' to 'Retailer' creates uncertainty. Throughout the agreement, the term 'Distributor' is used. By introducing 'Retailer' in this section, it is unclear whether the appointed entity is operating under the same terms and conditions as the distributor.",

                "explanation": "The contract consistently refers to 'Product Manager.' Replacing it with 'Product Specialist' introduces ambiguity. It is unclear if a 'Product Specialist' has the same responsibilities and authority as a 'Product Manager' under the agreement, potentially leading to disputes over performance expectations.",

                "explanation": "Interchanging the word 'incident' with the word 'emergencies' creates a misaligned terminology. The word incident is defined and used in other parts of the contract, so introducing emergencies, will create confusion as to what to report. It causes in-text contradiction by not specifying when reporting an incident would be an emergency.",

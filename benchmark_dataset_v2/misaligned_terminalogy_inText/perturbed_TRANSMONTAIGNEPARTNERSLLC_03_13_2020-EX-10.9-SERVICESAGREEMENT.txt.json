The Operating Company shall reimburse EmployeeCo for all direct or indirect costs and expenses incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) salaries of the Services Employees;\n\n(b) the cost of employee benefits for the Services Employees, including 401(k), pension, bonuses and health insurance benefits (whether through insurance policies provided by third-parties or self-insurance);\n\n(c) costs associated with workers' compensation claims and other disputes or liabilities associated with the Services Employees;\n\n(d) severance costs with respect to any terminated Services Employees; and",

It's not clear whether \"Staff\" and \"Services Employees\" are distinct groups, and what benefits are included under 'personnel benefits' for 'Services Employees.'

This introduces a contradiction, as it's unclear whether the Operating Company also has the right to terminate. This creates uncertainty regarding the termination rights of each party and could lead to disputes.",

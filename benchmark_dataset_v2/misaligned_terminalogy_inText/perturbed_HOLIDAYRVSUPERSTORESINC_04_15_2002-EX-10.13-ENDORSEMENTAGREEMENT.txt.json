AGI hereby grants a non-exclusive license (the \"License\") to the Company and its operating subsidiaries now or hereafter existing to use the Good Sam name and logo, including trademarks, trade names, or service marks as designated by AGI (the \"Trademarks\"), in connection with the sale of such new and used vehicles by the Company that have satisfied such criteria and standards as are established from time to time by AGI (the \"Approved Use\"). AGI warrants that it has the right and ability to grant the License to the Company to use the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant will not infringe upon the rights of any other party.",

                "explanation": "The term 'License' is defined as a 'non-exclusive license,' however, I have changed the initial use of the word License to 'permission'. While the definition remains as license, the interchangeable use of permission introduces confusion as to whether AGI is granting an actual license or simply granting permission.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'hold out' is replaced with 'promote' in the context of having the License or Endorsement. This creates ambiguity because 'hold out' implies a representation of fact, while 'promote' implies marketing or advertising. This can cause confusion about the company's obligations regarding the Endorsement.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days' written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'voting securities', which is replaced with 'voting shares'. Although seemingly similar, 'securities' can include debt instruments while 'shares' usually refers only to equity. The notice period for Integrity is also reduced from 90 to 30 days, creating a contradiction in termination terms, and potentially leading to disputes over the correct termination procedure.",

                "explanation": "The original text identifies Shannon D. Radke as 'President' of Integrity Funds Distributor, LLC. The modified version changes the title to 'Vice President'. If this person's actual authority requires them to be the president for the agreement to be valid, this change introduces uncertainty about the agreement's enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and directors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and *managers*, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or *supervisors*, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund's representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text consistently uses 'officers and governors'. The changed text replaces 'governors' with 'directors', then introduces 'managers' and 'supervisors' within the same sentence. This creates confusion as to which individuals within Integrity are actually indemnified. The terms are not defined, leading to ambiguity about the scope of indemnification and potentially limiting liability where it was originally intended.",

It becomes unclear whether the Distributor and the Remarketing Intermediary are distinct entities or if the terms are used interchangeably, leading to potential disputes over obligations.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Remarketing Agent' with 'Remarketing Servicer' and 'Liquidator' introduces inconsistencies. The definition of the appointed entity's role remains tied to 'remarketing,' yet the designated term has shifted to 'Liquidator,' which usually refers to asset liquidation. This creates a contradiction regarding the actual duties and responsibilities of the appointed party.",

                "explanation": "Changing the term 'Remarketing Agent' to 'Sales Agent' and 'Indemnified Persons' to 'Protected Persons' creates a contradiction. While the obligations remain tied to the 'Remarketing Materials', the entity being indemnified is now called the 'Sales Agent'. If the 'Sales Agent' is a different entity than the 'Remarketing Agent,' it is unclear whether the Sales Agent has any obligations or responsibilities related to the 'Remarketing Materials', or if they are even responsible for remarketing in the first place, raising questions about the scope of indemnification.",

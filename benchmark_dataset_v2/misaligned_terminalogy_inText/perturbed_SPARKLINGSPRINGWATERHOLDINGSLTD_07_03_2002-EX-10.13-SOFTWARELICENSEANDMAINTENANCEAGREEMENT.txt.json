                "explanation": "The terms 'license' and 'procure' are used interchangeably, causing confusion. 'License' implies granting rights, while 'procure' implies obtaining goods, blurring the nature of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'fees' and 'charges' are used interchangeably. While often synonymous, their interchangeable use in this section implies there is no explicit process regarding which is valid, which could lead to conflict about what has to be remitted to Garman. Remit is being used instead of pay here as well.",

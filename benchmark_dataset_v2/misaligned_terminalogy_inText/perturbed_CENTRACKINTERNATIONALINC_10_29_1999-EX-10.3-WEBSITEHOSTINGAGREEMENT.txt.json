The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",

The Client acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "explanation": "The section title now uses \"Client,\" but the text inside uses both \"Customer\" and \"Client.\" This creates confusion as to which entity is ultimately responsible for payments. It becomes ambiguous whether the responsibilities outlined apply to only the 'Client', only the 'Customer,' or both.",

                "explanation": "This section specifies that the 'Client' remains obligated to pay upon termination, despite the earlier sections using both 'Client' and 'Customer' to define payment responsibilities. This creates a direct contradiction that makes the agreement difficult to enforce.",

FCE will promptly disclose to ExxonMobil, in written or other tangible form, any and all Program Information including any Program Inventions. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, FCE agrees to hold Program Information in confidence, and not to disclose or make it available to any third party without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending twenty (20) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, FCE agrees to use and practice Program Information only for the Program or as authorized in Article 7 (License to Program Results).",

FCE will promptly disclose to ExxonMobil, in written or other tangible form, any and all Program Data including any Program Discoveries. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, FCE agrees to hold Program Information in confidence, and not to disclose or make it available to any third party without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending ten (10) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, FCE agrees to use and practice Program Information only for internal purposes.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Program Information' has been changed to 'Program Data' and 'Program Discoveries,' and the restriction period reduced from twenty years to ten years. FCE's use is limited to internal purposes, creating contradiction with FCEâ€™s authorized use of Program Information as stated in Article 7. This creates uncertainty in enforcement regarding the extent and duration of confidentiality obligations and what FCE can do with said information.",

Research Costs of FCE paid for by ExxonMobil will be limited to FTE Costs for time actually spent on the Program and Direct Costs actually incurred and approved in advance by the Steering Committee. The cumulative Research Costs for the Program will not exceed forty-five million United States dollars ($45,000,000 USD) over the Term of the Agreement (\"Total Research Cost\"). ExxonMobil will reimburse FCE for Research Costs after receipt of invoices on a monthly basis. Invoices for Direct Costs will be supported by relevant third party invoices received by FCE documenting such costs. Materials shall be invoiced as incurred and subject to a thirty percent (30%) service fee. All such payments will be made after ExxonMobil's receipt of invoices in accordance with the invoicing procedures specified in Paragraphs 10.01(b)-(e) and in Paragraph 10.04 (Invoices).",

Project Expenses of FCE paid for by ExxonMobil will be limited to FTE Costs for time actually spent on the Program and Overhead Costs as determined by ExxonMobil. The cumulative Project Expenses for the Program will not exceed thirty million United States dollars ($30,000,000 USD) over the Term of the Agreement (\"Total Research Cost\"). ExxonMobil will reimburse FCE for Project Expenses after receipt of invoices on a quarterly basis.

                "explanation": "The terms 'Research Costs' is replaced by 'Project Expenses', 'Direct Costs' with 'Overhead Costs'. The method for reimbursement changes from monthly to quarterly. The cost limit is dropped from 45 to 30 million USD. ExxonMobil determines overhead costs instead of the steering committee. The requirement of third-party invoices is removed, and service fees are eliminated. 'ExxonMobil's receipt of invoices' is replaced with 'ExxonMobil's internal approval'. This causes potential contradictions in how FCE is compensated, leading to disputes.",

                "original_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity of filing additional joint filing agreements.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby consent to the joint submission of the Declaration on Form 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is annexed, and modifications thereto may be lodged without the requirement of lodging further joint filing agreements.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D' is changed to 'consent to the joint submission of the Declaration on Form 13D' and 'amendments thereto may be filed' is changed to 'modifications thereto may be lodged'. This introduces ambiguity as the document fails to clarify if 'Statement on Schedule 13D' and 'Declaration on Form 13D' are referring to the same document, and whether 'filing' and 'lodging' are interchangeable terms with same legal implications.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Joint Filing Agreement' is changed to 'Joint Submission Accord', 'executed' to 'signed', 'counterparts' to 'duplicates', 'deemed an original' to 'considered a genuine', and 'instrument' to 'tool'. This introduces inconsistency by failing to clarify that a Joint Filing Agreement and a Joint Submission Accord are the same thing. The document also does not define 'tool'.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'execution and filing of this agreement' is changed to 'signing and lodging of this arrangement' and 'below-named parties' to 'subsequently mentioned individuals', 'group' to 'team'. This creates a potential internal contradiction because it does not clarify if agreement and arrangement are the same thing, whether lodging is equivalent to filing, and whether team is another word for group.",

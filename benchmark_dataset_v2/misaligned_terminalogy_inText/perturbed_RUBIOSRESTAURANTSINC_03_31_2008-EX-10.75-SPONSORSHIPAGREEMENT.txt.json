                "original_text": "Sponsor shall pay $*** to SDBF pursuant to the following: $ *** due on or before April 30, 2008 $ *** due on or before June 30, 2008 $ *** due on or before August 31, 2008",

                "explanation": "Changing 'pay' to 'remit' introduces a subtle ambiguity. While generally synonymous, 'remit' can sometimes imply a slightly different method or obligation, potentially causing confusion if the contract relies heavily on the specific interpretation of 'pay'.",

                "original_text": "In consideration of the Sponsorship Benefits to be furnished by SDBF to Sponsor hereunder, Sponsor shall pay to SDBF the Annual Payments set forth in the Agreement Summary on the dates set forth therein. Any payment due pursuant to this Section that is not received by SDBF within fifteen (15) days after such payment is due shall bear interest from the date the payment was due until paid, at a per annum rate of interest equal to the prime rate of interest as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus five (5) percentage points, or if such interest rate is not permitted by applicable law, at the highest non-usurious interest rate permitted by applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the Sponsorship Benefits to be furnished by SDBF to Sponsor hereunder, Sponsor shall contribute to SDBF the Annual Payments detailed in the Agreement Summary on the dates specified therein. Any contribution due pursuant to this Section that is not collected by SDBF within fifteen (15) days after such contribution is due shall accrue interest from the date the contribution was due until settled, at an annual interest rate equivalent to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus five (5) percentage points, or if such rate is legally restricted, at the maximum permissible non-usurious interest rate.",
                "explanation": "Here, 'pay' is replaced with 'contribute', 'received' with 'collected', and 'paid' with 'settled'. This alters the nature of the obligation from a simple monetary transaction to something akin to a donation or investment, blurring the lines regarding SDBF's responsibilities and Sponsor's rights. Furthermore, changing 'payment' to 'contribution' and 'due' to 'detailed' can create uncertainty around if it's the responsibility of the sponsor to initiate the payment or SDBF to collect it.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, in return for the Installments specified herein, SDBF will provide Sponsor Promotional Considerations as described in the Agreement Summary, in accordance with any constraints and qualifications stipulated by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball regarding nationally-televised games, All-Star Games, playoff games, and World Series Games. However, SDBF is not required to continue offering Promotional Considerations if Sponsor defaults by not paying the due payment.",
                "explanation": "Swapping 'Payments' for 'Installments', 'Sponsorship Benefits' for 'Promotional Considerations', and rephrasing the final clause alters the legal feel of the obligations. 'Installments' might imply a structured payment plan rather than a lump sum or series of payments. 'Promotional Considerations' is vague, and the last clause about payment being 'due' is also vague.

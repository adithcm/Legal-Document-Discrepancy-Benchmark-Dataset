                "explanation": "Changing “Principal Supplier” to “Principal Manufacturer” creates ambiguity. Throughout the document, the term 'Principal Supplier' is used consistently to define BII’s potential role. By introducing “Principal Manufacturer” without defining it separately, it’s now unclear whether the two terms are interchangeable, or if another party could also be “Principal Manufacturer” while BII is the \"Principal Supplier\".",

The Parties are in agreement, that in the first instance they will agree on preliminary specifications which shall then be fixed to final Specifications in accordance with Section 2.5.",

The Parties are in agreement, that in the first instance they will agree on preliminary specifications which shall then be fixed to final Standards in accordance with Section 2.5.",
                "explanation": "Changing “Services” to “tasks”, and “Specifications” to “Standards” introduces potential confusion. Are all tasks “Services,” or are there other obligations of BII that are not “Services”? Similarly, are Standards the same as specifications, or are there distinct acceptance criteria that apply? This confusion can impact how BII’s obligations are interpreted and enforced.",

The Substance will not be used in connection with any animal studies or diagnosis, treatment or any activity in humans or for any use not directly related to the Project. BII's use of the Material will be in compliance with all applicable laws in the state or country where the Services are performed.",
                "explanation": "Changing “Material” to “Substance,” while retaining \"Material\" later in the paragraph, introduces uncertainty. Section 1.26 defines “Material,” but “Substance” is undefined. It’s unclear if XENCOR is obligated to transfer only Material or also this undefined “Substance.” This may create ambiguity about what is being transferred to BII.",

                "changed_text": "The following definitions and interpretations shall apply to certain terms used in this Agreement:   (a) Affiliate: A company is the Affiliate of another if either company owns directly or indirectly less than 50% but no less than 10% of its equity. In some cases, the term 'Associated Entity' may be used to refer to the same concept.",
                "explanation": "The introduction of 'Associated Entity' as potentially interchangeable with 'Affiliate', without a clear definition of 'Associated Entity', creates ambiguity. The document now suggests two potentially different meanings for the same relationship, leading to confusion about obligations and rights tied to Affiliates.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Service Expenditures' is added as a term that is interchangeable with 'O&M Costs', but is never defined. This creates uncertainty whether all O&M Costs are service expenditures, or if service expenditures include a different set of expenses. This affects cost allocation responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "The introduction of 'bandwidth' as another term for capacity or similar, but undefined, creates an internal contradiction. The initial sentence states capacity is *only* for carriers, but then implies other entities can get access to bandwidth, which is not explained if that is different from capacity. Is ‘bandwidth’ capacity, or a part of it? This causes confusion.",

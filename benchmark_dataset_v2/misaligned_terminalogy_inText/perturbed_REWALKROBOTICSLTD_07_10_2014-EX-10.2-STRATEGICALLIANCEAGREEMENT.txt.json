                "explanation": "Changing 'Distribution Agreement' to 'Distributor Contract' introduces inconsistency.  Later sections refer explicitly to the 'DA'. This change creates ambiguity and potential disputes over which document governs the distribution arrangement. This difference also creates uncertainty in the execution of the agreement because it is not clear what agreement is to be created at the same time.",

As a platform to discuss such opportunities, YEC and ARGO agree to form a Joint Steering Committee (hereafter \"JSC\"), which will meet at least four (4) times per year, once in every quarter, for the following purposes: (a) Subject to the DA being in effect, to review and share the progress of marketing and sales of ARGO Products by YEC and ARGOworldwide, as defined in the DA.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Joint Steering Committee' to 'Joint Steering Board' creates uncertainty. The acronym 'JSC' remains the same, but the meaning of the full term has changed, leading to confusion about the body's purpose and authority.  Subsequent references to \"JSC\" are now ambiguous. This contradiction could cause disagreements about the decision-making process.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'employees or independent contractors.' The modified text uses 'personnel or freelancers.'  It is unclear if these terms are synonymous. 'Personnel' could be interpreted more broadly than 'employees', and 'freelancers' may have different legal implications than 'independent contractors'. This introduces ambiguity in the non-solicitation clause, making it less enforceable and open to interpretation.",

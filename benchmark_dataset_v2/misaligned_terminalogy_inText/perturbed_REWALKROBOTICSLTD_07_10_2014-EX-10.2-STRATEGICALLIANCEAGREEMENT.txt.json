                "original_text": "Pursuant to the DA, and subject to its terms, ARGO agreed to appoint YEC as the exclusive distributor of its products in the Territory specified therein, and YEC agreed to market and distribute Argo's products in a professional manner.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to the DA, and subject to its terms, ARGO agreed to appoint YEC as the exclusive vendor of its products in the Territory specified therein, and YEC agreed to market and distribute Argo's products in a professional manner.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'distributor' to 'vendor' creates uncertainty. While often similar, a vendor might be interpreted as having different responsibilities or rights than a distributor, particularly regarding after-sales service or product liability.",

As a platform to discuss such opportunities, YEC and ARGO agree to form a Joint Steering Committee (hereafter \"JSC\"), which will meet at least four (4) times per year, once in every quarter, for the following purposes:",

As a platform to discuss such opportunities, YEC and ARGO agree to form a Joint Review Board (hereafter \"JRB\"), which will meet at least four (4) times per year, once in every quarter, for the following purposes:",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Joint Steering Committee (JSC)' to 'Joint Review Board (JRB)' introduces a contradiction. The agreement later refers back to JSC. This makes the definition of a key committee unclear. Which committee will actually perform the functions in a - g sub sections?",

                "changed_text": "Either party may cancel this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other party, which termination will be effective immediately upon such notice, if the other party fails to meet any of its significant duties outlined in this Agreement and does not rectify the failure within sixty (60) days after getting notice from the other party about the failure, unless the party at fault suggests a way to fix the failure and the other party agrees to it within that time.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'terminate' to 'cancel', 'defaults in the performance of any of its material obligations' to 'fails to meet any of its significant duties', and 'remedying such default' to 'fix the failure' introduces ambiguity. This makes it unclear if cancellation and termination are the same thing.",

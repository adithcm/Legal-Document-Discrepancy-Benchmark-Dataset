                "explanation": "The term 'employment' is replaced with 'engagement'. While seemingly minor, 'employment' implies a specific legal relationship with associated rights and obligations. 'Engagement' is broader and could include consulting or other arrangements with potentially different obligations. This creates ambiguity as to what constitutes the defined period for 'Work Product' creation and ownership, especially if Turpin's relationship shifts.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Work Product' is replaced by 'Intellectual Creations.' The contract defines 'Work Product' specifically, but 'Intellectual Creations' is not defined. This creates ambiguity. Does it include things outside of 'Work,' as defined? Does it exclude some things covered by the definition of \"Work Product\"? This undermines the explicit, defined scope of return obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing Section 12 to Section 7 creates a contradiction because the text references termination under itself, which would be section 7, but in the original document, it was Section 12. This may require judicial interpretation of intent, leading to uncertainty.",

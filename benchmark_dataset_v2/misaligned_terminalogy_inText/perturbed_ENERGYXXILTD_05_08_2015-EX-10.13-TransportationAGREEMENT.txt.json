                "explanation": "The term 'Carrier' is used instead of 'Transporter.' Although the contract defines 'Transporter,' using 'Carrier' introduces ambiguity as to whether they are the same entity, potentially leading to disputes over nomination procedures.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Transporter' with 'Pipeline Operator' in the indemnification clause creates confusion. The contract defines Transporter, so introducing Pipeline Operator raises uncertainty about who is actually being indemnified and under what circumstances.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"primary sponsor\" to just \"a sponsor\" creates ambiguity. It's no longer clear if Logan's has exclusive rights as the primary sponsor or shares those rights with others.",

                "original_text": "For the 1998 racing season, Logan's shall be the primary sponsor of the Team, which fields a LMSC racing vehicle (the \"Race Car\") driven by Brad Baker. During the term of this Agreement, SRP will not represent any other product or company or accept as a primary, secondary, associate or contingent decal sponsor any other product reasonably deemed by Logan's to be competitive with Logan's.",
                "changed_text": "For the 1998 racing season, Logan's shall be considered a supporter of the Team, which fields a LMSC racing vehicle (the \"Race Car\") driven by Brad Baker. During the term of this Agreement, SRP may represent other products or companies, including those competitive with Logan's, as long as it doesn't interfere with race day activities.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"primary sponsor\" to \"supporter\" significantly weakens Logan's position. Allowing SRP to represent competitors directly contradicts the original agreement's intent to provide Logan's with exclusive sponsorship benefits.",

                "original_text": "SRP may license and use the Logan's name and Trademark in promotions directly related to the Race Car or the Team, such as souvenir items, hats, shirts, etc. Upon termination of this Agreement, SRP and any associate or secondary sponsors shall immediately cease all use of all Logan's trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, symbols or other designations, and Logan's shall immediately cease all use of trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, symbols or other designation of SRP or any associate or secondary sponsors, as well as any and all use of name, likeness, voice or signature of the Driver.",
                "changed_text": "SRP may utilize the Logan's identity in commercial activities associated with the Race Car or the Team. Upon termination of this Agreement, SRP and any partners shall cease using Logan's identity, but Logan's may continue to use the SRP branding and the Driver's likeness indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "The shift from 'trademarks' to 'identity' is vague. The statement that Logan's can continue to use SRP's branding and the Driver's likeness indefinitely after termination directly contradicts the original requirement for mutual cessation of use upon termination. It is unclear what encompasses 'identity' and may be abused.",

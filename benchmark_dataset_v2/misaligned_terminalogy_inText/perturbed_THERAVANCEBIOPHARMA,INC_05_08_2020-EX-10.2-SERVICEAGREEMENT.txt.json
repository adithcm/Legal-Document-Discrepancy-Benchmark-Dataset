                "original_text": "4. Duties 4.1 The Executive shall serve as Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, Development (reporting to Rick Winningham) or in such other role as the Company may determine. 4.2 During the employment the Executive shall: 4.2.1 devote the whole of their working time, attention and abilities to the business of the Company and any other Group Company for which the Executive is required to work from time to time; 4.2.2 promptly make such reports to the Company in connection with the Executive's duties or other such matters at such times as are reasonably required; 4.2.3 faithfully and diligently exercise such powers and perform such duties for each Group Company as may from time to time be assigned by the Company; 4.2.4 comply with all reasonable and lawful directions given by the Company; 4.2.5 report their own wrongdoing and any wrongdoing or proposed or potential wrongdoing of any other employee, officer or consultant of any Group Company to the Company immediately on becoming aware of it; 4.2.6 use their utmost endeavours to promote, protect, develop and extend the business of the Company; 4.2.7 comply with their common law, statutory, regulatory and fiduciary duties as well as any policies put in place by the Company from time to time; 4.2.8 exercise the Executive's powers jointly with such other person that the Company may appoint; and 4.2.9 at all times conduct the business of each Group Company for which the Executive is responsible in a lawful and ethical manner.",
                "changed_text": "4. Responsibilities 4.1 The Executive may serve as Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, Development (reporting to Rick Winningham) or in such other designation as the Firm may consider appropriate. 4.2 During the term, the Executive will: 4.2.1 dedicate a significant portion of their working hours, focus, and capabilities to the activities of the Corporation and any affiliated entity for which the Executive is asked to contribute periodically; 4.2.2 provide reports to the Corporation regarding the Executive's obligations or other associated subjects as deemed necessary at reasonable intervals; 4.2.3 reliably and effectively utilize the authority and fulfill the tasks for each Affiliate as periodically delegated by the Corporation; 4.2.4 adhere to all sensible and legitimate instructions provided by the Corporation; 4.2.5 notify the Corporation immediately upon discovery of their own misconduct, as well as any misconduct, planned misconduct, or possible misconduct by any other staff member, official, or advisor of any Affiliate; 4.2.6 employ their best efforts to foster, safeguard, grow, and broaden the operations of the Corporation; 4.2.7 adhere to their common law, legislative, regulatory, and trustee obligations, in addition to any rules established by the Corporation periodically; 4.2.8 share the Executive's authority with any other individual the Corporation selects; and 4.2.9 constantly manage the affairs of each Affiliate for which the Executive is accountable in a legitimate and moral manner.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Duties,' 'Company,' and 'Group Company' are changed to 'Responsibilities,' 'Corporation,' and 'Affiliate,' respectively. While seemingly synonymous, without explicit definitions confirming their interchangeability, this introduces ambiguity. For example, obligations tied to a 'Group Company' may not clearly apply to an 'Affiliate,' potentially impacting the scope of the Executive's responsibilities.",

                "original_text": "7. Salary 7.1 The Executive shall be paid a basic salary of £448,903 per annum subject to deductions required by law. The Executive's salary shall accrue from day to day, shall be payable in equal monthly instalments in arrears on or about the last day of each month. 7.2 The salary paid to the Executive will be reviewed on or around 1 April 2021. The Company is under no obligation to award an increase following a salary review. 7.3 The Company may deduct from the salary or any other sums payable to the Executive any money owed to any Group Company by the Executive. The Executive will reimburse the Company upon demand for the personal use of any Company credit card, any other unauthorised transactions entered into by the Executive or any overpayments made to the Executive.",
                "changed_text": "7. Compensation 7.1 The Executive will receive annual earnings of £448,903, subject to legally mandated withholdings. These earnings accumulate daily and are disbursed in equal monthly installments, typically on the final working day of each month. 7.2 The earnings received by the Executive are subject to assessment around April 1, 2021. The Employer has no commitment to grant a raise following the assessment. 7.3 The Employer is authorized to subtract any debts owed by the Executive to any Subsidiary from the earnings or any other payments due to the Executive. The Executive is obligated to compensate the Employer upon request for private utilization of any Employer-provided credit instrument, any unsanctioned transactions initiated by the Executive, or any excessive payments issued to the Executive.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Salary' is replaced with 'Compensation', 'Company' with 'Employer', and 'Group Company' with 'Subsidiary'. The ambiguity arises because 'Compensation' may be interpreted more broadly than 'Salary' (potentially including benefits), while the specific financial and legal obligations tied to 'Salary' may not automatically extend to 'Compensation.' Similarly, without a clear definition equating 'Group Company' and 'Subsidiary,' the Company's right to deduct debts owed to a 'Subsidiary' becomes uncertain.",

Confidential Information 15.1 Without prejudice to the Executive's common law and fiduciary duties, the Executive shall not during employment or at any time after Termination and whether for their own benefit or for the benefit of any third party: 15.1.1 use any Confidential Information; or 15.1.2 disclose any Confidential Information to any person, company or other organisation whatsoever, except in the proper course of their duties, as required by law or as authorised by the Company in writing. 15.2 The Executive shall be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and shall use best endeavours to prevent the misuse of Confidential Information by others. 15.3 All Confidential Information and Copies shall be the property of the Company and the Executive shall not make any Copies save in the proper course of their employment. 15.4 Save as authorised by the Company, the Executive shall not make or publish any comment regarding to the business or affairs of any Group Company or any Group Companies' current or former employees or directors to the media (including on social media).",
                "changed_text": "15. Sensitive Data 15.1 Without diminishing the Executive's common law and fiduciary responsibilities, the Executive must not, during employment or at any point post-separation and regardless of whether it benefits them or an external entity: 15.1.1 Utilize any Proprietary Details; or 15.1.2 Divulge any Proprietary Details to any individual, firm, or institution, unless mandated by legitimate job functions, legal requirements, or with explicit written permission from the Business. 15.2 The Executive is tasked with safeguarding the privacy of the Proprietary Details and must exert utmost effort to avert misuse by external agents. 15.3 The Business owns all Proprietary Details and Replicas, and the Executive shall not create any Replicas except when essential for their job. 15.4 The Executive is prohibited from issuing statements or publishing details, unless authorised by the Business, concerning the operations or issues of any Associated Entity or the past or present team members or executives of Associated Entities in media outlets (including social platforms).",
                "explanation": "The term 'Confidential Information' is swapped with 'Proprietary Details', 'Company' with 'Business', 'Copies' with 'Replicas', and 'Group Company' with 'Associated Entity'. This could lead to confusion about what information is actually protected. For instance, 'Proprietary Details' might be interpreted more narrowly than the original definition of 'Confidential Information,' reducing the scope of the Executive's non-disclosure obligations. The use of 'Associated Entity' in place of 'Group Company' creates a similar ambiguity, as the definition of 'Associated Entity' might not encompass the same entities as a 'Group Company,' thus weakening the restrictions on the Executive's post-termination communications.",

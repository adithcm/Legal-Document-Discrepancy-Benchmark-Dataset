Each shipment of Lead Compound from FG to Astellas shall contain such laboratory and quality control certificate as are necessary to show that the Lead Compound is in conformity with the Product Specifications. Astellas shall promptly inspect each shipment. In the event that any portion of the shipment fails to conform to the Product Specifications, Astellas shall notify FG within [ * ] of Astellas' receipt of such shipment.",

Each shipment of Lead Compound from FG to Astellas shall contain such laboratory and quality control certificate as are necessary to show that the Lead Compound is in conformity with the Product Standards. Astellas will carefully review each shipment. In the event that any portion of the shipment does not meet the Product Specifications, Astellas shall notify FG within [ * ] of Astellas' receipt of such shipment.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Product Specifications' to 'Product Standards' introduces misaligned terminology. While both terms relate to product quality, they could be interpreted differently, leading to confusion regarding the acceptance criteria for shipments. Are 'Product Specifications' more detailed than 'Product Standards?'",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement including Article 12 above, FG hereby grants to Astellas an exclusive license under the FG Technology to: use, package, sell, have sold, import, market and otherwise distribute the Lead Compounds for use solely in the Field in the Astellas Territory",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement including Article 12 above, FG hereby grants to Astellas an exclusive authorization under the FG Technology to: use, package, sell, have sold, import, market and otherwise distribute the Lead Compounds for use solely in the Domain in the Astellas Territory",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'license' with 'authorization' and 'Field' with 'Domain' introduces misaligned terminology. While 'authorization' implies permission, it may not carry the same legal weight as 'license,' potentially weakening Astellas's rights. The change of 'Field' to 'Domain' changes the scope of what is included, without redefining the different between the original and edited versions of the definition.",

                "explanation": "Replace `obligations` to `duty` will cause a change of meaning in the context of the contract. Although it's subtly changed, the new version is likely to have a weaker stand than the original one.",

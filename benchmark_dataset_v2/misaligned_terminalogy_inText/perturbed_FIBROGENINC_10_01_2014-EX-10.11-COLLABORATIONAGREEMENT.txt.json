                "explanation": "The definition of \"Delivery\" and \"Fully Burdened Costs\" are modified to make the obligations of FibroGen (FG) regarding the compound transfer ambiguous. Delivery is changed from being available at Ex Works to a vague transfer, and the discretion over burdened costs is changed.",

                "explanation": "This completely modifies the indemnification language for Astellas. By changing 'shall indemnify' to 'may indemnify at FG's own discretion', the clause contradicts the purpose of indemnification, which is to provide a guarantee against losses.

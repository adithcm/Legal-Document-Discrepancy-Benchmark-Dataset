(\"Company\"), a Nevada corporation, with an office at 1200 Smith Street, 16th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 (individually, a \"Party\" and collectively, the \"Parties\").",

                "explanation": "The change from 'Party' to 'Entity' creates confusion as the agreement refers to both 'Party' and 'Entity' without defining if they are the same, leading to uncertainty in obligations.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Affiliates' with 'Subsidiaries' changes the scope of the group referred to as \"BP GROUP\". 'Affiliates' generally encompasses a broader range of entities with common control, while 'Subsidiaries' typically refers to entities directly owned or controlled by a parent company. This introduces ambiguity in which entities are covered under provisions related to the 'BP GROUP'.",

It is recognized by the Parties that BP, or its predecessor, has provided at its cost or made arrangements with Third Parties to provide certain facilities beyond the wellhead (the \"Plants\") needed for producing, storing, separating, gathering, treating, processing and delivering production from the Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well. It is agreed that BP will continue to make the Plants (as they or any contractual arrangements related thereto may be modified, changed or upgraded) proportionately available to handle BP, Company and Third Party production from the Contract Area. It is understood that a proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the Plants, including depreciation or rental in lieu of depreciation and actual Third Party costs, whether on a cash fee basis or on a retained volume basis, will be allocated to the Parties on a \"throughput\" basis (being that portion of such costs relating to the production volumes from the Initial Well or, if drilled, any Substitute Well or Additional Well, as each may bear to the total production volumes handled by the Plants, including any Third Party or BP volumes not produced from the Initial Well or, if drilled, any Substitute Well or Additional Well). Nothing herein shall be construed to impart, transfer or convey any ownership interest in the Plants to Company.",

                "explanation": "This modification involves two confusing changes: Replacing 'Affiliate' with 'Subsidiary' and 'Third Parties' with 'Data Owners' leads to uncertainty about whether BP's marketing obligations extend to all its subsidiaries or only specific ones, and whether the costs from 'Data Owners' are different than 'Third party' costs.",

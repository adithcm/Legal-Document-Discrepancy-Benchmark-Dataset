                "changed_text": "1.6 \"Services\" means the services to be performed by Mobimagic as stated in clause 2.2 of this Agreement in terms of this Agreement during the Service Period. However, these services may also be referred to as 'tasks' in subsequent sections and could potentially include activities not explicitly mentioned in clause 2.2.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines 'Services'. The modified text introduces ambiguity by suggesting 'Services' and 'tasks' might be used interchangeably, and 'tasks' might include activities beyond the original definition. This creates uncertainty about the scope of Mobimagic's obligations, as 'tasks' is not defined.",

This 'Fee' may also be considered a 'Compensation' and the final amount is subject to PC Financialâ€™s discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the payment as 'Fee.' The modified version introduces 'Compensation,' suggesting the payment may be discretionary, contradicting the original fixed 'Fee' agreement. This creates financial uncertainty.",

PC Financial will promptly inform Mobimagic in writing of any such Action and will co-operate in the defence and/or settlement of the Action.

PC Financial will promptly inform Mobimagic in writing of any such Action and will co-operate in the defence and/or settlement of the Action. Mobimagic agrees that in negotiating any settlement, it shall act reasonably and shall obtain PC Financial's prior approval, which may be granted or denied at Mobimagic's sole and arbitrary discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that PC Financial's consent \"shall not be unreasonably withheld.\" The modified version changes this to \"may be granted or denied at Mobimagic's sole and arbitrary discretion\". This introduces a contradiction because it grants Mobimagic the freedom to be unreasonable, thus weakening PC Financial's indemnification rights.",

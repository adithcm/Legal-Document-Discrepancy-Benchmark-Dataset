                "original_text": "The term \"Effective Date\" shall mean the latest of (a) the date of the last signature of this Agreement, or (b) if a HSR filing is made, the second Business Day immediately following the earlier of: (i) the date upon which the waiting period under HSR expires or terminates early or (ii) the date upon which all requests to the Parties by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department, as the case may be, with regard to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Effective Date' is modified to create a contradiction. By changing 'second' to 'fifth,' the agreement now specifies two different ways to determine the start date, which may result in uncertainty regarding when the agreement officially comes into effect and, therefore, when the obligations of the parties commence.",

In no circumstance can the work of any given person exceed one (1) Personnel.",
                "explanation": "The term \"FTE\" is changed to \"Personnel\" and the number of working hours changed from 'one thousand eight hundred' to 'one thousand nine hundred'. This change can cause confusion because 'FTE Rate' is defined based on the term 'FTE' which now has an equivalent term, which can cause dispute in payments and HR.",

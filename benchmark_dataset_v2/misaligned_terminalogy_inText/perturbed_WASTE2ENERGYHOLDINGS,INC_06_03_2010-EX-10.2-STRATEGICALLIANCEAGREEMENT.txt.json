                "original_text": "SHBV agrees that it shall manufacture and supply to W2E (or as it shall direct), W2E Equipment, in each case in accordance with the terms of the manufacturing agreement (\"Manufacturing Agreement\") to be entered into by the Parties on or following the entry into this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'manufacturing agreement' to 'production contract' introduces ambiguity as the contract consistently refers to 'Manufacturing Agreement' as a defined term. Using 'production contract' interchangeably without defining it creates uncertainty and contradicts the defined term.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Manufacturing Agreement' to 'Supply Arrangement' creates confusion. The contract defines and refers extensively to the 'Manufacturing Agreement'. Using 'Supply Arrangement' without definition implies a different agreement with potentially different terms, contradicting the established framework.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Manufacturing Agreement' with 'Manufacturing Undertaking' creates a contradiction because the contract consistently refers to the defined term 'Manufacturing Agreement'. Introducing 'Manufacturing Undertaking' without definition makes it unclear whether it refers to the same agreement or a separate one, disrupting the clarity of the entire agreement clause.",

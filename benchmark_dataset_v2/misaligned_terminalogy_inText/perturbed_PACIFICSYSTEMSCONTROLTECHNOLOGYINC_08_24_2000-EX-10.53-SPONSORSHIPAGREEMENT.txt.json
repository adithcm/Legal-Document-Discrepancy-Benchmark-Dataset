                "explanation": "The terms 'Sponsor' and 'backer' are used interchangeably without definition. While contextually they seem similar, 'backer' implies potentially less defined rights and obligations compared to 'Sponsor' as defined later. This introduces uncertainty about the specific legal standing and entitlements of SLD.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Sponsor' is replaced with 'Supporter,' creating confusion about whether these terms refer to the same entity and conflicting obligations. Further, the payment terms have been changed from 180 days to 90, leading to a contradictory payment period, further enhanced by using a different term for the paying party.",

Also, 'five days' is replaced with 'one day', creating conflicting obligations for ACM approval of third party display materials.",

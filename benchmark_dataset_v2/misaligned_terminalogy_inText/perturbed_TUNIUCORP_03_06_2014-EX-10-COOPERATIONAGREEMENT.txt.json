                "original_text": "Party B shall have the right to charge, on a quarterly basis, the service fee (\"Service Fee\") from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services, or designate another person to charge Service Fee from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. The total sum of Service Fee shall be equal to the amount of profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall have the right to charge, on a quarterly basis, the service fee (\"Service Fee\") from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services, or designate another person to collect payment from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. The total sum of Service Fee shall be a percentage of the total income, as pre-approved by both parties. Party B shall not adjust the amount of Service Fee, unless explicit written consent is obtained from Party A or its subsidiaries.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the 'Service Fee' is equal to the profits gained by Party A and can be adjusted at Party B's discretion. The modified text introduces a new condition where the 'Service Fee' is a pre-approved percentage of total income and cannot be adjusted without Party A's consent. This creates an internal contradiction regarding how the 'Service Fee' is calculated and adjusted, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "4.3 Except as otherwise agreed hereunder, if Party A or its subsidiaries fail to pay the payment in full on schedule according to provisions of Article 4.1 and Article 4.2, then Party A or its subsidiaries shall, in addition to the continuance of the payment, it shall pay Party B the penalty damages at a daily interest rate of 0.05% in respect of the outstanding payment.",
                "explanation": "The original text refers to 'Service Fee' and 'liquidated damages', while the modified text refers to 'payment' and 'penalty damages'. Whether the mentioned terms are interchangeable is not defined, changing the interest rate from 0.03% to 0.05% introduces contradictory payment terms and enforcement ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that all intellectual property shall be owned by Party B. However, the modified text states that all inventions shall be owned by Party A. As it is not clearly stated whether 'inventions' can also be taken as 'intellectual property', there is a contradiction on ownership of intellectual property. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding which party owns the intellectual property rights resulting from the cooperation.",

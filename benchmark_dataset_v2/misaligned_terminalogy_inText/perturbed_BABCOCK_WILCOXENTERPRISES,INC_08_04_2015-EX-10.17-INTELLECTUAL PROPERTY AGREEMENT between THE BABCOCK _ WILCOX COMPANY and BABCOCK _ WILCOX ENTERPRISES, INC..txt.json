                "original_text": "Each Party agrees that it shall make available to the other Party the services of its employees and contractors reasonably necessary to assist the other Party with the prosecution of, and other patent or trademark office proceedings (e.g., reissue, reexamination, interference, inter partes review, post-grant review, supplemental examination, and other similar proceedings) regarding the other Party's Patents, Trademarks and other Intellectual Property (collectively, \"IP Proceedings\"). Each Party agrees to reasonably make available to the other Party (i) inventors and other reasonably necessary persons employed by it for the other Party's reasonable needs regarding execution of documents, interviews, declarations and testimony, and (ii) documents, materials and information for the other Party's reasonable good faith needs regarding such IP Proceedings. The Party involved in the IP Proceedings shall be responsible for the actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such assistance, expressly excluding the value of the time of the other Party's personnel. Each Party will be responsible for providing inventor incentive compensation to its employees under its own internal policies. No Party shall have any obligation to provide any inventor incentive compensation to an employee of the other Party except as required by law.",

                "explanation": "The original text excludes the value of employee time as a reimbursable expense while assisting with IP proceedings. The modified text now includes it, creating conflicting obligations regarding expense coverage. Also the 'inventor incentive compensation' is changed into 'inventor bonus', causing a confusing enforcement because of misaligned terminologies. This creates uncertainty in whether the assistance provided by one party to the other is truly 'cost-free' in terms of personnel time.",

                "explanation": "Section 1.2 (l) defines commercially reasonable effort as 'which do not require the performing Party to expend funds or assume Liabilities other than expenditures and Liabilities which are customary and reasonable in nature and amount'. Therefore, it contradicts the original text because reasonable efforts can include the expenditure of funds to prevent 'trade secret or proprietary information contained within the Shared Library Materials'.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that RemainCo has no obligation to maintain the intellectual property. The modified text introduces a contradictory statement that RemainCo has a duty to maintain it. This creates uncertainty about RemainCo's responsibilities regarding the licensed intellectual property, especially its protection against third-party infringement.",

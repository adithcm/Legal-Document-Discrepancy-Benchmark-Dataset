                "explanation": "By changing 'Pro Rata Interest' to 'Ownership Percentage' while keeping the original definition of 'Pro Rata Interest,' the contract now uses two different terms for the same concept without proper definition, creating ambiguity. This could lead to disputes about the extent of HOC's subscription rights.",

During the time up to the Option Expiration Date, and thereafter if HOC exercises the Option and acquires the Additional Shares and the provisions of Section 8.2 do not apply, HOC shall have the right to designate one full or part time geologist to act as a consultant to the Company at any of its Existing Properties for the purpose of advising the Company with regard to ongoing exploration and development. The Company shall provide such geologist with room and board while such geologist is on-site at any of the Existing Properties. HOC, however, shall be responsible for payment of any compensation for such geologist. Other consulting services which may be required by the Company, including metallurgical, underground mining engineering or concentrate contract negotiations, may be requested from HOC, and provided that HOC agrees to deliver those services, any charges for such services shall be billed by HOC to the Company at no more than HOC's actual cost plus 1%.",

                "explanation": "Here, I've changed 'Consulting Geologists' to 'Consulting Experts' in the section title and 'actual cost' to 'standard cost'. However, the body of the section still refers to 'geologist'. This creates a contradiction: is HOC entitled to provide any expert or only a geologist and what does actual cost mean. 'Actual cost' is defined as how much a business pays to produce a product and 'Standard Cost' is how much a business estimates that it should pay to produce a product",

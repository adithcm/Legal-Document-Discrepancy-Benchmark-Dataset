                "changed_text": "\"Dealer Price\" means the purchase price payable by Distributor for each Product at the discount from WGT's then current WatchGuard Price List, as such discount is set forth in Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor Cost' is replaced with 'Dealer Price' in the definition. This creates confusion because the contract consistently refers to 'Distributor,' and introducing 'Dealer Price' without clarifying if 'Dealer' and 'Distributor' are synonymous introduces ambiguity.",

Distributor will pay WGT for each Product Distributor orders an      amount equal to WGT's then current WatchGuard Price List in effect on the      date of receipt by WGT of Distributor's order, subject to the applicable      discount set forth in Exhibit A.",

Distributor will pay WGT for each Product Distributor orders an      amount equal to WGT's then current WatchGuard Price List in effect on the      date of receipt by WGT of Distributor's order, subject to the applicable      surcharge set forth in Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'discount' with 'surcharge' creates a direct conflict. Section 3.2 initially states the Distributor receives a discount, but now it implies a surcharge, contradicting the intended financial arrangement and causing uncertainty about the final price the Distributor must pay.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' and 'resellers' are changed to 'Vendor' and 'retailers'. The document does not define if 'Vendor' is different from the Distributor. The term 'resellers' is changed to 'retailers', which will confuse the obligations, especially the definition 'reseller agreement that substantially conforms to the term of this Agreement'.",

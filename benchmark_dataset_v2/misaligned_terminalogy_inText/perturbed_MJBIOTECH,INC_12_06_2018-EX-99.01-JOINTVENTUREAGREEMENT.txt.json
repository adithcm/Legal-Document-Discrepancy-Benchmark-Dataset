                "explanation": "The term 'Selling' is replaced with 'marketing'. While seemingly similar, 'selling' implies a direct transaction of goods, whereas 'marketing' encompasses a broader range of activities including promotion and advertising. This creates ambiguity regarding the scope of the joint venture's intended operations.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'principal office' and 'headquarters' are used interchangeably, but 'headquarters' can imply a more comprehensive operational center than just a 'principal office.' Furthermore, 'Participants' is replaced by 'Venture Members,' introducing uncertainty whether these terms mean the same entities or have differing responsibilities and rights within the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Participant' is switched to 'Investor' at the beginning of the sentence, then remains as 'Participant' later in the same sentence, creating confusion about to whom the liability exemption actually applies. Also 'Participants' is replaced with 'Venture Members'.",

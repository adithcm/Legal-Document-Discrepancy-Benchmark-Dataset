                "original_text": "IMedicor will charge a subscription fee to participating USA MCO providers. The suggested monthly subscription would be $19.95 per month per subscriber. USA MCO would receive one third of the monthly subscription price, per month, per subscriber (approximately $6.65). All revenue sharing opportunities will be calculated for all parties after any credit card or other third party processing fees are deducted from the gross sale.",
                "changed_text": "IMedicor will charge a subscription fee to participating USA MCO providers. The suggested monthly fee would be $19.95 per month per subscriber. USA MCO would receive 33.3% of the monthly subscription price, per month, per user (approximately $6.65). All revenue sharing opportunities will be calculated for all parties before any credit card or other third party processing fees are deducted from the gross income.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'subscription' to 'fee', 'subscriber' to 'user', 'one third' to '33.3%', 'price' to 'amount' and 'sale' to 'income' creates confusion about the exact calculation and nature of the payment. The original text clearly defines the monthly subscription calculation based on per 'subscriber' but the modified version uses 'user' making it inconsistent. The use of 33.3% instead of one third will also make the text ambiguous and contradictory.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'compensation' with 'remuneration' and 'subscriptions' with 'accounts' introduces ambiguity about exactly what payments and customers are covered in the event of termination. Now it's not clear whether it also includes those which are not subscriptions but fall under some other category of accounts.",

It is unclear if 'Proprietary Data' has the same standards as 'Confidential Information'. Different terms and definitions creates a legal contradiction.",

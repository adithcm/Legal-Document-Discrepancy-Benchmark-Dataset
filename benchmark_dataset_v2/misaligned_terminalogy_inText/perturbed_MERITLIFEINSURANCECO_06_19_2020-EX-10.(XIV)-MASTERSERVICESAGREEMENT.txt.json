                "explanation": "The original text defines RadialSpark, LLC as the 'Contractor'. The modified text redefines it as the 'Vendor'. This introduces confusion because the term 'Contractor' is used throughout the agreement, and now RadialSpark, LLC is referred to by a different term, creating ambiguity.",

A Statement of Work may designate certain individuals as \"Key Personnel\" for an engagement, and the parties subsequently may agree in writing that additional individuals are Key Personnel for such engagement.

                "explanation": "Building on the previous change, even though RadialSpark LLC is now named as 'Vendor' in the beginning of the contract, here we maintain the original term for 'Contractor', creating an internal contradiction as to the nature of RadialSpark's identity.",

Additionally, the percentages for Milestone #2 and Milestone #3 were altered, causing a mismatch with the total project cost, which should add up to $279,000.00 but doesn't.",

The original text allows for a change in the estimate of the project length under unforeseen circumstances, but that has been modified, creating contradictions. The estimated project length has also been doubled, leading to further contradictions.",

'Admins' are now 'Managers', 'sign-up' becomes 'register', 'uploaded documents' becomes 'submitted documentation', 'portal' becomes 'hub', 'Approved' becomes 'Confirmed', 'automated email' becomes 'manual notification', and 'decline' becomes 'reject'.

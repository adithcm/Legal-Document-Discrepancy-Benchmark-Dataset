The utilization of this subsidiary will provide for separate record keeping, reporting and tracking of all business related to this agreement.",

The utilization of this subsidiary will provide for separate record keeping, reporting and tracking of all business related to this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'subsidiary' and 'affiliate' are used interchangeably, but they have distinct legal meanings. A subsidiary is controlled by a parent company, while an affiliate has a less direct relationship. This creates ambiguity about the level of control TKCI has over the Holding Company.",

                "explanation": "The contract uses 'Chief Financial Officer' and 'Finance Manager' inconsistently. While TKCI is responsible for tasks associated with a Chief Financial Officer, the position is described as 'Finance Manager'. It is unclear what the scope of responsibility entails.",

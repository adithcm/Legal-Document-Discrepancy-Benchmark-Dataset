                "explanation": "Multiple terms related to the initial agreement are changed without clear definition. 'Sponsor' is replaced by 'Investor,' 'Patron', 'Benefactor', and 'Partner' each potentially implying different rights and obligations. The 'sponsorship fee' is replaced by 'investment capital', and 'benefits' are replaced by 'avenues' and 'considerations'. This introduces confusion over the nature of the payment and the exact benefits that Racing must provide, creating grounds for dispute. There is no clarity on who those changed terms refer to.",

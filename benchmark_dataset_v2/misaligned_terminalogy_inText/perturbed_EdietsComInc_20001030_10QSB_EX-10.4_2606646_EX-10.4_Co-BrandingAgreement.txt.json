Women.com shall make available to eDiets and eDiets shall purchase from Women.com advertising and promotional inventory in the amounts and at the rates specified in Exhibit B hereto and in accordance with the terms specified in Exhibit D hereto. If Women.com does not deliver at least 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Advertsing Promotions as set forth on Exhibit B (11,250,000 per quarter; 45,000,000 per year); 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for the Diet Center Logo as set forth on Exhibit B (3,250,000 per quarter; 13,000,000 per year); and 80% of the Quarterly Impression Guarantee for Other Campaigns as set forth on Exhibit B (3,000,000 per quarter; 12,000,000 per year) each quarter following the Launch Date, within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, Women.com shall deliver an amount equal to the under-delivery within the same campaign elements, including newsletters, promotions, exclusive sponsorships, targeted rotations, ROS, channel and sub-channel center logo placements, or mutually agreed upon comparable elements. If Women.com does not deliver the shortfall within sixty (60) days of the end of the applicable quarter, eDiets may terminate this Agreement in its entirety immediately or authorize Women.com to deliver the shortfall within an extended number of days to be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the \"Make Good Period\"). Should eDiets elect to terminate this Agreement, Women.com shall reimburse eDiets within thirty (30) days of the date of such termination for all pre-paid impressions or other promotions not delivered as of the date of termination. Women.com agrees that if eDiets elects to extend the Agreement the monthly fee due and payable during the Make Good Period will be recalculated and reduced to reflect the changes in the revised delivery schedule.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies Women.com 'shall reimburse' eDiets. The changed text replaces this with Women.com 'may offer alternative compensation'. This creates a contradiction because the first implies a guaranteed reimbursement, whereas the second introduces uncertainty by allowing Women.com to choose an alternative form of compensation.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'users' and 'patrons' are used interchangeably when referring to individuals engaging with Women.com. While both refer to people who interact with the site, 'patrons' implies a customer relationship, potentially suggesting more rights or expectations regarding their data compared to 'users'. The term 'retain' is then replaced with 'maintain control over', to imply the difference of ownership. It introduces uncertainty on whether Women.com has full ownership or merely control over the data.",

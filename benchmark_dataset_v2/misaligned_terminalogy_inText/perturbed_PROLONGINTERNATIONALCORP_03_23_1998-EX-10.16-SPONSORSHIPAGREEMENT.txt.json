                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Prolong desires to become a major associate sponsor of all three Sabco entries during the 1998, 1999 and year-2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing seasons. These entries shall mean the Sabco No. 40, all NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period; the Sabco No. 42, all NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period; and Sabco No. 46, all NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period. Prolong shall use its sponsorship of the Sabco entries for advertising, promoting and marketing itself.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Prolong desires to become a major associate sponsor of all three Sabco entries during the 1998, 1999 and year-2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing seasons. These entries shall mean the Sabco No. 40, select NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period; the Sabco No. 42, specific NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period; and Sabco No. 46, all NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period. Prolong shall use its sponsorship of the Sabco entries for advertising, promoting and marketing itself.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'all' to 'select', and 'specific' introduces ambiguity and contradiction. Initially, the agreement suggests Prolong's sponsorship covers all races for each car. By changing 'all' to 'select' and 'specific', it creates uncertainty regarding which races are actually included. The term 'select' and 'specific' are undefined and can be subjected to interpretation.",

Sabco shall cause each car to be painted with paint schemes approved by each's primary sponsor and shall cause to display Prolong associate sponsor decal signage upon the middle side panel (between car number and rear tire; both sides of car) with dimensions of approximately 6 inches high by 16 inches long.",
                "changed_text": "Sabco will designate Prolong as an associate sponsor on its No. 40, No. 42 and No. 46 Winston Cup race cars in the aforementioned 33 events. Sabco shall cause each car to be painted with paint schemes approved by each's title sponsor and shall cause to display Prolong associate sponsor decal signage upon the middle side panel (between car number and rear tire; both sides of car) with dimensions of approximately 6 inches high by 16 inches long.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'primary sponsor' to 'title sponsor' introduces potential confusion. The term 'primary sponsor' could be interpreted as one of the sponsors or the single biggest sponsor. However, 'title sponsor' is usually understood as the sponsor whose name is included in the race team or event name which might not always be the same as the primary sponsor. Thus, the ambiguity regarding who approves the paint schemes.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'primary, secondary, or associate sponsor' to 'major, minor, or general sponsor' creates contradiction because the terms are undefined within the context of this legal document. These changes introduce conflicting interpretations of the intended scope and limitations of Sabco's representation of other companies, potentially leading to disputes over which types of sponsorships are prohibited under the agreement.",

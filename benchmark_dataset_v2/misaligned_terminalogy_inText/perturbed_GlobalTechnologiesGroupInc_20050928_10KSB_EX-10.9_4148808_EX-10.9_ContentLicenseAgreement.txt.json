Licensee's distribution of the Programming is subject to the Master Terms of Service (\"MTS\") attached hereto as Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' is replaced with 'Licensee' in the second instance. Later in the document it uses 'Distributor' as originally intended, creating a contradiction about who has the distribution rights and responsibilities.",

Distributor Site is more fully described in Section A of the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor's Site' is changed to 'Channel's Site.' While 'Distributor' remains defined, this modification implies that 'Channel' is the entity responsible for the website. This creates confusion about which entity (Distributor or Channel) owns and operates the website where the Programming is promoted. Since 'Channel' is undefined it's difficult to decide which entity has what responsibility and control.",

                "explanation": "The section is renamed to 'Licensee Warranty and Indemnification,' but the subsequent text refers to 'Distributor' still having responsibility.

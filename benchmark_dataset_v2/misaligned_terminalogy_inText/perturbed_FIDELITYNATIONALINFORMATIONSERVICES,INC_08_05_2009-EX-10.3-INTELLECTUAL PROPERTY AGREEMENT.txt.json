Except as set forth on Exhibit B, no other assets (other than Transferred Equifax Third Party Agreements) are being transferred by Equifax (or a member of the Equifax Group) pursuant to this Agreement.",

The modified license changes 'non-exclusive' to 'exclusive' and 'perpetual' to 'time-limited,' immediately contradicting the earlier grant.

The modified text limits Equifax's responsibility to only 'reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Certegy', thus limiting Equifax's responsibility to only costs incurred by Certegy.

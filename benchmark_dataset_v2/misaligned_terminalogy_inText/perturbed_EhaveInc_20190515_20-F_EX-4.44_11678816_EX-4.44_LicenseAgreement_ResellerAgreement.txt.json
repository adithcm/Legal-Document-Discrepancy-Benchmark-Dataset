                "explanation": "The terms 'customers' and 'clients' are used interchangeably to refer to the same entities obtaining services from CHT. This creates ambiguity because it is not explicitly stated in the contract that 'customers' and 'clients' are synonymous, potentially leading to confusion regarding contractual obligations and rights associated with each term.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that CHT is appointed as a 'reseller,' while the changed text refers to CHT as a 'distributor.' These roles can carry different responsibilities and rights in business, and by not defining them consistently, the contract's obligations become ambiguous. For example, a distributor might be expected to provide more extensive marketing support than a reseller.",

It is unclear whether the two terms refer to the same legal document, which could lead to enforcement issues if the specific type of agreement required is disputed.",

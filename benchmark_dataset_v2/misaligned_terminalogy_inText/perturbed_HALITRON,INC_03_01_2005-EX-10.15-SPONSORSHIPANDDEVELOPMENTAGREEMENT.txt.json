                "original_text": "Smith agrees to cooperate in good faith with TDA in connection with TDA's exercise of the Rights in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Smith agrees to cooperate in good faith with TDA in connection with TDA's exercise of the Privileges in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Rights' is a defined term in Section 2.1. Replacing it with 'Privileges,' which is undefined, creates ambiguity and confusion about what Smith is obligated to cooperate with. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement as it is unclear if 'Privileges' are equivalent to 'Rights'.",

                "explanation": "The agreement uses 'Rights' (defined in Section 2.1) regarding publicity and use of Smith's likeness. By substituting 'Rights' with 'Likenesses', the scope of permitted activities after the agreement's term becomes unclear. 'Likenesses' implies only the image itself is restricted, not broader promotional activities tied to Smith, potentially conflicting with the original intent and creating an enforcement gap.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Term' to 'Duration' in the definition, while still referencing the 'Exclusivity Period' which is defined in relation to the 'Term,' creates confusion. Throughout the document, 'Term' is used extensively. Using 'Duration' in the definition while maintaining 'Term' elsewhere creates uncertainty as to which time period is being referenced, especially when calculating royalties or post-term sales rights. Does 'Exclusivity Period' end the 'Duration' or the 'Term'?",

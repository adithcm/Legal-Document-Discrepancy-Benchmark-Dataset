                "original_text": "1.21 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective (e.g., Development Activities and Commercialization hereunder), the level of efforts consistent with the efforts and resources [***] of similar market potential, at a similar stage in development or product lifecycle, taking into account the stage of development or product lifecycle of other of [***] product candidates, safety and efficacy, product profile, cost of goods, the competitiveness of the marketplace, such company's patent position with respect to such product (including such company's ability to obtain or enforce, or have obtained or enforced, such patent rights), the Third Party patent landscape relevant to the product, the regulatory structure involved, the likelihood of regulatory approval, the likelihood and extent of anticipated or actual profitability of the applicable product, and other technical, legal, scientific and medical considerations. Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",
                "changed_text": "1.21 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" or \"Good Faith Efforts\" means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective (e.g., Development Activities and Commercialization hereunder), the level of efforts consistent with the efforts and resources [***] of similar market potential, at a similar stage in development or product lifecycle, taking into account the stage of development or product lifecycle of other of [***] product candidates, safety and efficacy, product profile, cost of goods, the competitiveness of the marketplace, such company's patent position with respect to such product (including such company's ability to obtain or enforce, or have obtained or enforced, such patent rights), the Third Party patent landscape relevant to the product, the regulatory structure involved, the likelihood of regulatory approval, the likelihood and extent of anticipated or actual profitability of the applicable product, and other technical, legal, scientific and medical considerations.

                "explanation": "By defining 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' as interchangeable with 'Good Faith Efforts', the agreement creates ambiguity about the actual level of effort required. 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' usually implies a more objective and resource-intensive standard than 'Good Faith Efforts', potentially leading to disputes on the effort required.",

                "changed_text": "1.50 \"Net Sales\" or \"Revenue\" means, with respect to a Product, the gross amount invoiced for sales of a Product by a Selling Party to Third Parties for end use, less the following deductions from such gross amounts to the extent attributable to such Product and to the extent actually incurred, allowed, accrued or specifically allocated:\n\n(a) credits or allowances actually granted for damaged Product, returns or rejections of Product, price adjustments and billing errors;\n\n(b) governmental and other rebates (or equivalents thereof) granted to managed health care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers (or equivalents thereof), federal, state, provincial, local and other governments, their agencies and purchasers and reimbursers or to trade customers;\n\n(c) normal and customary trade, cash and quantity discounts, allowances and credits actually allowed or paid;\n\n(d) payments made as part of a Co-pay Program for a Product; and\n\n(e) sales taxes, VAT taxes and other taxes directly linked to the sales of Product;\n\nall as determined in accordance with IFRS on a basis not consistent with the Selling Party's annual audited financial statements.",
                "explanation": "By making 'Net Sales' and 'Revenue' the same it contradicts how 'Net Sales' is calculated later in the definition. In addition, changing 'consistent with' to 'not consistent with', now means the Net Sales is calculated *not* according to IFRS rules, and further introduces contradictions and ambiguities, making enforcement harder.",

                "explanation": "The replacement of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' with 'Best Efforts' creates an in-text contradiction, despite the initial definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' being provided in Section 1.21. This is because 'Best Efforts' implies a higher and stricter standard of performance for Aimmune's development obligations.",

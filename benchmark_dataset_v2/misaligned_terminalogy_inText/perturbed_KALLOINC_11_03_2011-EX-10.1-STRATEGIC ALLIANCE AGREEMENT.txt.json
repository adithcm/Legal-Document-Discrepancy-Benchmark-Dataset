                "explanation": "Changing 'sells' to 'markets' creates ambiguity. Does the Business Associate have the authority to finalize sales, or just promote the products? This introduces uncertainty in their obligations.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'material breach' with 'significant issue', it is not clear what level of non-compliance is acceptable. Does a 'significant issue' lead to termination, penalties, or just a discussion? This ambiguity creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

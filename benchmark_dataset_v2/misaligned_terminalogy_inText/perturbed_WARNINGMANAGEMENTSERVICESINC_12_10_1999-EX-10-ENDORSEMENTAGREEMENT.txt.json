                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Company desires to obtain the right to use the name, likeness and endorsement of Peyton Manning (hereinafter called \"Manning\") in connection with the advertisement, promotion and sale of Company's \"Products\" (hereinafter defined); and WHEREAS, Manning has granted such rights to Pey Dirt together with the right to sublicense such rights.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Company desires to obtain the right to use the name, likeness and endorsement of Peyton Manning (hereinafter called \"Manning\") in connection with the advertisement, promotion and sale of Company's \"Products\" (hereinafter defined); and WHEREAS, Manning has granted such rights to Pey Dirt together with the right to license such rights to Third Parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text indicates that Manning granted Pey Dirt the right to sublicense the rights, but the modified version indicates that Pey Dirt can only grant rights to \"Third Parties\", not explicitly sublicensing. This introduces a contradiction on whether Pey Dirt can further transfer the rights granted.",

Failure of Company to comply with the provisions of this Section 2(b) shall entitle Pey Dirt to revoke this license immediately (notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary).",
                "changed_text": "(b) Company agrees that during the Contract Period it will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) promote the sale of all Endorsed Products in the Contract Territory, and (ii) discourage the sale of any Endorsed Products outside the Contract Territory. Failure of Company to comply with the provisions of this Section 2(b) may entitle Pey Dirt to revoke this license (notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary).",
                "explanation": "The original text holds the Company to a \"best efforts actively and aggressively\" standard, whereas the modified version replaces that with a \"commercially reasonable efforts\" standard. Also, the original provides Pey Dirt with the entitlement to revocation of the license for breach, whereas the modified version just says that Pey Dirt may revoke such license, removing the sense of obligation.",

Unless such election has been made in writing, all payments shall be made by check drawn to the order of \"Pey Dirt, Inc.\" and delivered to IMG, Suite 100, 1360 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, Attn.: Peter Johnson. Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of (i) one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month, or (ii) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less.",

Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at a rate to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Pey Dirt decides the method of payment. The modified version states that Company decides the method of payment, and removes a definitive interest rate for late payments, replacing it with a vague requirement of 'mutual agreement', leading to enforcement issues.",

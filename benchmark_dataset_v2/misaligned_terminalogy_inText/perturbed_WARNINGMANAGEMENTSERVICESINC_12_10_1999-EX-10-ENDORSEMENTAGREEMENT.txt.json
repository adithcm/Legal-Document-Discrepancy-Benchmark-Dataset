                "explanation": "Multiple changes here introduce contradictions.  'Company' changed to 'Famous Fixins, Inc.', 'Endorsed Products' changed to 'Breakfast Items' (as changed earlier), 'royalty' is replaced with 'fee', 'actual invoice price' is replaced with 'agreed upon price'. Also, 'exclusive only of shipping charges and sales taxes' is replaced with 'inclusive of shipping charges and sales taxes' and the rate is changed from 8.5% to 5%. These changes create uncertainty about the method of royalty calculation.",

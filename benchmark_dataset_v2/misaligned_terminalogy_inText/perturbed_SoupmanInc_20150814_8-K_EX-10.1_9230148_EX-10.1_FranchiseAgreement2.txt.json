                "original_text": "Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Guarantors will remit to Franchisor some funds owed by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement, subject to resource availabilities and at mutually agreed upon schedules.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Guarantors 'shall pay' all monies owed by the Master Franchisee, establishing a clear and unconditional payment obligation. The modified version replaces 'shall pay' with 'will remit some funds,' introducing ambiguity about the extent of their payment obligation, and makes it contingent on 'resource availabilities' and a 'mutually agreed upon schedule,' effectively undermining the guarantee's enforceability and conflicting with the strict liability established in the original text.",

                "changed_text": "Guarantors may assist in the general satisfaction of the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement, depending on their capacity and willingness to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes an 'unconditional guarantee' for 'full performance' by the Master Franchisee. The revised text changes the nature of obligation. Replacing 'unconditionally guarantee full performance' with 'may assist in the general satisfaction' and adding 'depending on their capacity and willingness' introduces subjectivity, rendering the guarantee non-binding and contradicting the explicit commitment outlined in the original clause.",

                "changed_text": "Guarantors are encouraged to provide appropriate support to protect Franchisor from select damages to the degree they consider reasonable, where Master Franchisee's failure in performance can be well substantiated.",
                "explanation": "The original section enforces an 'indemnify and save harmless' obligation on the Guarantors regarding any losses or damages the Franchisor faces due to the Master Franchisee's failure. The modified version changes the nature of the obligation from 'shall indemnify and save harmless' to 'are encouraged to provide appropriate support', and introduces subjectivity by adding terms such as 'to the degree they consider reasonable' and 'can be well substantiated,' thereby weakening the protection offered to the Franchisor and directly contradicting the initial indemnity clause.",

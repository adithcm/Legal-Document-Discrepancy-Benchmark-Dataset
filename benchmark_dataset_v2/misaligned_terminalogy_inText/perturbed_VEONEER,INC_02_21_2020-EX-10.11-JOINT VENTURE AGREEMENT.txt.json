                "original_text": "As of the VNBJ Closing, except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the JV Agreement shall immediately cease to have any application or effect with respect to VNBJ, all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate and all references to \"Company\" or \"Companies\" in the JV Agreement (either in the body of the JV Agreement or its schedules and other attachments) shall read and be interpreted to mean VNBZ and/or ANRA except as the context otherwise requires.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces confusion by replacing 'Company' with 'Business.' While 'Company' is a defined term related to specific entities (VNBJ, VNBZ, ANRA), 'Business' is not clearly defined, potentially altering the scope and application of the JV Agreement's provisions after the VNBJ Closing. It's unclear if 'Business' refers to the operations of those companies or something broader.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the termination of the JV Agreement with respect to VNBJ, VNBZ or the Veoneer Parties shall not release any Veoneer Participant or any Nissin Participant from liability for the breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or understandings set forth in the JV Agreement that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation replaces 'Party' with 'Participant' and 'agreements' with 'understandings'. The terms 'Veoneer Party' and 'Nissin Party' are well defined. Substituting them with 'Participant' introduces ambiguity, as it's unclear if this includes subsidiaries, affiliates, or other related entities. Similarly, replacing 'agreements' with 'understandings' weakens the enforceability, as 'understandings' can be interpreted as less formal and binding than formal 'agreements'.",

                "explanation": "The agreement is initially referred to as an \"Amendment.\" By changing this to an \"Adjustment,\" the legal basis could be questioned as to which agreement is actually enforceable. The term is changed without further clarification.",

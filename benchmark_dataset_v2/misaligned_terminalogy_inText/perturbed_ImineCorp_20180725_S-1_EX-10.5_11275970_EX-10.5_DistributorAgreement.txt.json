                "explanation": "Changing 'Distributor' to 'recipient' creates confusion regarding who is responsible for shipping costs, import formalities, and who receives the product. The contract defines distributor previously, but not recipient. This could be interpreted as anyone receiving the goods, removing obligation from the defined distributor. This contradicts the defined role of the Distributor in Section 2.1.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Warranty' with 'Guarantee', 'Distributor' with 'vendor'/'client', and 'Products' with 'items' creates multiple layers of confusion. 'Guarantee' is not defined, so it is unclear if it has the same meaning as warranty. By using 'vendor' and 'client' interchangeably with 'Distributor,' it becomes unclear who is bound by the warranty terms. Plus, replacing 'Products' with 'items' and not changing it back causes a contradiction of which product should be in question.",

The term 'Subscriber' may also refer to ELEPHANT TALK Customers and might include the mobile end-users of ELEPHANT TALK Customers, subject to the interpretation of the specific provision.",
                "explanation": "The introduction of the term 'Subscriber' as potentially interchangeable with 'ELEPHANT TALK Customer' creates ambiguity. While the original definition is clear, the added term introduces uncertainty about whether all obligations and rights applicable to 'ELEPHANT TALK Customer' also extend to 'Subscriber', especially in later sections of the contract.",

These services may also be referred to as 'Network Access' throughout this document.",
                "explanation": "Adding \"These services may also be referred to as 'Network Access' throughout this document\" creates a contradiction because the definition of \"Hosting Service(s)\" is precise, while \"Network Access\" is a broader term that is not explicitly defined. This leads to uncertainty about whether all sections referencing \"Network Access\" are intended to impose the same obligations and rights as those regarding the \"Hosting Service(s)\".",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that Elephant Talk is accountable for all traffic by its customers, including that from stolen SIM cards. The added sentence \"For the avoidance of doubt, 'traffic charges' refers to charges to only paying clients\" now introduces the idea that Elephant Talk will only be accountable for those traffic charges that are to paying clients. This contradicts the prior statement where they were also responsible for non-paying generated traffic.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'acceptance' and 'approval' are used interchangeably without clear definition of their distinct implications. This creates ambiguity about whether a formal acceptance test is sufficient or if additional approval is required, affecting the enforcement of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The substitution of 'Services' with 'Tasks' without defining 'Tasks' creates a contradiction. While the agreement specifies 'Services,' introducing 'Tasks' implies a different set of obligations, making it unclear whether HealthGate is responsible for all tasks or only those explicitly defined as 'Services.'",

HealthGate shall collect the Article Fees established by             Publishers plus a service fee to be determined by HealthGate but in             any event the service fee may not exceed 30% of the Article Fee for             the particular article, or $US 4, whichever is the higher.

                "explanation": "Changing \"Article Fees\" to \"Sales Fees\" and then referring back to \"Article Fees\" creates contradiction as to which fees HealthGate is actually collecting. Whether it's referring to all sales, or only sales associated with \"Articles\".",

                "explanation": "Using \"indemnify\" and \"reimburse\" interchangeably creates confusion about MSL's precise responsibility. Indemnification typically covers protecting against potential losses, whereas reimbursement is for direct repayment of expenses. The different terms are used to denote the same action, but they are not defined as such and are different legal requirements.",

                "explanation": "\"Breach\" and \"default\" are used as synonyms. Although they're often used in similar contexts, \"breach\" typically refers to a failure to perform a contractual obligation, whereas \"default\" can encompass a broader range of failures, including financial defaults. Using the term \"breach\" implies a very distinct legal action whereas using the term \"default\" introduces uncertainty about what falls under the purview of the cause of action.",

If the Parties do not settle the matter within [***] ([***]) days after the delivery by one Party of written notice (the \"Arbitration Notice\") to the other Party involved, then the Parties will submit the matter to binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware. All matters so submitted to arbitration will be settled by three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the [***], or its successor (the \"[***] Rules\"). In the event of a conflict between [***] Rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. Each Party will designate an arbitrator and the Parties will cause the designated arbitrators to mutually agree upon and to designate a third arbitrator who will serve as chairperson; provided, however, that failing such agreement within [***] ([***]) days of delivery of the Arbitration Notice, the third (3rd) arbitrator will be appointed in accordance with [***] Rules within an additional [***] ([***]) days. The Parties shall arrange for a hearing to occur and be completed within [***] ([***]) days after the appointment of the third (3rd) arbitrator, which hearing shall last no longer than [***], unless the arbitral panel believes a longer period is required, in which case the hearing may last [***]. The Parties will cause the arbitrators to decide the matter to be arbitrated within [***] ([***]) days after the close of evidence unless the chairperson arbitrator determines, at the request of any Party or on his or her own initiative, that such time period should be extended, in which case such time period may not be extended beyond an additional [***] ([***]) day period. Each of Ginkgo and BLI will be permitted to serve one set of document production requests with no more than [***] ([***]) requests; no more than [***] ([***]) interrogatories, including subparts, no more than [***] ([***]) requests for admissions; no more than [***] ([***]) subpoenas to Third Parties; and no more than [***] ([***]) notices of deposition per side, in each case, unless the arbitral panel directs otherwise. Any documents not in English that are produced by a Party will be accompanied by a translation into English, which translation will not be binding upon the other Party or the arbitrators. Each Party covenants and agrees that (a) it will produce documents as required by this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution), and (b) it will make its employees, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to make its former employees, available for depositions and hearing testimony as requested by the other Party. The final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be in writing, in all events follow governing law and will be furnished to all the Parties in such dispute. Judgment on such decision may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators' award. Except as required by Applicable Law or to enforce an arbitrators' award, neither Party may disclose the existence, contents or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with this Agreement, or the evidence produced by its opposing Parties, or any analysis or summaries derived from such evidence. The Parties agree that all applicable statutes of limitation and time-based defenses (such as estoppel and laches) will be tolled while the procedures set forth in this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) are pending. The Parties will cooperate in taking any actions necessary to achieve this result. Except as may be determined by the arbitrators, neither Party shall be penalized for delays resulting from dispute resolution conducted pursuant to this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution).",

                "explanation": "The term “arbitration” is changed to “intervention,” yet “intervention” is not defined, nor do the powers of intervenors equal that of arbitrators under the applicable rules, which creates problems with enforceability and is not a clear method for dispute resolution.",

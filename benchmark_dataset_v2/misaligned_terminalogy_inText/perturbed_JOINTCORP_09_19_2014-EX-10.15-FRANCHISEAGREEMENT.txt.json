                "explanation": "Changing 'Franchise Owner' to 'Location Owner' and 'Franchisee' to 'Licensee,' and 'Principal Owners' to 'Main Owners' introduces inconsistent terminology, as the contract continues to use the original terms in subsequent sections, creating confusion about which terms are interchangeable.",

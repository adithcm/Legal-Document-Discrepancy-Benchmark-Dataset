                "original_text": "1.1      \"Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO)\" means the maximum                   daily quantity of natural gas, expressed in Dekatherms (Dth),                   that Transporter is obligated to deliver from time to time at                   the Point(s) of Delivery specified in Exhibit B to the                   executed Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.1      \"Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO)\" means the average                   daily quantity of natural gas, expressed in Dekatherms (Dth),                   that Transporter is obligated to deliver from time to time at                   the Point(s) of Delivery specified in Exhibit B to the                   executed Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'maximum' to 'average' in the definition of MDDO creates a contradiction. Later clauses rely on MDDO as a maximum limit, leading to uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The contract initially mentions 'month to month' as the term post the 'primary term' of 10 years. Changing this to 'year to year' creates conflicting obligations since it is unclear what the exact agreement is after the initial term.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'and' to 'or' in the amendment clause allows either party to unilaterally amend the agreement. This directly contradicts the initial requirement of mutual agreement, creating uncertainty in the enforcement of any amendments. This change affects the balance of power and contractual integrity.",

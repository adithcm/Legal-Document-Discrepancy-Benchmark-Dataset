It's unclear if the 'Subsidiary' is equivalent to 'Company' or if a different entity is receiving rights. The 'Subsidiary's Field' lacks a clear definition, thus creating uncertainty whether it is equivalent to the 'Company Field', potentially narrowing or broadening the scope of the trademark license.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Buyer Entities' is replaced with 'Buyer,' and the term 'Sublicensees' has been replaced by 'Affiliates' in the exception clause. By altering 'Buyer Entities' to 'Buyer,' it potentially narrows the scope of responsibility to only the direct buyer, excluding other related entities involved in the IP management. The alteration from 'Sublicensees' to 'Affiliates' raises the question of whether IP created by affiliates is treated differently, which can impact ownership and licensing rights.",

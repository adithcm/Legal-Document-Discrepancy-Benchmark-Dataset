                "explanation": "The definition of 'Nortel' is narrowed to only include NTL, excluding its Subsidiaries. Then, 'Nortel Entity' is changed to any entity designated by NTL, this creates confusion on the scope of Nortel's obligations, and rights which were initially meant for Subsidiaries are now solely for NTL, contradicting the original broad definition.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'irrevocable' to 'revocable' license directly contradicts the intended permanency of the license granted to Nortel.

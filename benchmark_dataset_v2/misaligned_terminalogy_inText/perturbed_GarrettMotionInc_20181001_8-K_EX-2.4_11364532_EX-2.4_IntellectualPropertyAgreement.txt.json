With regard to the Honeywell Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that SpinCo has the freedom to use such Honeywell Shared IP in the future. Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for \"have-made\" purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Honeywell Shared IP\" to \"Honeywell Shared Assets\" introduces an inconsistency. While both terms are intended to refer to the same set of intellectual property, this change could create confusion as to whether the term 'Assets' has a distinct meaning in the contract, particularly since IP is a subset of assets. This could lead to disputes over which specific rights or items are covered under this section. This is because the document previously defined \"Honeywell IP\" and now is referencing 'Honeywell Shared Assets' without definition and in a similar construct.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"SpinCo IP\" to \"SpinCo Intellectual Assets\" without redefining it creates uncertainty. While 'IP' refers to intellectual property rights, 'Intellectual Assets' is broader, and could include tangible assets related to IP, potentially conflicting with the defined scope of SpinCo IP. This difference could cause disputes over the enforcement of these covenants.",

                "explanation": "Switching from 'reasonable best efforts' to 'commercially reasonable efforts' changes the level of obligation. 'Reasonable best efforts' requires a higher standard of diligence and a greater commitment than 'commercially reasonable efforts,' which allows the party to consider their own economic interests. This discrepancy can lead to conflict because the contract now uses different standards for the same general obligation of fulfilling the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The modified section alters the conditions under which the AS Parties can terminate the agreement. Specifically, it changes the dismissal timeframe for bankruptcy proceedings from 45 days to 30 days and appointment of court-appointed officials from 45 days to 60 days, creating inconsistencies in the termination clauses.",

                "explanation": "Here, there is a change of ownership in subsection (c) to 'jointly' from 'exclusively to the AS Parties.' This creates ambiguity over who truly owns the trademarks and associated rights, conflicting with the earlier statement.",

                "original_text": "MusclePharm shall be responsible for the following expenses: · Exclusive private jet transportation (Netjets, or as otherwise indicated by Endorser) to be arranged through M. Paul Wachter or Alex Cohen; · A first class suite at a hotel of Endorser's choice; · A security detail; and · A reasonable per diem expense allowance while Endorser is on location.",

                "explanation": "This change alters the scope and nature of expenses MusclePharm is responsible for. Replacing 'Exclusive private jet' with 'Private jet' implies that MusclePharm has the freedom to get a cheaper flight, changing 'A first class suite at a hotel of Endorser's choice' to 'A standard hotel room' puts a limit on hotel quality, adding 'only for events with over 100 attendees' to security detail limits the number of events where security will be provided, and changing 'A reasonable per diem expense allowance' to 'at the discretion of MusclePharm's CFO' give MuslcePharm control over the per diem expense, creating uncertainty and potential conflict over covered expenses.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Licensed Products\" to \"Endorsed Items\" introduces a contradiction because later sections refer specifically to 'Licensed Products' with defined royalty and marketing budget implications. This alteration makes it unclear which items are subject to those specific financial terms.",

It is no longer clear whether the distribution restriction only applies to \"Sponsored Products\" during the first contract year, and also impacts the definition of \"Distribution Channels.\"",

                "explanation": "Changing “Licensed Products” to “Partner Products” and 'approval' to 'consent' introduces confusion. Since there's no definition of “Partner Products,” and the rest of the agreement relies on “Licensed Products”, it's unclear whether advertising restrictions apply to all products or just those marketed by MusclePharm's partners. It also could be argued that if the agreement now uses the term 'consent', the endorser can reasonably withhold that consent, whereas previously, the agreement specified the endorser cannot 'unreasonably withhold approval'.",

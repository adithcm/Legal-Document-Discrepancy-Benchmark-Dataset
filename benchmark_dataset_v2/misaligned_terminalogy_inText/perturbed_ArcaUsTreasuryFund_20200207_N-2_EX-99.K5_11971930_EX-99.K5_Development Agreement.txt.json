                "explanation": "The term 'Adviser' is replaced with 'Investment Manager' but is not consistently applied throughout. Both ‘Adviser’ and ‘Investment Manager’ are now used. This creates confusion as to whether the Blockchain Administrator has two roles, or if ‘Investment Manager’ refers to a different entity entirely.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'stockholder servicing agents' has been changed to 'shareholder servicing agents.' While these terms are often used interchangeably, the document now uses both terms without explicitly defining them as equivalent, raising questions of whether they refer to slightly different roles or responsibilities. Additionally, the phrase 'Blockchain Administrator' was changed to 'Blockchain Provider'.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'Fund shall pay' was changed to 'Fund shall provide with compensation' and 'Trustees' was changed to 'Directors'. By using different terms to describe the compensation process, this implies a different way of compensation, or that 'providing compensation' refers to a benefit beyond direct payment. Furthermore, the change of 'Administrator' to 'Vendor' and 'Trustees' to 'Directors', creates doubt about whether the contract refers to the same roles. ",

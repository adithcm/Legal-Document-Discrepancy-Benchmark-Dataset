                "explanation": "The term 'Developer' is replaced with 'Vendor.' While both might seem synonymous, later clauses refer specifically to the 'Developer' responsibilities. Using 'Vendor' introduces ambiguity about which entity is bound by those clauses, creating potential enforcement issues.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Developer' with 'Contractor' changes the IP transfer obligation. While the initial definition uses 'Developer,' later, the term 'Contractor' is used. This creates confusion about who is legally obliged to transfer the IP rights upon project completion. It raises the question: does 'Contractor' encompass the original 'Developer' or a separate entity?",

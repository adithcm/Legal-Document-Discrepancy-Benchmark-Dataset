However, for the purposes of Part 2 only, 'Affiliate' shall mean any entity directly or indirectly controlled by the party, regardless of the level of ownership.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' is altered to have a different meaning in Part 2 of the agreement, specifically widening its scope. This introduces an inconsistency as to which entities are bound by the non-competition clauses, potentially creating loopholes or disputes.",

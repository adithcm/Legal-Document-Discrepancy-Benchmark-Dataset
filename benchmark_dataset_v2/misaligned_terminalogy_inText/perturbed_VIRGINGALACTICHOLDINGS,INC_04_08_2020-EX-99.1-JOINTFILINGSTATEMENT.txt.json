It is unclear if 'undersigned' and 'participants' refer to the same group, creating uncertainty about who is bound by the agreement. Also, it's unclear if 'subsequent amendments' and 'later updates' refer to the same process, creating uncertainty about the update procedure.",

While generally understood, 'Effective' can imply a specific activation date different from the signature date. Shortening 'Chief Financial Officer' to 'CFO' could introduce ambiguity if other officers or roles are involved, potentially affecting the validity of the signatures.",

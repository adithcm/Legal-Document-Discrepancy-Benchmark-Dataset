                "original_text": "4.3. Delivery Terms. Each purchase order shall specify: (i) an identification of the API ordered; (ii) quantity requested; (iii) the requested delivery date; and (iv) shipping instructions and address. HOVIONE agrees to deliver the API DDP Menlo Park, CA USA (Incoterms 2010).",

Each purchase order shall specify: (i) an identification of the API ordered; (ii) quantity requested; (iii) the requested delivery date; and (iv) shipping instructions and address. HOVIONE agrees to arrange for the API to be available for pickup by INTERSECT at HOVIONE's facility. Shipping shall be the responsibility of the Customer.",
                "explanation": "The original text states HOVIONE is responsible for delivery DDP Menlo Park, CA USA. The modified text shifts the responsibility to INTERSECT, referred to as 'Customer', to pick up the API from HOVIONE's facility. This creates a direct contradiction regarding who bears the responsibility and cost of shipping. This contradicts Section 2.1 and could cause disputes over shipping costs and liability during transit.",

Within thirty (30) calendar days of the arrival of each lot of API at the manufacturing facility designated by INTERSECT, INTERSECT shall inspect and test each lot of API at its own cost and expense. If, upon inspecting and testing the API, INTERSECT determines that a lot of API does not conform to the Product Specifications, then INTERSECT shall, within such thirty (30) day period, give HOVIONE written notice of such non-conformity (setting forth the details of such non-conformity):Unless HOVIONE objects, within 20 working days from the notice by INTERSECT, to the non-conformity INTERSECT will return the non-conforming API to HOVIONE. Any API rejected by INTERSECT may not be reshipped to INTERSECT except if the API is reprocessed according to the DMF. HOVIONE sole responsibility shall be to replace any non-conforming API within thirty (30) days of receiving the notice of non- conformity.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that HOVIONE's sole responsibility is to replace any non-conforming API within thirty days of receiving the notice. The modified text states that HOVIONE's sole responsibility is to provide a refund. This creates a contradiction, changing the remedy for non-conforming API from replacement to a monetary refund.  This could lead to disputes about whether INTERSECT prefers a replacement or a refund and which remedy is legally binding.",

Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10, COMPANY will: 10.5.2.1. promptly pay HOVIONE any monies due and owing HOVIONE, up to the time of termination, for API actually manufactured, all authorized expenses actually incurred and any uncancellable commitments made by HOVIONE in connection with the scope of this Agreement; and 10.5.2.2. promptly return all Confidential Information of HOVIONE that it has received pursuant to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that INTERSECT fully pay any outstanding dues to HOVIONE up to the point of termination. The updated version directly contradicts this by stating that INTERSECT only needs to pay 50% of those dues. This establishes an in-text contradiction concerning the financial responsibilities of INTERSECT upon termination of the agreement.",

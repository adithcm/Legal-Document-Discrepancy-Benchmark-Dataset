                "explanation": "The term 'Purpose' is replaced with 'Goal'. While seemingly synonymous, 'Purpose' is defined in relation to the marketing of the processed product. Using 'Goal' introduces ambiguity as 'Goal' is not consistently or clearly defined, potentially leading to confusion regarding the specific intentions and obligations of Ultragenyx as related to its business activities with the product.",

                "explanation": "The term \"Product Specifications\" is replaced with \"Product Standards\". This creates confusion as the agreement refers to Annex A as both \"Product Specifications\" and \"Product Standards\". Whether these terms hold the same legal meaning is uncertain, leading to disputes over the criteria for acceptable product quality. It will remain unsure which definition is relevant.",

                "explanation": "The use of 'guidelines' instead of 'specifications' in relation to the 'Product' and Annex A introduces a critical ambiguity. 'Specifications' implies a set of precise and mandatory requirements that the product must meet. 'Guidelines' suggests a more flexible set of recommendations. This change will affect how the quality and acceptability of the Product are judged.",

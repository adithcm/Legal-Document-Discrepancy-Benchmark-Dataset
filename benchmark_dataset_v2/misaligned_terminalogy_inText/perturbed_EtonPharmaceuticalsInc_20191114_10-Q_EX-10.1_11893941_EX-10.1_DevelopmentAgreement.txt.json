                "explanation": "The term 'product' is replaced with 'compound'. While seemingly similar, 'compound' could be interpreted more narrowly to refer only to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, whereas 'product' implies the final, formulated drug. This creates potential ambiguity regarding what exactly Aucta is obligated to supply.",

Agreement and Understanding may be the same thing in some situations, in the field of legal drafting, substituting one term with the other can create confusion or be misinterpreted.

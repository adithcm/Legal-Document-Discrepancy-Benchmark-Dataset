                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Issuer appoints the Sponsor as sponsor of the Offering and the Sponsor accepts the appointment and agrees to act as sponsor of the Issuer under the Prospectus on the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Issuer engages the Sponsor as advisor for the Offering, and the Sponsor accepts the engagement and agrees to provide advisory services to the Issuer under the Prospectus on the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The term 'sponsor' is replaced with 'advisor'. This change introduces ambiguity regarding the Sponsor's role, duties, and responsibilities. 'Sponsor' suggests a formal endorsement and a higher degree of responsibility to ensure regulatory compliance, whereas 'advisor' implies a more limited scope of counsel and guidance. This creates uncertainty about the Sponsor's liability concerning the accuracy and completeness of the Prospectus.",

                "original_text": "As sponsor of the Issuer under the Prospectus, the Sponsor will conduct an investigation of the organization, management, business and affairs of the Issuer sufficient, in its sole discretion, to enable it to determine whether or not it is able to sign the certificate of the Prospectus.",
                "changed_text": "As consultant to the Issuer under the Prospectus, the Sponsor may conduct a review of the organization, management, business, and affairs of the Issuer as it deems necessary to provide informed recommendations.",
                "explanation": "Replaces 'sponsor' with 'consultant' and 'investigation' with 'review', changing the required intensity of their analysis. Also, the original text ties the investigation to the ability to 'sign the certificate', a critical legal function of a sponsor, while the modified text describes a discretionary review for 'informed recommendations', which is far less committal, potentially conflicting with other clauses.",
                "location": "2.2"
            },
            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For the services of the Sponsor as sponsor of the Offering and as full and complete compensation therefor, the Issuer will pay to the Sponsor the sum of $32,100 (inclusive of Goods and Services Tax), the receipt of which is acknowledged by the Sponsor.",
                "changed_text": "For the services of the Sponsor as service provider for the Offering and as compensation, the Issuer will pay to the Sponsor mutually agreed-upon fees as outlined in a separate service level agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replaces 'sponsor' with 'service provider' and removes a fixed price, alluding to another agreement. It could mean that a service level agreement (SLA) is in place, which may or may not detail the payment amount. If the SLA is absent or incomplete, it is unclear which SLA is being referred to, leading to confusion. The uncertainty creates a potential dispute point over the fee structure.",

For the avoidance of doubt, after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Village Media Company and its permitted licensees shall continue to have the right to fully exploit, use, and Exploit the HOFV Works for the length of the term of the license granted by PFHOF in connection with such HOFV Work pursuant to Section 2.3; provided that the length of the term of such license shall be a minimum of five (5) years.",

                "explanation": "The original text states \"permitted licensees,\" but the modified text changes \"permitted licensees\" to \"permitted assignees\" and changes 'license' to 'authorization'. The original text states that the length of the license shall be a minimum of five (5) years, and is contradicted by changing it to one (1) year. This creates ambiguity in the definition of licensees/assignees and the length of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The modified text changes \"Annual Guarantee\" to \"Annual Payment,\" making it unclear whether these terms are interchangeable. Further, replacing 'shall' to 'may' introduces uncertainty. The original text indicates that the payment shall be payable to PFHOF on each twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date during the Term, and is contradicted by changing it to eighteen (18) months. This creates ambiguity in the agreed payment schedule.",

                "explanation": "The agreement now uses 'Client' and 'Customer' without defining them, even though they refer to the same entity (The Associated Press). This introduces confusion about which term governs obligations throughout the contract. 'Client' and 'Customer' used interchangeably.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Customer' is now replaced by its specific name, 'The Associated Press', without clear indication of whether it is still referencing the same entity, leading to uncertainty in interpreting the non-solicitation clause. This creates an inconsistency. The usage of `The Associated Press` instead of `Customer` may be interpreted that this paragraph references to only the AP, but not in other instances when `Customer` is used.",

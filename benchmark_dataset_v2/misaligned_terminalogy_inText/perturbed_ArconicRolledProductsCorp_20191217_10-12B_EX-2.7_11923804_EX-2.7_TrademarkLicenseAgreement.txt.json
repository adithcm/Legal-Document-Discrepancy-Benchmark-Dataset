Licensor on behalf of itself and its Affliates hereby grants to Licensee the limited licenses to use and have used the Licensed Mark: (i) for the Licensed Products as set forth on Schedule 2; and (ii) as set forth on Schedule 1, concerning agreements entered into by Licensee prior to the Effective Date (\"Existing Agreements\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor also grants to Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license for continued use of the Licensed Mark for the production and sale of inventory containing the Licensed Mark applied to such products during the Transition Period as set forth in section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and in Schedule 2 of this Agreement. Licensee will not, however, use the Licensed Mark except for the production and sale of inventory as provided in this Section 1.1 and in Section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Schedule 2 of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'license' and 'permission' are used interchangeably, creating confusion about the legal weight and scope of the rights granted. It is unclear whether 'permission' provides the same level of protection and enforceability as a 'license'. Also, Licensor and Licensee are renamed to Arconic and Arconic Rolled Products respectively.",

                "explanation": "The word 'right' is replaced with 'discretion', and 'approve' is replaced with 'oversee and sanction'. This changes the power balance. 'Right' implies an entitlement, where 'discretion' implies choice; and 'approve' necessitates an answer, but 'oversee and sanction' is vague and not guaranteed. 'Consent' is replaced with 'sanction', which makes the language unclear. The Licensor is also renamed to Arconic.",

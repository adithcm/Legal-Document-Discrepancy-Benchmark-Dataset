Each of On2 and Wildform shall appoint a representative to act as its primary contact person for the provision of all of the Transition Services (collectively, the \"Primary Coordinators\"). The initial Primary Coordinators shall be Chris Schapdick for On2 and Jonathan Blank for Wildform. Each party may treat an act of a Primary Coordinator of another party as being authorized by such other party without inquiring behind such act or ascertaining whether such Primary Coordinator had authority to so act. Wildform and On2 shall advise each other in writing of any change in the Primary Coordinators, setting forth the name of the Primary Coordinator to be replaced and the name of the replacement, and certifying that the replacement Primary Coordinator is authorized to act for such party in all matters relating to this Agreement. Each of On2 and Wildform agree that all communications relating to the provision of the Transition Services shall be directed to the Primary Coordinators.",

                "explanation": "The modified version introduces 'designated representative', distinct from 'Primary Coordinators,' potentially enabling actions by unauthorized personnel. The removal of the requirement to certify that the 'replacement Primary Coordinator is authorized to act for such party in all matters relating to this Agreement' creates uncertainty about the authorized personnel.",

Subject to payment by On2 of the Closing Date Payment Amount in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, Wildform shall deliver each Deliverable in accordance with the timeframe (the \"Timeframe\") set forth in Exhibit B, which Exhibit is made a part of this Agreement. On2 will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Wildform as necessary in completing the Development Work and delivery of the Deliverables. Upon receipt of each Deliverable, On2 shall have a period of thirty (30) working days within which to inspect such Deliverable based upon the relevant Specification (an \"Acceptance Period\"). Should On2 find that any Deliverable does not substantially conform to the relevant Specification, On2 shall promptly so notify Wildform in writing, which notice shall provide sufficiently detailed explanation of the non-conformities so as to allow Wildform to reproduce them (any such notice is referred to herein as a \"Nonconformance Notice\"). Each of the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted by On2 unless On2 delivers to Wildform a Nonconformance Notice within thirty (30) business days of the delivery of such Deliverable. In the event that Wildform receives such Nonconformance Notice from On2, Wildform shall make commercially reasonable efforts to modify such Deliverable and re-deliver it to On2 after any such modification is completed. Each Deliverable shall be deemed to have been accepted by On2 when either (i) On2 notifies Wildform in writing of its acceptance of such Deliverables or (ii) On2 does not deliver a Nonconformance Notice to Wildform within the Acceptance Period. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, On2 shall not unreasonably withhold acceptance of any Deliverable.",

Subject to payment by On2 of the Closing Date Payment Amount in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, Wildform shall deliver each Product in accordance with the timeframe (the \"Timeframe\") set forth in Exhibit B, which Exhibit is made a part of this Agreement. On2 will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Wildform as necessary in completing the Development Work and delivery of the Products. Upon receipt of each Product, On2 shall have a period of thirty (30) working days within which to inspect such Product based upon the relevant Specification (an \"Acceptance Period\").

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, On2 shall not unreasonably withhold acceptance of any Product.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Deliverable' to 'Product' creates ambiguity. The contract primarily uses 'Deliverable', defined in 1.4, and Exhibit B lists the specific items as deliverables. Using 'Product' interchangeably, and leaving 'Deliverables' in other places, raises questions about whether the acceptance procedure applies equally to all items listed in Exhibit B or just the ones now called 'Product'. This creates potential enforcement disputes about quality standards.",

For purposes of the response times set forth below a \"Serious\" Program Error shall be defined as a Program Error that (a) causes the Deliverables to crash (malfunction), or (b) substantially degrades the performance, usability or appearance of the Deliverables.

                "explanation": "Changing 'Program Errors' to 'Software Defects' in the first sentence, while retaining 'Program Errors' throughout the rest of the section, creates confusion. It is unclear whether 'Software Defects' is intended to encompass all types of program errors or if it refers to a subset, potentially altering Wildform's support obligations. Since 'Software Defects' is not defined in the contract, it leads to disputes in identifying which errors are covered under the agreement.",

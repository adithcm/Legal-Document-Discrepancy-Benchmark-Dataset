                "explanation": "Changing 'First Amendment' to 'Initial Amendment' creates confusion. Is this truly the first amendment, or is 'Initial Amendment' a new concept distinct from subsequent amendments? The contract doesn't define 'Initial Amendment,' potentially invalidating later references to 'First Amendment'.",

Section 13.9 of the Development Agreement is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:   \"Notwithstanding the above, Bioamber may fund the BRI Project up until the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrates  the ability to produce succinic acid (or salts thereof) from any feedstock at a concentration of [***] grams/liter succinic acid (or salts thereof).  Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will  cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from  Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.   B. New Section 13.10 is added to the Development Agreement as set forth below:   \"13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber hereby  agreeing to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the  biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9  of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the  Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as  described above.\"",

                "explanation": "Changing \"require\" to \"mandate\" introduces a subtle but potentially significant shift in the strength of the obligation. 'Require' could be interpreted as a reasonable expectation, while 'mandate' suggests a stricter, non-negotiable directive. This semantic change creates uncertainty about the actual level of Bioamber's obligation regarding the use of unexpended funds.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'best efforts' with 'commercially reasonable efforts' and 'diligently work' introduces ambiguity. 'Best efforts' is a high standard, while 'commercially reasonable efforts' allows for consideration of economic factors. 'Diligently work' is vaguer than either. These changes weaken Bioamber's obligation and make it harder to enforce their regulatory approval and scale-up duties.",

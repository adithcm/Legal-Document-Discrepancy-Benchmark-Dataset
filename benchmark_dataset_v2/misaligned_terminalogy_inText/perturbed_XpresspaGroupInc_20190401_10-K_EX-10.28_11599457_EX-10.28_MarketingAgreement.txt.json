XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such commission be greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",

XSPA shall remit to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any bonus actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or associate(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such bonus be greater than ten percent (10%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",
                "explanation": "The term 'commission' has been replaced with 'bonus,' and 'contractor(s)' with 'associate(s).' The percentage limitation has been lowered from 15% to 10%. This change introduces ambiguity because 'commission' and 'bonus' have distinct legal meanings, and it's unclear which employees are now eligible, creating uncertainty in enforcement and potentially affecting the profitability calculation. In accounting terms, there is also a difference between 'pay' and 'remit.' 'Pay' implies a direct exchange whereas 'remit' indicates the sending of money to another place.",

XSPA shall permit such personnel access to each Store and the ability to assist in the marketing, promotion and sale of the Products.

Calm shall have the right, but not the obligation, to engage representatives of its choosing to be present in any Store(s) to assist in the display, marketing, promotion, offer for sale and sale of Products, provided, however, that no more than one such individual shall be present at any one time in any store without the prior written consent of XSPA. XSPA shall permit such representatives access to each Store and the ability to assist in the marketing, promotion and sale of the Products. For the avoidance of doubt, as between the Parties, Calm shall remain responsible for any payments or remuneration with respect to any such representatives.",
                "explanation": "The term 'personnel' has been replaced with 'representatives,' and 'employee compensation or other benefits' has been replaced with 'payments or remuneration'. This change introduces ambiguity, as the legal obligations differ for employees versus independent contractors ('representatives'). By changing the wording, it's unclear whether Calm is hiring employees or contractors, thus affecting XSPA's potential liability for workplace issues and affecting legal liabilities. Also, remuneration may not always indicate employee benefits, so this also creates ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Store' has been replaced with 'location', 'commercially reasonable efforts' with 'standard business practices', 'obtain and maintain approval' with 'receive and maintain endorsement', 'authorities' with 'agencies', 'entities' with 'establishments', 'approval is required' with 'validation is needed', 'as soon as practicable' with 'as quickly as possible', and 'maintain' with 'ensure exists'. These replacements significantly reduce the defined level of effort and obligation from XSPA in this section, as endorsement, validation, location, and agency are not as rigorous as their original counterparts.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Services' is replaced with 'Solutions'. 'Products and Services' offered by Leclanché are explicitly mentioned later in the agreement, whereas the introduction of 'Solutions' as an alternative may lead to confusion, especially if 'Solutions' is not clearly defined or distinguished from 'Services'. This creates ambiguity regarding Oak Ridge's responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "Leclanché shall supply the Goods and Assistance;\n\nLeclanché shall provide training and documentation;",
                "explanation": "Here, 'Products' is replaced with 'Goods', and 'Services' is replaced with 'Assistance'. The contract consistently refers to 'Products and Services'. Changing this to 'Goods and Assistance' creates uncertainty. Are 'Goods' the same as 'Products'? Is 'Assistance' equivalent to 'Services'? This internal inconsistency can cause disputes regarding Leclanché's obligations. The agreement specifies what Leclanché Products and Services are, so these terms have a specific meaning. Changing them to Goods and Assistance introduces ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Parties' is replaced with 'Companies'. The term 'Parties' is defined in the first section of the agreement as both Leclanche S.A. and Oak Ridge Energy Technologies Inc. By changing the terminology in this section, it may be argued that the term now has a different meaning and introduces ambiguity of who is meant to exclusively work with each other.",

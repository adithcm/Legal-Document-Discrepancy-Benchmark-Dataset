                "explanation": "The terms 'Supplier' and 'Vendor' are used seemingly interchangeably, which causes confusion as to the exact legal entity that is contracted to fulfill the obligations of the agreement.

This introduces potential ambiguity, especially if separate entities are acting as supplier and vendor at different stages. This contradicts the first perturbation, therefore, introduces a contradiction.",

                "original_text": "In consideration of the payments, through the issuance of securities to AJR as provided for in Section 3 hereof, AJR agrees to designate XC as an associate sponsor and the \"exclusive technology sponsor\" for wearable computer technology\" of the Team for the Season and grants to XC the rights and benefits of such sponsorship as more fully set forth herein.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the payments, through the issuance of securities to AJR as provided for in Section 3 hereof, AJR agrees to designate XC as an associate underwriter and the \"exclusive technology provider\" for wearable computer technology\" of the Team for the Season and grants to XC the rights and benefits of such sponsorship as more fully set forth herein.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'sponsor' to 'underwriter' and 'technology sponsor' to 'technology provider' creates ambiguity about XC's role. Is XC a financial backer, a technology supplier, or both? This introduces uncertainty in enforcement because the specific obligations associated with each role are different.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'best efforts' with 'reasonable efforts' lowers the required standard of performance and replacing 'products and services' with 'deliverables and activities' creates uncertainty about what AJR is obligated to promote. Changing 'shall assist' to 'may assist' makes it optional, causing a contradiction in AJR's obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'term' to 'duration' isn't problematic by itself, but changing the scheduled end date of the season from 'October 12, 2002' to 'November 12, 2002' causes a contradiction about when the agreement actually ends. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement because the time-dependent clauses will be unclear.",

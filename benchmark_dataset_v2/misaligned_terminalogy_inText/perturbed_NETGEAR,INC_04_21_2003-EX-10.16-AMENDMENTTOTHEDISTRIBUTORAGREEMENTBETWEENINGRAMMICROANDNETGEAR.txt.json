This contract, however, will be subject to the laws of Delaware regarding conflict of laws.",
                "explanation": "The agreement initially states that California law governs conflicts of law, but then it is changed to make the agreement also subject to Delaware law regarding conflict of laws, which introduces conflicting state law applications and creates uncertainty in legal interpretation.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' is changed to 'Reseller'. This creates ambiguity because the initial sentence refers to 'Distributor' and later sentences mentions products that will be offered to the 'Distributor', so this could affect the distribution and discount.",

This can lead to uncertainty, since Ingram is defined as acting on behalf of its affiliates, and the scope of the agreement might be uncertain, along with the geographic areas affected.",

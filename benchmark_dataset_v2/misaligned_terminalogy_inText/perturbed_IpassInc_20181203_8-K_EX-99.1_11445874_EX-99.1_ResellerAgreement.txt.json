Channel Partner acknowledges iPass as the primary, but not sole, vendor for all services within the scope of the Services outlined herein. Channel Partner may resell or otherwise provide the product to any third party for purposes of further \"down channel\" resale of the Services with explicit iPass approval.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'exclusive provider' is replaced with the term 'primary vendor' which is contradictory. In a separate sentence the language is changed allowing the channel partner to sell products to third parties without iPass notice or consent, which directly contradicts the original language.",

Should an End User communicate to Channel Partner or to iPass its dissatisfaction regarding the Services or related matters, the notified party shall promptly give notice to the other party, and iPass and Channel Partner shall work together in good faith to resolve the issue to End User's reasonable satisfaction. If in iPass' reasonable determination the issue is not resolved within thirty (30) days after Channel Partner's receipt of notice of End User's dissatisfaction, iPass may, in addition to other remedies available to iPass, revoke Channel Partner's appointment under Section 1.2 wholly or with respect to such End User and may refer such End User to another iPass channel partner or provide services directly to such End User without any liability to Channel Partner.",

Should a Client communicate to Channel Partner or to iPass its dissatisfaction regarding the Services or related matters, the notified party shall promptly give notice to the other party, but iPass has the sole discretion to resolve the issue. If in iPass' opinion the issue is not resolved within ninety (90) days after Channel Partner's receipt of notice of Client's dissatisfaction, iPass is not obligated to revoke Channel Partner's appointment under Section 1.2 wholly or with respect to such Client and may not refer such Client to another iPass channel partner or provide services directly to such Client without any liability to Channel Partner.",

This may cause confusion if they are considered different entities. Additionally, the change removes the 'reasonable satisfaction' clause, and the requirements to revoke the channel partner's appointment.",

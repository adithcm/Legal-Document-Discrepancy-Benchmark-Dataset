                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the signatories hereby confirm the understanding by and among them regarding the combined submission on their behalf of the Report on Form 13D and any subsequent modifications, concerning the instruments of the aforementioned institution, and that this Document shall be attached as an Appendix to such filing.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'undersigned' is replaced by 'signatories', 'agreement' by 'understanding', 'joint filing' by 'combined submission', 'Statement on Schedule 13D' by 'Report on Form 13D', 'amendments' by 'modifications', 'securities' by 'instruments', 'issuer' by 'institution', 'Agreement' by 'Document' and 'Exhibit' by 'Appendix'. The original paragraph establishes a formal agreement while the modified version refers to an informal 'understanding'. This weakens the legal enforceability of the filing requirement.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Agreement' is replaced by 'Document', 'executed' is replaced by 'signed', 'counterparts' is replaced by 'duplicates', 'original' is replaced by 'copy', and 'one and the same Agreement' is replaced by 'a complete set of copies'. The original text specifies that each counterpart is an original, carrying full legal weight. The modified version states that each duplicate is treated as a copy and is viewed as a complete set of copies, potentially weakening the legal weight of the signed document and leading to uncertainty about which version is the definitive one.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'COMPANY' is replaced by 'FIRM', 'adviser' by 'consultant', 'general partner' by 'main partner', and 'Authorized Signatory' by 'Official Representative'. While seeming minor, changing 'Company' to 'Firm' could imply a different legal structure, and substituting 'adviser' with 'consultant' may alter the scope of responsibilities. 'Authorized Signatory' to 'Official Representative' introduces ambiguity regarding the level of authority.",

                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Miltenyi will non-exclusively supply and sell to Bellicum or its Licensees or Subcontractors, and Bellicum or its Licensees or Subcontractors will purchase from Miltenyi, Miltenyi Products listed on Exhibit B solely for the Permitted Use (as defined below). Each Purchase Order placed under this Agreement shall be exclusively governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Quality Agreement, as amended from time to time, unless specifically otherwise agreed between the Parties in writing. Any terms and conditions of any Purchase Order or acknowledgement given or received which are additional to or inconsistent with this Agreement or the Quality Agreement shall have no effect and such terms and conditions are hereby excluded and rejected.",

                "explanation": "The change in 'Purchase Order' to 'Order' introduces ambiguity. 'Purchase Order' is a defined term, but 'Order' is not. This creates confusion about whether all orders are subject to the same terms, potentially undermining the formal purchase process outlined elsewhere.",

                "explanation": "The change in 'Bellicum Product' to 'Bellicum Therapeutic' introduces an undefined term. Throughout the contract 'Bellicum Product' is defined, whereas 'Bellicum Therapeutic' is not, and therefore adds uncertainty about whether Miltenyi has the same obligations for a Bellicum Therapeutic as a Bellicum Product.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Supply Failure\" to \"Production Interruption\" in the first sentence, but retaining 'Supply Failure' later in the same paragraph introduces a misaligned term. Given that 'Supply Failure' is defined in the same section and 'Production Interruption' is not, it can lead to misinterpretation and uncertainty, even though the contract never used the term \"Production Interruption\" before.",

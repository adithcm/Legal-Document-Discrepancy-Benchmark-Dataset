                "explanation": "The terms 'distributor' and 'vendor' are used interchangeably to refer to the same entity, but 'Products' is changed to 'Goods'. This introduces confusion as to whether the agreement applies to 'Products' as defined or some other type of 'Goods,' creating a contradiction.",

The reader cannot be sure what the responsibilities are with selling products, which could also be interpreted as services or other deliverables. In addition, it's not clear whether guidelines have the same level of authority as policies. These changes creates confusion as to what the distributor is expected to sell and follow.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'discount' is being replaced with 'rebate', 'Products' with 'Items' and 'Prices' with 'Tariffs'. This creates ambiguity because it is not specified in the contract whether a discount and rebate mean the same thing. Also, it's ambiguous as to what items the rebate applies to.",

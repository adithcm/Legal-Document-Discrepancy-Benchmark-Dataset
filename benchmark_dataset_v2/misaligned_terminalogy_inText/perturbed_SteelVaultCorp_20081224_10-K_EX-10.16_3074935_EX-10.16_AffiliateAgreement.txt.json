                "explanation": "Changing 'Marketing Affiliate' to 'Marketing Associate' introduces uncertainty about which entity is bound by the compliance requirements. Further, the term 'marketing practices' in 5.1 is changed to 'promotional activities'. The contract fails to clarify whether or not marketing practices are the same as promotional activities, potentially leading to confusion about what constitutes a violation.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Parties' is replaced with 'Vendors'.

The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",

                "explanation": "The term 'Minimum Annual Order Volume' (MAOV) is replaced with 'Minimum Annual Order Quantity' (MAOQ). The contract uses these terms interchangeably without defining if volume and quantity mean the same thing in this specific context. This creates ambiguity regarding whether Premier needs to meet a volume-based target, a quantity-based target, or both. The change from 'volume' to 'quantity' can change the obligations.",

                "explanation": "The term 'covenants' is replaced with 'obligations'. While seemingly similar, covenants are specific types of promises in a contract. By using 'obligations' instead, it becomes unclear if specific covenants within the original agreement are still considered legally binding covenants or just general obligations. This could weaken the enforceability of certain sections of the contract.",

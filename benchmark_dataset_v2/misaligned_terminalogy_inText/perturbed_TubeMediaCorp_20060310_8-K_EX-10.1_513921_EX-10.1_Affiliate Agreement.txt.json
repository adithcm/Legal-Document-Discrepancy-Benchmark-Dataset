                "original_text": "(a) Network hereby grants to Affiliate the exclusive right via Broadcast Television, and Affiliate hereby accepts such exclusive right and the obligation during the Term to broadcast the Service via Broadcast Television (i) over the transmission facilities of each Station identified on Exhibit A, which is licensed by the FCC to serve the community for each such Station (the \"Licensed Community\"), for receipt by TV Households in the DMA in which the Licensed Community is located, as such DMA is identified on Exhibit A, and (ii) over the transmission facilities of any Acquired Station, except to the extent that, as of the date Affiliate notifies Network in writing of its binding agreement to acquire such Acquired Station, (A) another Broadcast Television station in the same DMA as the Acquired Station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service, or (B) the Acquired Station is obligated to broadcast other material that precludes it from also carrying the Service.",

                "explanation": "The term \"exclusive right\" is replaced with \"non-exclusive right.\" This creates a contradiction because later sections assume Affiliate has exclusive rights, potentially leading to disputes about Network's ability to license the Service to others in the same DMA. It also contradicts with section 3(d).",

Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Network shall not distribute or authorize third parties to distribute the Service to subscribers by any technology (other than Broadcast Television and transmission by an MVPD), on an interactive, time-delayed (other than multiple time-zone feeds of the Service), \"video-on-demand\" or similar basis, as an audio-only service (e.g., radio) or over the Internet.",

                "explanation": "The phrase \"Network shall not have the right to distribute\" is replaced by \"Network shall retain the right to distribute\". Also \"Network shall not authorize third parties\" becomes \"Network shall authorize third parties\" This directly contradicts the preceding clause regarding Affiliate's rights, leading to confusion over who controls distribution rights in the DMA. Contradicts with section 3(a) as well.",

Affiliate shall retain the right to elect not to transmit any programming on the Service over the broadcast facilities of a Station if Affiliate reasonably believes that such programming is unsatisfactory or unsuitable or contrary to the public interest, or in order to substitute a program which, in Affiliate's judgment, is of greater local or national importance.

                "explanation": "The phrase \"Affiliate shall retain the right\" is replaced by \"Affiliate shall not retain the right\". This creates a direct contradiction regarding Affiliate's control over programming, especially concerning preemptions. Contradicts section 4(a).",

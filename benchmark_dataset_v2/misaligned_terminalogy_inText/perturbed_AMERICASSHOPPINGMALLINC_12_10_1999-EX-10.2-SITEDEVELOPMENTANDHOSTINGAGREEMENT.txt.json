As used in this Agreement, \"Deerskin Products\" shall not include (i) closeout merchandise which the Company may identify as \"Deerskin\" branded items, if such is the case, nor (ii) products from the Company's Joan Cook Catalog.",

As used in this Agreement, \"Deerskin Products\" shall not include (i) closeout merchandise which the Company may identify as \"Deerskin\" branded items, if such is the case, nor (ii) products from the Company's Joan Cook Catalog.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Site' to 'Webpage' and 'Deerskin Products' to 'Merchandise' in this section, while leaving the definition of 'Deerskin Products' unchanged, creates a conflict. It's now unclear if 'Webpage' is the same as 'Site' or if 'Merchandise' exclusively refers to 'Deerskin Products' as previously defined. This introduces uncertainty in the scope of HDI's responsibilities.",

No portion of the Webpage shall be made available on the Internet without the consent of the Company.",
                "explanation": "Using 'Webpage,' 'Website,' 'Internet Presence,' and 'Platform' interchangeably without defining them against the already defined 'Site' causes confusion. The Company's control, approval, and consent are now ambiguously linked to these different terms, making it difficult to determine the extent of their authority over the online presence.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Net Sales' to 'Gross Revenue' but keeping the definition as 'Net Sales' creates a direct contradiction. It becomes unclear which metric the 30% is based on, leading to potential disputes over payments. This is further exacerbated by not defining Gross Revenue.",

                "changed_text": "1.3  \"Control\" or \"Controlled\" means, with respect to Intellectual Property, that SpinCo or a member of the SpinCo Group possesses such Intellectual Property, in whole or in part, and/or has the authority to allow Parent access to such Intellectual Property as set forth herein and without incurring any financial or other obligations to any other Person, subject, in each case, to the terms of any license or other agreement to which SpinCo or any of the SpinCo Group is a party that relates to any such Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'owns' and 'has the right to grant a license' have been changed to 'possesses' and 'authority to allow access'. This weakens SpinCo's rights over the Intellectual Property. 'Possesses' doesn't necessarily imply legal ownership. The phrase 'authority to allow access' is vague and does not give the same legal standing or rights as 'right to grant a license'.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby provides to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to provide to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, temporal, revocable, partially paid-up, royalty-bearing right and permission, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The foregoing permission shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP.

                "explanation": "The terms related to the license are changed. 'License grant' is now 'permission granted'; 'perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right' becomes 'temporal, revocable, partially paid-up, royalty-bearing right'. These changes drastically alter the nature of the agreement, making it far less favorable to Parent. This introduces uncertainty about the stability and cost of using the IP.",

Subject to subsections (i)-(iii) of this Section 5.1(a), each Party agrees that prior to the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time (\"Delivery Date\"), it will deliver possession of any Tangible/Intangible Information of the other Party that is in its possession or control to the other Party, without retaining any copies.",

Subject to subsections (i)-(iii) of this Section 5.1(a), each Party agrees that prior to the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time (\"Delivery Date\"), it will display the Tangible/Intangible Information of the other Party that is in its area or influence to the other Party, keeping duplicates.",
                "explanation": "The terms of information are changed from 'Agreement for Transfer and Exchange of Information' to 'Understanding for Temporary Exchange of Data'. 'Own' is changed to 'access' and 'entitled to physical possession' to 'allowed to view'. 'Deliver possession' is replaced with 'display' and 'without retaining any copies' to 'keeping duplicates.' These changes reduce the legal obligation to transfer data, and instead makes it an 'understanding' for data display, not a legally binding transfer.",

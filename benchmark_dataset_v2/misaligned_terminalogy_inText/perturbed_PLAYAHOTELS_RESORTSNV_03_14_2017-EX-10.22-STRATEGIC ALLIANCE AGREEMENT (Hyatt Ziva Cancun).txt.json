                "original_text": "If the Offering Party is required to offer the Receiving Party a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Offering Party must deliver written notice to the Receiving Party, together with reasonable due diligence information in the Offering Party's possession to enable the Receiving Party to evaluate the Development Opportunity (collectively, the \"Offer Notice\"). The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "changed_text": "If the Initiating Party is required to offer the Receiving Entity a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Initiating Party must deliver written notice to the Receiving Entity, together with reasonable due diligence information in the Initiating Party's possession to enable the Receiving Entity to evaluate the Development Opportunity (collectively, the \"Project Proposal\"). The Receiving Entity will have fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving the Project Proposal to notify the Initiating Party whether the Receiving Entity exercises its right of first consideration for that Development Opportunity.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Offering Party' and 'Receiving Party' are replaced with 'Initiating Party' and 'Receiving Entity' respectively without defining if they refer to the same entities. The term 'Offer Notice' is replaced with 'Project Proposal,' and the response period is changed from 10 business days to 15 calendar days. This creates confusion regarding who has the obligation and what timeline applies, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "original_text": "Any notice required under this Agreement to be given by either Party to the other Party shall be in writing in the English language. Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "changed_text": "Any communication mandated by this contract from either Participant to the counterparty must be submitted in written form using the English language. These communications will be deemed valid upon receipt and confirmation through email correspondence, replacing traditional mail or courier services. An acknowledgment email will serve as definitive proof of transmission.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Party' and 'other Party' are replaced with 'Participant' and 'counterparty.' The method and timing of notice are changed from international courier with a two-business-day effectiveness to immediate effectiveness upon email receipt. This creates uncertainty about which notification method and timeline are legally binding.",

                "changed_text": "Upon initiating this Strategic Alliance Agreement, Playa, along with Hyatt, mutually recognize that neither entity has presented the counterpart with any declarations concerning anticipated revenue, prospective achievement, or analogous considerations relevant to the commercial undertaking outlined within. Moreover, both Playa and Hyatt mutually comprehend that the Partner does not ensure or warrant a minimum income or financial performance.",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'Hyatt and Playa' with 'entity', 'counterpart', and 'Partner' for inconsistency. Replaced 'Agreement' with 'Strategic Alliance Agreement' for a section of the text, and then with 'commercial undertaking' in another part. Added the phrase 'the Partner does not ensure or warrant a minimum income or financial performance' that leads to an in-text contradiction.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The parties hereby consent to jointly prepare and submit to the relevant governing bodies this Form 13G or Form 13D and all subsequent changes reporting each of the parties' interest in shares of the entity specified herein, and hereby confirm that such Form 13G or Form 13D is being submitted on behalf of each of the parties pursuant to and in compliance with the requirements of Regulation 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'undersigned' and 'parties' are used interchangeably, but it is not explicitly stated that they refer to the same entities. 'Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D' is also changed to 'Form 13G or Form 13D', and 'Rule 13d-1(k)' is changed to 'Regulation 13d-1(k)'. This introduces uncertainty regarding who is bound by the agreement and the specific regulatory requirements, even though they effectively mean the same thing in context. The choice of using \"consent\" and \"submit\" vs. \"agree\" and \"file\" add to the potential confusion.",

                "changed_text": "The participants acknowledge that each will ensure the prompt submission of said revisions, and for the correctness and precision of the data related to him, her, or it incorporated therein, but will not guarantee the correctness and precision of the data related to the others, unless he, she, or it is aware or has justification to assume that said data is flawed.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'undersigned' and 'participants' are used interchangeably. 'Responsible for the timely filing' is changed to 'ensure the prompt submission', and 'completeness and accuracy' is changed to 'correctness and precision'. 'Knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate' is changed to 'is aware or has justification to assume that said data is flawed'. This shift in terminology introduces ambiguity regarding the level of liability and the standard of care required for ensuring the accuracy of information. It creates confusion as to whether 'responsible' and 'ensure' are the same legal burden.",

                "changed_text": "Effective as of: March 27, 2020.",
                "explanation": "Changing “Dated:” to “Effective as of:” introduces a subtle yet potentially significant contradiction. 'Dated' typically refers to the date the agreement was signed, while 'Effective as of' indicates the date from which the agreement's terms are legally binding. While they often coincide, they don't have to. This creates uncertainty as to when the obligations under the agreement actually begin, which could impact timelines for filing and other responsibilities.",

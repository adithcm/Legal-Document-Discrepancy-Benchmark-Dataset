Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",

Each Seller acknowledges that this understanding is suggestive with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") signifies the potential, directly or indirectly, to guide or influence the direction of the management and guidelines of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'agrees' is replaced with 'acknowledges' turning the binding contract into a mere acknowledgement, where the language 'shall not' becomes 'may choose not to' introducing ambiguity as to whether the seller is actually prohibited from competing. Also replaced synonymous terms such as 'business' to 'venture' 'competes' to 'vies' 'owner' to 'possessor' 'person' to 'entity' to create ambiguity on the scope. Similarly, 'covenant' becomes 'understanding' and 'reasonable' becomes 'suggestive' weakening the clause.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be prohibited from (1) requesting for engagement or employing past personnel of Buyer or the Company (including their respective branches) whose engagement was ended by Buyer or the Company (including their respective branches) at least six months prior to such initial request by such Seller or (2) requesting workforce of the Combined Business by means of a broad invitation through a public means or general or widespread mailing that is not specially aimed at workforce or former",

Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement. If any action or proceeding shall be commenced to enforce this Agreement or any right arising in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party the reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred by such prevailing party in connection with such action or proceeding.",

Each Seller suggests that in the event of a violation of this Understanding, the harm to Buyer might be immeasurable and that consequently any recourse at Law or in financial compensations might be insufficient. Accordingly, the parties imply that Buyer may, in addition to financial compensations sustained by reason of any such infraction or prospective infraction, without the necessity of filing any security or similar device (and Sellers hereby tentatively set aside any entitlement they might possess to demand the securing, providing or filing of any such security or similar device) be permitted to pursue equitable measures (including explicit fulfillment) against the Sellers for violation of this Understanding. If any action or process shall be started to apply this Understanding or any entitlement arising in connection with this Understanding, the successful participant in such action or process may reclaim from the other participant the fitting legal costs, expenditures and charges sustained by such successful participant in connection with such action or process.",

Also replaced 'agrees' with 'suggests/implies' and 'waive' with 'tentatively set aside' to weaken the clause. Changed 'specific performance' to 'explicit fulfillment', 'action or proceeding' to 'action or process', and 'prevailing party' to 'successful participant'. These changes undermine the clarity and enforceability of the clause, making it difficult to determine the exact remedies and cost recovery available to the buyer.",

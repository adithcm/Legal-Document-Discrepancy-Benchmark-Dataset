Promote, market and introduce the Items to prospective clients in the government space nationwide.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'lead finder' to 'lead generator' implies a more active role, while weakening 'best efforts' to 'commercially reasonable efforts' lowers the standard of performance. Changing 'Products' to 'Items' creates confusion about what is being promoted.",

Provide reasonably prompt responses to both technical and administrative queries posed by Bravatek.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'best efforts' to 'commercially acceptable efforts' significantly reduces the required level of effort. 'Lead finding' becomes 'lead generation', which conflicts with Bravatek's modified role. Changing 'alliance partner' to 'associate' diminishes the relationship, while 'customers' become 'clients'. 'Timely' becomes 'reasonably prompt', creating ambiguity. 'Questions' becomes 'queries'.",

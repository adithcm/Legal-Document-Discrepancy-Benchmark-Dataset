If only a portion of the Product Build is available for shipment to meet the ex-factory date, IAC will notify Sonos and ship the available Products unless otherwise directed by Sonos. In the event that such delay is solely caused by IAC (an \"IAC Delay\"), IAC shall notify Sonos in writing [*] in advance of the change and provide a recovery plan within [*]. If the IAC Delay causes Products to ship more than [*] from the original ex-factory date, IAC shall pay for any resulting increase in the freight cost over that which Sonos would have been required to pay by the standard shipment method.",

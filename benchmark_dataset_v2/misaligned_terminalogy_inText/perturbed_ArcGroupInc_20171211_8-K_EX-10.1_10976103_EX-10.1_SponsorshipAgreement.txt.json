                "original_text": "This Sponsorship Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is entered into as of November 27, 2017 (the \"Execution Date\") by and between Jacksonville Jaguars, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Club\"), and The ARC Group, Inc., a Florida corporation (owner and operator of Dick's Wings and Grill) (\"Sponsor\").",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Agreement' to 'Contract' and 'Sponsor' to 'Vendor' creates ambiguity. While seemingly synonymous, legal documents rely on precise definitions. Using these terms interchangeably without explicit definition introduces uncertainty, especially in clauses referring specifically to rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Sponsor' is replaced with 'Vendor,' 'Annual Fee' with 'Yearly Cost,' 'Contract Year' with 'Term Year,' and 'Agreement' with 'Contract.' This creates potential conflict because these terms are now being used interchangeably without being explicitly defined as the same thing. This could lead to disputes about what the payments actually represent and when they are due.",

In the event of any recall with respect to Sponsor's products provided to the Concessionaire pursuant to this Agreement or the Concessions Agreement, Sponsor shall notify both Club and the Concessionaire immediately upon issuance of such recall, and Club may, at its sole discretion and without penalty, suspend the Benefits for a duration as reasonably determined by Club.",

In the event of any recall with respect to Distributor's products provided to the Concessionaire pursuant to this Contract or the Concessions Contract, Distributor shall notify both Club and the Concessionaire immediately upon issuance of such recall, and Club may, at its sole discretion and without penalty, suspend the Advantages for a duration as reasonably determined by Club.",
                "explanation": "Switching 'Sponsor' to 'Vendor' and then to 'Distributor', 'Agreement' to 'Contract' and then to 'Concessions Contract', and finally 'Benefits' to 'Advantages' introduces doubt about who bears the ultimate responsibility for product recalls and what exactly can be suspended as a result. If Distributor and Vendor are different entities, then enforcing this clause becomes problematic.",

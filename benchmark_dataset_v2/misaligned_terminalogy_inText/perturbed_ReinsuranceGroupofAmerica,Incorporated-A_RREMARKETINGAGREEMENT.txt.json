                "original_text": "Section 1. Appointment and Obligations of the Remarketing Agent. (a) The Company and the Trust (together, the \"Issuers\") hereby appoint  Barclays as exclusive remarketing agent (the \"Remarketing Agent\"), and Barclays hereby accepts appointment as Remarketing Agent, for the  purpose of (i) remarketing the Remarketing Securities on behalf of the holders thereof and (ii) performing such other duties as are assigned to the  Remarketing Agent in the Remarketing Procedures, all in accordance with and pursuant to the Remarketing Procedures.",

(a) The Company and the Trust (together, the \"Issuers\") hereby appoint  Barclays as exclusive reseller (the \"Remarketing Agent\"), and Barclays hereby accepts appointment as Remarketing Agent, for the  purpose of (i) remarketing the Remarketing Securities on behalf of the holders thereof and (ii) performing such other duties as are assigned to the  Remarketing Agent in the Remarketing Procedures, all in accordance with and pursuant to the Remarketing Procedures.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"remarketing agent\" to \"reseller\" introduces inconsistency. The document defines Barclays as the 'Remarketing Agent,' but then uses 'reseller' in Section 1(a). This creates ambiguity, as it's unclear if 'reseller' is synonymous with 'Remarketing Agent' or refers to a different role, which affects their obligations.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"Remarketing\" with \"trade\" introduces inconsistency. The document frequently refers to the process as \"Remarketing\". Replacing this with 'trade' suggests an alternative or different type of event, leading to uncertainty about which actions constitute a successful event triggering payment.",

The  Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or  made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder  of Remarketing Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a  Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its  part. The Remarketing Agent will be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination by the Calculation Agent under the Calculation Agency  Agreement, dated as of December 18, 2001 between the Company and Reinsel & Company LLP, as Calculation Agent, of the Accreted Value or  Discount relating to the Preferred Securities and Debentures, as applicable, and will incur no liability to the Company or any holder of Remarketing  Securities relating to inaccuracies in calculating such Accreted Value or Discount.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Remarketing Agent\" to \"Reseller\" in the title of section 10, while maintaining \"Remarketing Agent\" throughout the rest of the section, creates internal inconsistency and raises questions on which entity, is bound by the duties and standard of care outlined. This can lead to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Project' is defined in Article I. By using 'Venture' interchangeably, it introduces ambiguity as to whether 'Venture' has the same meaning as a 'Project,' thus creating uncertainty in obligations. 'Project' is used throughout the document, and randomly interchanging it with 'Venture' obfuscates the intended meaning.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Project' is randomly replaced with 'Initiative' at the start of the section, while the rest of the section still refers to 'Project'. This creates a conflict in which undertaking the two companies are collaborating on because 'Initiative' and 'Project' are undefined as similar.",

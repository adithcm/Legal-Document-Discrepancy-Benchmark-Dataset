                "explanation": "The original text specifies the need for a 'Restaurant Manager,' implying a specific role and potentially specific qualifications. The modified version uses the term 'restaurant staff,' broadening the scope and potentially allowing the Franchisee to fulfill the requirement with any personnel, thus undermining the quality expectations implied by the original term.",

The  Franchisee  agrees  to display approved signage conforming to a reasonably current image. The Franchisee may maintain usage of signs that have not been updated without written approval from BKC.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'Signs' and enforce that The Franchisee should follow BKC and its Current Image. The modified version is changing it to Signage giving Franchisee more leeway to do as they 'deem' best. The franchisee also does not need any approval to use old signs, conflicting with the earlier term.",

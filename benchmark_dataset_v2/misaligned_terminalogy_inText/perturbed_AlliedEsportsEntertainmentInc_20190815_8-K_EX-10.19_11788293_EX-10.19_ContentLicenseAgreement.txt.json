This Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (\"Renewal Term\") provided WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term. The Initial Term and any such Renewal Term are collectively referred to as the \"Term.\"",

This Agreement may extend for an additional two (2) years on different terms if WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term. The Initial Term and any such extension are collectively referred to as the \"Period.\"",
                "explanation": "The term 'Term' is changed to 'Period,' and the automatic renewal on the same terms is changed to a 'may extend' on 'different terms.' This creates confusion about the length of the agreement and the conditions for extension, contradicting the original clarity and enforceability of the duration.",

Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term.

Zynga shall not be required to remit the Consideration to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously delivered to WPT during the Period. Conversely, Zynga retains the right to modify Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Consideration previously delivered to WPT during the Period.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Royalty' is changed to 'Consideration,' 'Net Revenue' is changed to 'Net Proceeds (as interpreted by Zynga's accounting department)', 'pay' changed to 'remit/deliver,' and 'Term' is changed to 'Period.' Furthermore, Zynga gains the 'right to modify' annual payments, creating contradictions in payment calculations and obligations, and undermines the previously agreed-upon financial terms.",

                "explanation": "The term 'liability insurance' is changed to 'business insurance,' and the obligatory 'agrees to carry sufficient insurance' is changed to 'may maintain insurance at its discretion'. This introduces ambiguity and internal contradiction as the degree and scope of insurance is undefined, making it uncertain if the risks are adequately covered as intended in the original agreement.",

HERC shall not take any action that would harm or jeopardize the licensed HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks or HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks. HERC shall assist in such actions to the extent required and requested by HSI for establishing use of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI HERC Foreign ERB Trademarks and HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks during the Interim Period.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates HSI shall take all necessary actions to preserve and protect the trademarks and HERC shall be responsible for reimbursing all costs. The modified version changes 'shall' to 'may' for HSI's actions, introduces 'might' and 'potentially' making the action optional. It also introduces ambiguity to HERC's responsibilities, replacing 'shall' with 'may' and adding constraints on reimbursement obligations, which contradicts the original definitive obligations.",

HERC shall promptly notify HSI of the use of any mark by any third party which HERC considers might be an infringement or passing off of any HERTZ or HERTZ-formative intellectual property used by or licensed to HERC pursuant 6 to the terms hereof or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement. However, HSI shall have the sole right to decide whether or not proceedings shall be brought against such third parties. In the event that HSI decides that action should be taken against such third parties, HSI may take such action either in its own name or, alternatively, HSI may authorize HERC to initiate such action in HERC's name. In any event, the Parties agree to cooperate fully with each other to the extent necessary to prosecute such action, all expenses being borne by the Party bringing such action and all damages which may be recovered being solely for the account of that Party.",
                "changed_text": "5. Infringement and Indemnification. 5.1 Notice of Infringement. HERC should consider notifying HSI of the use of any mark by a third party if HERC subjectively believes it could be a violation of any HERTZ intellectual asset used by or licensed to HERC. HSI can evaluate the concern raised by HERC, and HSI has the option to decide if legal proceedings are advisable. If HSI determines action might be suitable, HSI can pursue legal options in its capacity, or perhaps allow HERC to initiate proceedings. The Parties might cooperate as needed, but expenses are the responsibility of the involved party, and damages would accrue solely to the account of that involved party.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a duty for HERC ('shall promptly notify') and a clear process. The modified version weakens HERC's obligation to 'should consider notifying' if it 'subjectively believes', and replaces definitive terms like 'infringement' with more ambiguous terms like 'violation' and 'intellectual asset'. HSI's right is changed from 'sole right' to 'option', and the parties' cooperation is now conditional ('might cooperate').",

In the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may notify HERC of such material breach and terminate this Agreement upon written notice. If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",

If a potential breach of this Agreement or supporting documents occurs, THC or HSI could notify HERC of a suspected breach and consider terminating this Agreement after informing HERC.

The modified version changes 'material breach' to 'potential breach' and inserts 'suspected', replacing a definite right ('may terminate') with a conditional one ('could notify' and 'consider terminating'). It introduces a dispute mechanism ('disputes the breach within a reasonable time frame') that removes the 'automatic termination', and makes the agreement 'subject to immediate dissolution', creating uncertainty.",

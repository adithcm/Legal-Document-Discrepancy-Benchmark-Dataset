                "explanation": "The terms 'licensed' and 'allowed' are used to describe HERC's use of trademarks, which creates confusion as to whether HERC has a formal license or simply permission to use the trademarks. 'Licensed' implies a stronger, contractually defined right, whereas 'allowed' suggests a more permissive, potentially revocable arrangement, creating uncertainty in the enforceability of HERC's rights.",

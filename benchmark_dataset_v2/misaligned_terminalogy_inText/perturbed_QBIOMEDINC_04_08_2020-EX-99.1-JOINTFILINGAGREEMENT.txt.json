                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. is, and any amendment thereto signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The filers hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. may be filed on behalf of each of the filers pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Amendments signed by each of the filers will be considered for filing, but filing is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'undersigned' to 'filers' introduces a different term for the same entity. The change from 'shall be filed' to 'may be filed' and adding 'but filing is not guaranteed' creates ambiguity and contradicts the initial agreement, impacting enforcement by making the filing discretionary rather than mandatory.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",
                "changed_text": "Each participant acknowledges that they are encouraged to assist with the filing of amendments, and are generally accountable for the accuracy of the information they provide, but are not held responsible for the thoroughness of information provided by other participants.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'undersigned' with 'participant', 'responsible' with 'encouraged to assist' and 'generally accountable' creates ambiguity about the level of responsibility. Changing 'completeness and accuracy' to 'thoroughness' also changes the nature of the responsibility, making it less definitive and impacting enforcement by weakening the obligation for timely and accurate filings. The original text asserts a direct responsibility, while the modified text suggests a more advisory role.",

                "changed_text": "This Filing Arrangement may be executed in multiple copies, and all copies combined should serve as a reference.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Joint Filing Agreement' to 'Filing Arrangement' suggests a less formal agreement. Replacing 'counterparts' with 'copies' and 'one and the same instrument' with 'serve as a reference' significantly weakens the binding nature of the agreement, potentially impacting enforcement by making it unclear whether all parties are bound by the same terms or if the 'reference' is optional.",

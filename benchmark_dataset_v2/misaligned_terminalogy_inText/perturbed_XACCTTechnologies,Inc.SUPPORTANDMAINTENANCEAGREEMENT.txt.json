                "original_text": "1.5      \"Product Maintenance\" means the Product updates and revisions that are          available from XACCT and selected by Licensee, as further referenced          herein and the attachments hereto as may be amended from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "1.5      \"Product Maintenance\" means only the Product updates and revisions that are available from XACCT. The specific items included in Product Maintenance are subject to change at XACCT's discretion without notice to Licensee, as further referenced          herein and the attachments hereto as may be amended from time to time.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Product Maintenance\" implies that Licensee has some selection in what is included. The modified definition removes Licensee's selection and grants XACCT sole discretion to modify what is part of Product Maintenance at any time without notification, which might cause confusion.",

                "explanation": "The original text commits XACCT to 'reasonable commercial efforts' and sets forth specific response times. The revised text changes the 'reasonable commercial efforts' to 'attempt' and specifies that the response times are not guaranteed creating uncertainty on XACCT's responsibility and enforcement.",

The Agreement will be automatically          renewed for additional one (1) year terms (subject to applicable fee          adjustments) unless thirty (30) days prior to the anniversary of the          Effective Date Licensee gives written notice to XACCT of its intention          not to renew.",

The Agreement may be renewed for additional one (1) year terms (subject to applicable fee adjustments) upon mutual agreement of both parties.  XACCT may, at its sole discretion, decide not to renew the agreement with or without giving the Licensee the thirty (30) days prior written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic renewal unless Licensee provides notice. The modified version turns renewal into a matter of mutual agreement with the additional ability for XACCT to decide on a renewal, which creates an imbalance and makes the terms vague.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Franchised Businesses\" to \"Pizza Outlets\" introduces ambiguity. The document later refers exclusively to 'Franchised Businesses,' creating confusion about whether the restrictions apply to all 'Pizza Outlets' or only those specifically defined as 'Franchised Businesses.' The replacement of the term 'Member' with 'Personnel' when referring to the employee who is party to the non-disclosure agreement introduces a similar confusion, as the document will later only use the term 'Member.'",

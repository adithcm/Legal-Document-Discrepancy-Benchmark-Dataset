                "explanation": "Changing \"Repairer\" to \"Service Provider\" creates ambiguity. While ATR is still defined, the contract uses \"Repairer\" elsewhere. It's now unclear if \"Repairer\" and \"Service Provider\" have the same meaning and creates uncertainty regarding which obligations each party is binded to. Throughout the contract, the term “Repairer” is used, therefore the term “Service Provider” can be viewed as something completely different which is not clearly defined.",

If vendor isn't mentioned, it's uncertain if \"Vendor\" and \"Repairer\" refer to the same entity, leading to conflicting obligations regarding who is responsible for the update and invoicing process. The duties between the Service Provider and Company become misaligned.",

Since \"Repairer\" has already been changed to \"Service Provider\", replacing \"Repairer\" with ATR blurs the lines as to who owns the IP. If the “Service Provider” and “ATR” are not one in the same, there will be a conflict of intellectual rights.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Distributor' to 'Supplier' introduces uncertainty. Later sections refer to 'Distributor', and it is not explicitly stated that 'Supplier' and 'Distributor' are the same, potentially creating confusion regarding obligations and rights.",

                "explanation": "Using 'Supplier' and then switching back to 'Distributor' in the same sentence introduces ambiguity. Does 'Distributor' here still refer to Ingram Micro, or some other entity? The changed text modifies the original text by using the terms 'supplier' and 'distributor' interchangeably. This creates uncertainty about whether both terms refer to the same business entity.",

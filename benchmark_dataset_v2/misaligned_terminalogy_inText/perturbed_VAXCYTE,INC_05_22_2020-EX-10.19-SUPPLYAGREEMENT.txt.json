                "explanation": "The original text uses 'agree' indicating a mutual agreement. The modified version replaced 'agree' with 'consent' that introduces ambiguity about the level of commitment and enforceability. Consent can be withdrawn or given conditionally, creating uncertainty in the binding nature of the agreement.",

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Supply Agreement, Sutro agrees that it will Manufacture the Product(s) at the Facility(ies) for SutroVax and shall supply the Product(s) to SutroVax, its Affiliates, and any SutroVax CMO, for purposes of production of Vaccine Compositions (including development of processes for the production of Vaccine Compositions), solely for non-clinical research purposes or in Phase I or Phase II clinical trials of such Vaccine Compositions..",

                "explanation": "Replaced 'agrees that it will supply' with 'acknowledges that it will furnish', which weakens Sutro's obligation. 'Acknowledges' suggests awareness but not necessarily a binding commitment to 'furnish'. This weakens obligation to deliver.",

Sutro shall not make any changes to the Specifications, processes, Facilities, raw materials, raw material suppliers or any other item that would affect the Manufacturing activities related to the Product (a \"Manufacturing Change\") that (a) would require a change to the applicable Drug Master File, (b) would be reasonably expected to cause SutroVax to be materially delayed obtaining any Regulatory Approval with respect to Vaccine Compositions or (c) causes the Product to not meet the Specification therefor (including the Activity Test with respect to Extract); without SutroVax's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delated). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sutro shall promptly make and implement such changes as are required by Applicable Law provided that, prior to implementation, Sutro shall provide notice thereof to SutroVax and confer with SutroVax with respect to its timelines, estimated effect on Price and other issues regarding such implementation. Sutro shall provide SutroVax at least [***] days' written notice prior to implementing any Manufacturing Change. Sutro shall not make any change to the Specification for a Product without SutroVax's prior written consent. In addition, SutroVax shall have the right to request changes in or modifications to the Specifications and Sutro will consider in good faith any such requested changes or modifications. All such changes or modifications shall be documented in writing and shall be signed by an authorized representative of SutroVax and Sutro. If such changes or modifications result in a material change in Sutro's Manufacturing costs or lead times, the Parties shall agree upon an appropriate adjustment to the Price or in the delivery schedules, as the case may be, for Product(s) to be provided by Sutro hereunder. Sutro shall promptly implement any agreed upon changes to the Specifications.",

Sutro should not make any changes to the Specifications, processes, Facilities, raw materials, raw material providers or any other item that would affect the Manufacturing activities related to the Product (a \"Manufacturing Change\") that (a) would require a change to the applicable Drug Master File, (b) would be reasonably expected to cause SutroVax to be materially delayed obtaining any Regulatory Approval with respect to Vaccine Compositions or (c) causes the Product to not meet the Specification therefor (including the Activity Test with respect to Extract); without SutroVax's prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delated).

If such changes or modifications result in a material change in Sutro's Manufacturing costs or lead times, the Parties may discuss an appropriate adjustment to the Price or in the delivery schedules, as the case may be, for Product(s) to be provided by Sutro hereunder. Sutro shall then implement any proposed changes to the Specifications.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce several contradictions. 'Shall not make any changes' is changed to 'should not make any changes', weakening the obligation. 'Prior written consent' becomes 'prior written approval,' implying approval is not as strong a requirement as consent. The shift from 'providers' to 'suppliers' is another instance of misaligned terminology. Furthermore, 'request changes' is changed to 'propose changes,' weakening the right of SutroVax to effect alterations to the specifications. The language on price changes is now 'may discuss', and 'shall' is replaced with 'then' on implementation, resulting in a weaker obligation.",

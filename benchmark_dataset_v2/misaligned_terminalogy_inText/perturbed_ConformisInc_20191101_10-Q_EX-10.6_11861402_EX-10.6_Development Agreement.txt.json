                "explanation": "The terms “Invention” and “Technology” are used interchangeably, without clear distinction, to define 'KIB Product IP'. It's unclear if 'Invention' is narrower or broader than 'Technology', leading to uncertainty regarding the scope of IP covered, since 'Technology' is not explicitly defined. This creates an internal contradiction since the definition of 'Invention' is present, but using a new similar term can introduce confusion.",

The term of this Agreement shall begin as of the Effective Date and continue until Acceptance of all Deliverables\nfor Milestones #1 and #2 pursuant to Section 3.4 and completion of Milestone #3, unless earlier terminated under Section 8.2, as\nprovided for under the Other Agreements, or as mutually agreed by the Parties.",

The term of this Agreement shall begin as of the Effective Date and continue until Approval of all Deliverables\nfor Milestones #1 and #2 pursuant to Section 3.4 and completion of Milestone #3, unless earlier terminated under Section 8.2, as\nprovided for under the Other Agreements, or as mutually agreed by the Parties.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Acceptance' is replaced by 'Approval.' While seemingly similar, the contract explicitly defines 'Acceptance' in Section 3.4, linking it to specific criteria and processes. Replacing it with 'Approval,' which is undefined, creates uncertainty about what constitutes the fulfillment of the term requirements, hence affecting the contract's duration. This also creates an internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'material information' is replaced by 'relevant data', and the term 'electronic form' is replaced by 'digital form.' Although seemingly similar, the term 'material information' is a legal term of art, whereas 'relevant data' is much more ambiguous. In addition, the term 'standard' is changed to 'established,' which affects how the obligations would be assessed. The term change can introduce confusion to what is considered the requirements of the provision.",

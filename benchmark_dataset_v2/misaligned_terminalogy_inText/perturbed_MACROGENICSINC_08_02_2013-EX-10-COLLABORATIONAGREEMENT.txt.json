The Parties hereby establish a Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, to coordinate and oversee activities on which the Parties collaborate under this Agreement. The Parties agree that participation in the JSC and any subcommittee of the JSC is a right, rather than an obligation of each Party under this Agreement. The JSC shall consist of three (3) representatives from each Party. MacroGenics shall designate one (1) of its representatives as the initial chairperson of the JSC. Thereafter, the role of chairperson will alternate between MacroGenics and Green Cross representatives on a yearly basis. Each Party may replace its appointed JSC representatives at any time upon reasonable written notice to the other Party. The initial representatives and chair of the JSC are set forth in Exhibit F attached hereto. The chair shall have the responsibility to call meetings, circulate meeting agendas at least ten (10) days prior to each regular JSC meeting, draft minutes for each JSC meeting and circulate such minutes for both Parties' written approval. The chair shall have no other authority or special voting power.",

                "explanation": "The original text indicates participation in the JSC is a 'right, rather than an obligation.' The modified text directly contradicts this by stating it is a 'right, and an obligation.' Similarly, it changes the notice of replacement which creates an uncertainty. The modified text also makes the requirements not well defined which adds to uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "1.18 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective under this Agreement, no effort to accomplish such objective as such Party would normally use to accomplish a similar objective of such Party under similar circumstances, it being understood and agreed that with respect to the Development or Commercialization of MGAH22 and Products, such efforts shall not be similar to those efforts and resources commonly used by a Party for a similar biological or pharmaceutical product owned by it or to which it has rights, which product is at a similar stage in its development or product life and is of similar market potential taking into account efficacy, safety, approved labeling, the competitiveness of alternative products in the marketplace, the patent and other proprietary position of the product, and the likelihood of regulatory approval given the regulatory structure involved.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the definition of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" to essentially mean 'no effort' and the efforts will 'not be similar.' This is a direct contradiction which will make the enforcement of the agreement problematic.",

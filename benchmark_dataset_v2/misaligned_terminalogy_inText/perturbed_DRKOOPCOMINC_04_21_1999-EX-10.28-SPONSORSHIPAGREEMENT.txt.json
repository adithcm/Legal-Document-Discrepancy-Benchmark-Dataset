                "explanation": "The agreement uses 'Term' in Article VIII to define the length of the agreement. Changing the reference to 'Duration' in Section 1.1 creates uncertainty about whether 'Term' and 'Duration' refer to the same period, thereby impacting the sponsor's exclusive rights and the length of the sponsorship agreement.",

                "explanation": "Section 2.3 restricts the use of data to 'internal business purposes' and prohibits providing data to 'third parties'. Modifying 'third parties' to 'external entities' creates confusion, as 'external entities' is broader and could include subsidiaries or affiliates of the Sponsor, leading to disputes about the scope of permitted data usage.",

Emdeon may determine the placement and formatting of the Content in the Software, but may alter the essence of the Content without WebMD's consent.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'license' and 'permit' are used interchangeably, creating confusion about the scope of rights granted. The original text prohibits Emdeon from changing the content's substance without approval, while the modified version allows alteration without consent, creating a direct contradiction.",

Nothing herein shall create any association, partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between WebMD and Emdeon.

                "explanation": "The terms 'independent contractor' is switched with 'independent provider' and directly implies a potential collaboration, contradicting the original intent of independence. The text then states that WebMD does have authority to act on behalf of Emdeon, which creates a contradiction with the original prohibition.",

Private Information includes any data or information which the receiving party can demonstrate with oral proof: (i) was already known to it at the time of disclosure; (ii) was independently developed by it without reference to the disclosing party's Private Information; (iii) is in the public domain; (iv) was rightfully disclosed to it by a third party without any obligation of privacy; or (v) is required to be disclosed pursuant to any statutory or regulatory authority or court order, provided that there is no notice given, and the scope of disclosure is not limited.",
                "explanation": "The use of 'Confidential Information' changed to 'Private Information' causes ambiguity. The text now states that oral proof is enough, and also that no notice needs to be given, nor does the scope of the disclosure need to be limited which goes directly against what was initially intended.",

                "original_text": "EXCERPT BEFORE CHANGE: 6. Compensation In consideration for the services and facilities provided by you hereunder, Nationwide (on behalf of the Funds) will pay to you, and you will accept as full payment therefore, a fee at the annual rate designated in Appendix A of the average daily net assets of a Fund's Shares owned of record or beneficially by your customers from time to time for which you provide administrative support services hereunder. Such fee will be computed daily and payable monthly by Nationwide within thirty (30) days of receipt from you of a valid invoice (in excel format) that identifies, for each CUSIP of each Fund, the number of sub-accounts, participants or beneficial shareholders serviced by you and such other information as may be necessary to validate the fee payable.",

Remuneration In consideration for the services and facilities provided by you hereunder, Nationwide (on behalf of the Funds) will remit to you, and you will accept such payment, a commission at a rate to be determined at the sole discretion of Nationwide of the total net assets of a Fund's Shares owned of record or beneficially by your customers from time to time for which you provide administrative support services hereunder. Such commission will be calculated at Nationwide's discretion and remitted at intervals to be determined by Nationwide within ninety (90) days of the end of each calendar quarter following receipt from you of an informal statement that estimates, for each CUSIP of each Fund, the number of sub-accounts, participants or beneficial shareholders serviced by you and general information regarding the number of accounts you're servicing.",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'fee' with 'commission' and changed the payment terms to be determined at Nationwide's sole discretion. This introduces uncertainty about the actual compensation, conflicting with the original fixed 'fee' structure outlined in Appendix A and making enforcement difficult.",

You agree to provide the Funds, upon written request, the taxpayer identification number (\"TIN\"), if known, of any or all Shareholder(s) of an account and the amount, date, name or other identifier of any registered representative(s) associated with the Shareholder(s) or account (if known), and transaction type (purchase, redemption, transfer, or exchange) of every purchase, redemption, transfer, or exchange of Shares held through an account maintained by you during the period covered by the request. 18.1.1 Period Covered by Request. Requests must set forth a specific period, not to exceed 12 months from the date of the request, for which transaction information is sought. A Fund may request transaction information older than 12 months from the date of the request as it deems necessary to investigate compliance with policies established by the Funds for the purpose of eliminating or reducing any dilution of the value of the outstanding shares issued by a Fund.",

You are encouraged to provide the Funds, at your convenience, the taxpayer identification number (\"TIN\"), if available, of some Shareholder(s) of an account and a vague description of any representative associated with any Shareholder(s) or account (if you recall any), and some general information on purchase or sale of Shares held through any account maintained by you, if you have such records. 18.1.1 Period Covered by Request. Requests may cover any period of time and may be updated by the Funds. A Fund may request transaction information at will as it deems necessary to investigate any compliance matter.",
                "explanation": "Changed the obligation to provide shareholder information from 'agree to provide' to 'are encouraged to provide,' replaced very specific instructions with vague request, and changed the timeframe for requests from a specific 12 month limit to at-will. This creates a contradiction making it unclear whether the Servicing Agent is actually obligated to provide the data, and what data it is required to provide, which undermines the original intent of this section.",

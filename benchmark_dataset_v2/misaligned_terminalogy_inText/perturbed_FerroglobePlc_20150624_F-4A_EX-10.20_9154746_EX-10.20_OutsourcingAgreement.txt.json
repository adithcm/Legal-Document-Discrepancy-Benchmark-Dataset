                "explanation": "The term 'Customer' has been replaced with 'Client'. Later in the document both 'Customer' and 'Client' are used interchangeably. Since the contract defines SILICON SMELTERS initially as 'the Customer', the later use of 'Client' introduces ambiguity as to whether 'Client' refers to the same entity or a different one, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

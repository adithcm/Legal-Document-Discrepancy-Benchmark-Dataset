                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensee' to 'Recipient' introduces confusion.

                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensee' to 'Customer' at the signing section directly conflicts with the initial definition and potentially alters the legal standing of Glu Mobile Inc. It raises questions about whether 'Customer' carries the same rights, duties, and liabilities originally assigned to the 'Licensee,' creating substantial uncertainty about contract enforcement.",

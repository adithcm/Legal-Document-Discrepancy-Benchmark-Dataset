                "explanation": "The term 'Term' has been replaced with 'Duration', but the agreement later still references the original 'Term' potentially creating confusion about the agreed-upon time period. Additionally, the notice period for termination has been changed from thirty to ninety days, leading to direct conflict and uncertainty on termination clauses.",

DeltaThree shall reimburse PrimeCall for all customer assistance expenses directly related to users of the Calling Card. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the quality of client support shall be subject to the approval of DeltaThree.",
                "explanation": "Here the key term 'customer service' is changed to 'customer support', 'customer assistance', and 'client support', creating ambiguity whether PrimeCall is supposed to be outsourcing customer service, customer support, customer assistance, or client support. This creates uncertainty around PrimeCall's obligations. Moreover, the phrase 'level of customer service' is altered to the 'quality of client support' introducing a different standard that leads to enforcement uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'notices' is changed to 'notifications', 'communications' is changed to 'correspondence' and 'telecopy' is changed to 'facsimile', while 'registered' is changed to 'recorded'. The alteration between 'notices' and 'notifications' opens up questions about whether formal legal demands meet the standard, while the alteration between 'communications' and 'correspondence' opens up whether informal discussions are applicable. Similarly, while 'telecopy' and 'facsimile' are technically synonymous, their interchangeable use causes confusion as to whether the contract requires a specific format and can lead to confusion for international parties.",

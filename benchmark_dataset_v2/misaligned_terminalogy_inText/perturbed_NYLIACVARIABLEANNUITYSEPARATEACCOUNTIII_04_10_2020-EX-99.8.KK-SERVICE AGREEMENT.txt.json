(\"FIIOC\") and NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION (\"Company\"). Hereinafter, NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION will also be referred to as the 'Service Recipient'.",
                "explanation": "Introducing 'Service Recipient' as an alternative term for 'Company' sets the stage for later contradictions, even though it seems like simple renaming here.",

In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows:\n\nAt the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.",
                "changed_text": "3. Compensation to Service Recipient. In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to provide a quarterly remuneration to the Service Recipient, calculated according to internal policies of FIIOC, taking into account the market conditions and the volume of inquiries handled.  The specific calculation method will be at the sole discretion of FIIOC.",
                "explanation": "Replaces the defined compensation method with a vague reference to 'internal policies' and 'market conditions,' which contradicts the original explicit formula. The term 'Company' is still used in conjunction with 'Service Recipient', raising questions.",

FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Company (1) if required by any applicable law or regulation, (2) if so required by action of the Fund(s) Board of Trustees, or (3) if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder.",

FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of the Service Recipientâ€™s Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder.",
                "explanation": "Altering the termination notice period for 'Service Recipient' from 'at any time' to '30 days' while retaining 'Company's' original termination terms introduces a contradiction. This creates ambiguity as to which termination clause applies to New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation, as it is referred to by both terms. The use of both 'Service Recipient' and 'Company' when referring to the same entity causes confusion.",

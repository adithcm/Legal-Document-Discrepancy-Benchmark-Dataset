                "explanation": "The term 'Assignee Party' is replaced with 'Recipient'. Although context implies they are the same, failing to explicitly define Recipient creates ambiguity and introduces inconsistency. This leads to a contradiction because, in other sections of the contract, 'Assignee Party' is used as the main identifier, thus disrupting uniformity.",

                "explanation": "In Section 2.1.1, the term 'Assignee Party' is changed to 'Receiver' in subsection (a). This change introduces confusion because the document now refers to the same entity in two different ways, creating a contradiction.

                "explanation": "Changing 'Confidential Information' to 'Sensitive Data' in the definition section, while Section 6.2 still defines 'Confidential Information,' creates a fundamental conflict. The contract now lacks a clear definition for 'Confidential Information' but continues to use it, making its enforcement uncertain.",

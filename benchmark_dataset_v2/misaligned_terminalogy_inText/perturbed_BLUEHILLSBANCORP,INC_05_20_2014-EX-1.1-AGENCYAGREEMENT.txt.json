                "explanation": "This change duplicates the language, replacing “appoint” with “expects” and “Blue Hills Parties” with “Blue Hills Organizations”. Since this section outlines key responsibilities, using weaker language (“expects”) and a potentially different entity (given the first change) creates uncertainty about the Agent’s firm obligations. It is uncertain if the Agent must fulfill the responsibilities since the language is not definitive.",

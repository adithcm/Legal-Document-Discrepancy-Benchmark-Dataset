                "explanation": "The original agreement clearly defines \"Detto\" as Detto Technologies. By changing the definition of \"Detto\" to \"Customer\" in the introductory paragraph, while maintaining \"Detto\" throughout the rest of the document, we introduce a contradiction. This creates uncertainty as to whether \"Detto\" and \"Customer\" are intended to be the same entity or different entities.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"Detto\" with \"The Distributor\" and \"Detto\" with \"salesperson\" creates a contradiction. The agreement is between PivX and Detto, but now the text refers to \"The Distributor\" and a \"salesperson\", which are not defined and may not be the same entity. This creates ambiguity regarding the contractual obligations.",

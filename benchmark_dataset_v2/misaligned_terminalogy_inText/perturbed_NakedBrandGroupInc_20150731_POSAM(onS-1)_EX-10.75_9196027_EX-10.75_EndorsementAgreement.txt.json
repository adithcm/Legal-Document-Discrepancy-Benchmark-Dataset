                "explanation": "The contract initially refers to 'Wade Team' then interchanges this term for 'Wade Enterprises' to cause confusion. 'Wade Team' implies it can be designers and creative personnels, whereas 'Wade Enterprises' refers to a limited liability company. This creates confusion about who is responsible for approving the product designs.",

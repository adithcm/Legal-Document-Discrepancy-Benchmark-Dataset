                "explanation": "Changing 'Software' to 'Applications' introduces ambiguity. The contract later defines 'PROGRAM' which includes 'ForceField PSS software'. It's now unclear if 'Applications' is synonymous with 'PROGRAM' or refers to something else, creating confusion about the scope of maintenance.",

                "original_text": "XIMAGE will provide to MORPHO during the term hereof \"Software      Maintenance Services\" which shall include remedial maintenance service      (i.e, error fixing and/or work arounds) for any significant error,      malfunction or defect (collectively in \"Error\") in the Software so that      the Software will operate in accordance with the specifications set      forth in the related documentation.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'Software Maintenance Services' to 'System Maintenance Services' and 'Software' to 'System', we create uncertainty. The contract focuses on 'Software' in its definition of 'PROGRAM'. Now, there's a question of whether 'System' encompasses just the software, or the hardware and network as well, impacting the scope of XIMAGE's maintenance obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'property right' to 'intellectual property right'. The original text says 'Software infringes any United States patent, copyright, trademark or other property right'. This has now been updated to 'Program infringes any United States patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right held'. The conflict is in the fact that 'property right' could include physical property damage whereas 'intellectual property right' means physical damages would not be protected.",

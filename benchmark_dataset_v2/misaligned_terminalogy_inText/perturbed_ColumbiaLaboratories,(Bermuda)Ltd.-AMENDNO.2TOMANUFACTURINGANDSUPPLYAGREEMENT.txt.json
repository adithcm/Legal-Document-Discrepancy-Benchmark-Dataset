                "original_text": "6. A new Section 2.3 (n) shall be inserted into the Existing Agreement as follows:\n\n\"2.3 (n) KPIs. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date the Parties shall agree in good faith key performance indicators the Supplier will agree to achieve when supplying the Products and such key performance indicators will be set out in an amendment agreed by the Parties to this Agreement.\"",
                "changed_text": "6. A new Section 2.3 (n) shall be inserted into the Existing Agreement as follows:\n\n\"2.3 (n) KPIs. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date the Parties shall agree in good faith on performance metrics the Vendor will strive to meet when supplying the Products; such performance metrics will be documented in a separate internal company document.\"",
                "explanation": "The term 'key performance indicators' is changed to 'performance metrics,' and 'Supplier' is changed to 'Vendor.' Furthermore, the requirement to set out the KPIs in an 'amendment agreed by the Parties to this Agreement' is replaced with 'documented in a separate internal company document.' This creates ambiguity as it is unclear whether these terms refer to the same concept and how they are contractually binding.",

Any additional machinery, equipment and materials provided by Columbia to Fleet during the Term shall be Columbia Equipment unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties. During the Term, Columbia shall review and update Exhibit B in December of each year to include any additional machinery, equipment and materials provided to Fleet.",

Any additional machinery, equipment and materials provided by Columbia to Fleet during the Term shall be Columbia Equipment unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties. During the Term, Columbia shall review and update Exhibit B in December of each year to include any additional machinery, equipment and materials provided to Fleet.",
                "explanation": "The primary term 'Columbia Equipment' is being changed to 'Columbia Assets' which creates an issue because 'Columbia Equipment' is still being used later in the text. This change introduces potential confusion about the exact definition of the term, especially concerning ownership, liability, and maintenance responsibilities.",

Any such audit undertaken by Columbia QA or any other person appointed by Columbia shall be at Columbia's sole cost and expense. Columbia or any other person appointed by Columbia shall have the right, in connection with any such audit, to inspect and obtain copies of any records or other documents and materials associated with or related to the manufacture of the Product.

                "explanation": "Changing 'Columbia QA' to 'Columbia Quality Assurance' and 'Columbia Equipment' to 'Columbia Assets' in one area but not the others and/or fully updating definition leads to a contradiction. This could cause confusion about the roles and responsibilities of Columbia Quality Assurance vs. Columbia QA.",

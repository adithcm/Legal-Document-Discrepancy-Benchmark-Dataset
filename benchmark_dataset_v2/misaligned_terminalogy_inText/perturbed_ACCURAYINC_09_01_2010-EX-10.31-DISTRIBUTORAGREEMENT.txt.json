                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the  Products and/or Services by Siemens.",
                "changed_text": "1.3. \"Distributor\" means Siemens only. Its Affiliates, or any Third Party do not have distribution rights for the Products and/or Services by Siemens unless explicitly authorized by Accuray.",
                "explanation": "The original text includes Siemens, its Affiliates, or any Third Party as Distributors. The changed text limits 'Distributor' to only Siemens, which creates a contradiction as other sections may refer to Affiliates or Third Parties as Distributors, implying they have distribution rights.",

                "original_text": "4.1.1. Fulfillment of Executed Purchase Orders. Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied are of good quality as  further described below. Accuray will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Distributor or Customer, as  applicable, in a timely manner those Products and Services required to fill confirmed Purchase Orders received from  Distributor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "4.1.1. Fulfillment of Executed Purchase Orders. Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied meet minimum standards. Accuray will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Distributor or End-User, as applicable, in a timely manner those Products and Services required to fulfill approved Purchase Orders received from Distributor as per this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the products must be of 'good quality' where the changed text reduces this requirement to 'meet minimum standards'. Also, 'Customer' is replaced with 'End-User' which creates ambiguity since this term is not previously defined, leading to potential disputes about the quality standards the products must meet and who is receiving them.",

                "original_text": "5.3. Compensation. Except as otherwise provided herein, Distributor's only compensation for its efforts on Accuray's behalf shall be the  margins it earns on the resale of Products and  commissions on sales of Services, and Distributor shall bear all of the expenses which it incurs in making those efforts.",
                "changed_text": "5.3. Remuneration. Unless specified otherwise, the Sales Agent's exclusive remuneration for its efforts on Accuray's behalf will consist of profit from product resales and incentives from service sales. The Agent is responsible for all costs incurred during these activities. ",
                "explanation": "The original text refers to the entity as a “Distributor” and compensations is “compensation”. The changed version calls them a “Sales Agent” and the payment is named “remuneration”, which introduces different types of roles and therefore can lead to confusion on which rules to follow. The terms used in the modified text could imply a different legal relationship (e.g., agency vs. distribution), affecting liability and obligations.",

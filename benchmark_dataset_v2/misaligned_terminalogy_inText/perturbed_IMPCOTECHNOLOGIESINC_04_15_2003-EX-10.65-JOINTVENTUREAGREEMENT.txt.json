                "original_text": "WHEREAS IMPCO and MIL/MINDA have entered into a joint venture to promote a company under the name of MINDA IMPCO LIMITED for manufacturing and selling alternate fuel management systems and components, including but not limited to CNG, LPG and Propane Kits for operating motor vehicles, forklifts, industrial engines and other engines of various horsepower in India ;",

                "explanation": "The term 'joint venture' is replaced with 'collaborative effort.' While seemingly similar, 'joint venture' has specific legal connotations involving shared control and liability. 'Collaborative effort' is more ambiguous and could imply a less formal arrangement, potentially leading to disputes over the extent of each party's obligations and liabilities.",

An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it controls, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.",
                "changed_text": "In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, the following shall have the meaning as set forth against them below: \"Affiliate(s)\" shall mean with respect to any Party to this Agreement any entity which has a business relationship with such Party. An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, sixty percent (60%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it influences, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate(s)' and 'control' is modified to introduce inconsistencies. The change from 'controls, is controlled by, or is under common control' to 'has a business relationship with' significantly broadens and weakens the definition of 'Affiliate(s),' making it unclear what constitutes an affiliate. The threshold for control is changed from 51% to 60%, 'controls' to 'influences', raising questions about the applicable standard for determining affiliation and control.",

                "explanation": "The term 'trademark' is replaced with 'logo.' While often used interchangeably in common parlance, these terms have distinct legal meanings. A trademark is a legally protected symbol representing a brand, while a logo is a visual symbol or design. Using 'logo' instead of 'trademark' creates ambiguity regarding the legal protection afforded to the symbol, potentially weakening the JVC's intellectual property rights.",

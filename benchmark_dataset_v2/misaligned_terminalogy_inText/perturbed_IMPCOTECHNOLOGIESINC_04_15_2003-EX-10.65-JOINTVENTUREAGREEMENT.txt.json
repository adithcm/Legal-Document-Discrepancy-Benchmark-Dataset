                "explanation": "The original text mentions MIL's 'technical, marketing skills and financial wherewithal.' The changed text removes 'marketing skills and financial wherewithal,' creating ambiguity about MIL's complete capabilities and potentially contradicting later sections that rely on these skills. Here, 'marketing skills and financial wherewithal' is changed to technical skills. It creates uncertainty in the contract because MIL’s financial capabilities may come under question",

                "explanation": "The original text defines IMPCO's representatives as 'Directors' and the modified version replaces it with 'Executives.' The terms 'Directors' and 'Executives' are used to describe the nominated members of the board; it is undefined and can have significantly different implications and rights, which may be in contradiction of what a ‘Director’ is supposed to be.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to the export products being sold with the 'trademark IMPCO.' The modified text changes this to 'logo IMPCO.' Changing from 'trademark' to 'logo' without clarification creates ambiguity as 'logo' is a more general visual symbol and offers less legal protection, weakening IMPCO's brand protection rights in export markets. This contradicts the initial trademark registration requirement, as a 'logo' is not necessarily a registered trademark.",

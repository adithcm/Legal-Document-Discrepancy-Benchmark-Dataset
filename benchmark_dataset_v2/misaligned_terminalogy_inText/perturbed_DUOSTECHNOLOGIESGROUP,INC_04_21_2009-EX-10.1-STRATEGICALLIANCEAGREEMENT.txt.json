                "explanation": "The terms 'agent', 'partner', and 'affiliate' are used interchangeably to describe the relationship between ISA and Rubicon. This creates ambiguity regarding the specific legal obligations and responsibilities of each party, leading to potential disputes.",

DEFINITIONS.\n\n     1.1 Confidential Information shall mean all non-public information of a Party, which is disclosed to the other Party hereunder, including,  without limitation, trade secrets, technical information, business information, sales information, marketing information, customer-buying patterns,  algorithms, customer and potential customer lists and identities, product sales plans, sublicense agreements, inventions, developments,  discoveries, software, know-how, methods, techniques, formulae, data, processes and other trade secrets and proprietary ideas, whether or not protectable under patent, trademark, copyright or other areas of law, and any other information marked as \"proprietary\"  or \"confidential\" at the  time of disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, \"Confidential Information\" shall not include any information that (a) was or has become  publicly available without restriction through no fault of the receiving Party or its employees or agents; (b) is received without restriction from a  third party that, to the best knowledge of the receiving Party, did not have an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; (c) was  rightfully in possession of the receiving Party without restriction prior to its disclosure by the other Party; or (d) was independently developed by  employees of the receiving Party that had no knowledge of or access to such information, as evidenced by written records of the receiving Party.",

DEFINITIONS.\n\n     1.1 Protected Data shall mean all non-public information of a Party, which is disclosed to the other Party hereunder, including,  without limitation, trade secrets, technical information, business information, sales information, marketing information, customer-buying patterns,  algorithms, customer and potential customer lists and identities, product sales plans, sublicense agreements, inventions, developments,  discoveries, software, know-how, methods, techniques, formulae, data, processes and other trade secrets and proprietary ideas, whether or not protectable under patent, trademark, copyright or other areas of law, and any other information marked as \"proprietary\"  or \"confidential\" at the  time of disclosure.

                "explanation": "The contract defines 'Confidential Information' but then uses the term 'Protected Data' without defining it. This creates confusion as to whether 'Protected Data' is the same as 'Confidential Information' or refers to something else, potentially weakening the confidentiality protections. The word 'Confidential Information' has not been replaced as there will be confusion between the two.",

In consideration of the services set forth in Section 2, ISA will sell or market the Rubicon Offerings at pre agreed list prices,  and shall receive a commission on the gross revenues paid for the Rubicon Offerings less VAT if applicable of the Commission Rate; provided,  however, that in the event that Rubicon proposes to charge at other than the Day Rate for the software development the Parties shall use all  reasonable endeavours to agree an equitable adjustment to the Commission Rate.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 ISA Compensation. In consideration of the services set forth in Section 2, ISA will sell or market the Rubicon Offerings at pre agreed list prices,  and shall receive a percentage on the gross revenues paid for the Rubicon Offerings less VAT if applicable of the Commission Rate; provided,  however, that in the event that Rubicon proposes to charge at other than the Day Rate for the software development the Parties shall use all  reasonable endeavours to agree an equitable adjustment to the Commission Rate.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Fees' is replaced with 'Compensation'. While seemingly synonymous, 'compensation' can be interpreted more broadly than 'fees', potentially including benefits or other forms of payment not explicitly covered. The use of percentage instead of commission also gives more ambiguity.",

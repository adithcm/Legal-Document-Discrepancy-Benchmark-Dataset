At all times during the Term of this Agreement, Zanotti shall warrant the Products to purchasers of AETRU Systems in accordance with the terms of its standard warranty attached hereto as Exhibit \"C\"  (\"End User Warranty\"), as such End User Warranty may be  modified from time to time by Zanotti, provided however that at no time shall such End User Warranty provide for a warranty coverage period of  less than thirty-six (36) months from the time of purchase by the initial end-user. A copy of the End User Warranty shall be included as part of the  packaging included with all Product delivered to Aura and Aura shall distribute each Product with all warranty cards, a copy of the End User  Warranty and all other",

At all times during the Term of this Agreement, Zanotti may guarantee the Products to purchasers of AETRU Systems based on Zanotti’s discretion, warranty terms may be modified by Zanotti without notice. A copy of the User Protection Plan, if available, should be included as packaging. Guarantee details may vary, and specific claims must follow current Zanotti policies.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a minimum 36-month warranty, while the modified text uses 'guarantee,' which implies an optional pledge, and allows for changes to warranty terms without notice, creating a contradiction. This introduces uncertainty about the actual warranty commitment and deviates from the original text’s intention of a fixed minimum guarantee duration.",

(b) Non-interference: Zanotti’s execution of this agreement does not currently appear to contravene existing major commitments, but this is based on current information and is subject to change. (c) Pending Challenges: To Zanotti's understanding, there are no immediate, known legal barriers to fulfilling this agreement, but undisclosed issues may emerge. (d) Intellectual Property Disclaimer: Zanotti offers no explicit assurances that the Product avoids infringing third-party intellectual property rights; potential conflicts may exist.",
                "explanation": "The original 'Representations and Warranties' provides strong assurances about Zanotti's power, authority, and non-infringement. The modified 'Declarations and Assurances' weakens these assurances significantly by introducing phrases like 'subject to internal review processes,' 'based on current information and is subject to change,' and 'potential conflicts may exist,' creating contradictory levels of commitment and creating uncertainty around Zanotti's actual obligations and liabilities.",

Zanotti agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Aura, including its employees, agents and affiliates, harmless from and against any  and all payments, damages, demands, claims, losses, expenses, costs, obligations and liabilities (including reasonable attorney's fees and costs),  which arise out of, result from or are related to: (i) any breach by Zanotti of any provision contained in this Agreement, including without limitation  any obligation, representation, warranty or covenant herein; (ii) any occupational injury or illness sustained by any employee or agent of Zanotti  to the extent claims are made against, or held to be payable by",
                "changed_text": "8.17 Protection. Zanotti may agree to potentially cover Aura's direct costs, if possible, with respect to verified and undisputed direct losses resulting solely and directly from Zanotti’s gross and willful misconduct relating to critical and material elements of this Agreement; however, indirect costs, consequential damages, legal fees and costs are not covered. This protection is limited to the actual amount of documented direct losses and will be subject to a separate written agreement outlining specifics. Routine commercial matters will not be subject to this protection.",
                "explanation": "The original 'Indemnity' clause provides a broad indemnification obligation for Zanotti. The modified 'Protection' clause severely restricts this obligation by limiting it to direct losses resulting from 'gross and willful misconduct,' excluding various costs, and making it subject to a separate agreement. This creates a contradiction because the original clause suggests comprehensive coverage, while the modified clause significantly narrows the scope, leading to uncertainty about the extent of Zanotti's liability.",

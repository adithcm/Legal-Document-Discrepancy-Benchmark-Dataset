                "original_text": "Diplomat agrees to pay KI, Inc. as royalty a sum equal to  % of the net wholesale volume of the products covered by this Agreement by Diplomat and its affiliated, associated, or subsidiary companies. The term \"net wholesale volume\" shall mean gross sales to all customers; less returns, trade discounts and cash discounts; but no deduction shall be made for other discounts or uncollectible accounts. No costs incurred in the manufacture, sale, distribution, or exploitation of the products covered by this Agreement shall be deducted from any royalty payable by Diplomat.",
                "changed_text": "Diplomat agrees to pay KI, Inc. as royalty a sum equal to  % of the net wholesale volume of the products covered by this Agreement by Diplomat and its affiliated, associated, or subsidiary companies. The term \"net wholesale volume\" shall mean gross sales to direct retailers; less returns. Costs incurred in the sale of the products covered by this Agreement shall be deducted from any royalty payable by Diplomat.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'net wholesale volume' is changed. Originally, it allows deductions for returns, trade discounts, and cash discounts, and disallows deductions for manufacturing costs. The modified version allows only deductions for returns and explicitly allows deduction of costs incurred in the sale. This creates a contradiction in how royalties are calculated, impacting KI, Inc.'s earnings.",

                "original_text": "Travel expenses of KI in connection with all scheduled personal appearances under this Agreement, as well the travel expenses of KI's child, the child's nanny, KI's hair and make-up assistant of KI's choosing, and two (2) additional traveling companions of KI's choosing (collectively referred to as KI's \"entourage\"), shall be provided by Diplomat. KI and the members of her entourage shall travel via first class air and portal-to-portal limousine ground transportation. In addition, KI and the members of her entourage shall be lodged in first class hotel accommodations and all of them shall be reimbursed for all meals and other incidental expenses in connection with such appearances. All the above travel expenses of KI and the members of her entourage shall be billed directly to Diplomat.",
                "changed_text": "Travel expenses of KI in connection with all scheduled personal appearances under this Agreement shall be provided by Diplomat. KI and approved members accompanying her, as determined by Diplomat, shall be provided with standard class travel and accommodations, with the specifics to be outlined in a separate travel policy.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the initial agreement on 'entourage' and travel conditions. The original text specifies first-class travel and accommodations for KI's entourage, while the modified text limits the scope of covered individuals (now determined by Diplomat's approval) and sets standard class travel and accommodations as the norm, subject to a separate travel policy. The explicit, detailed conditions have been replaced by a vague reference to a travel policy, creating conflicting obligations.",

Diplomat further agrees that (a) such products will be manufactured, sold and distributed in accordance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, (b) that the policy of sale, distribution, and/or exploitation by Diplomat shall be to the best advantage of KI, Inc. and KI, and (c) that the latter policy shall in no manner reflect adversely upon the good name of KI and KI, Inc.",
                "changed_text": "Diplomat agrees that the products covered by this Agreement shall be of acceptable quality, meeting minimum industry standards. Diplomat agrees that such products will be manufactured, sold, and distributed in compliance with company guidelines.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a high standard for product quality, aiming to 'enhance KI's name' and adhere to all applicable laws. The revised version lowers the quality standard to 'acceptable quality, meeting minimum industry standards' and replaces legal compliance with adherence to 'company guidelines.' This creates a contradiction by allowing Diplomat to prioritize their standards over KI's brand image and legal requirements.",

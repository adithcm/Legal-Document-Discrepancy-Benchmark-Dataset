                "explanation": "The terms \"Product,\" \"Goods,\" and \"Merchandise\" are used interchangeably without defining whether they all refer to the same hemp biomass. This creates confusion about what exactly Shi Farms is obligated to sell and Gridiron is obligated to purchase.",

Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content.",

Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Raw Material must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content.",
                "explanation": "The terms \"Biomass\", \"Material\", and \"Raw Material\" are used interchangeably without defining them. One sentence refers to \"Biomass\", the next to \"Material\", and then the third to \"Raw Material\" raising questions whether the 30,000 lbs. has to be only Biomass, only Material, or only Raw Material. This is a direct contradiction, because while the main sentence says 30,000 lbs. of hemp biomass, the next sentence dictates the requirements for \"Raw Material\", suggesting it is not always \"Biomass\".",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to 'product' and 'Product,' while the changed text uses 'items' and 'Goods.' This introduces uncertainty, because the items quarantined might not be what was bargained for as 'Product', potentially affecting the quality and compliance standards specified in the agreement.",

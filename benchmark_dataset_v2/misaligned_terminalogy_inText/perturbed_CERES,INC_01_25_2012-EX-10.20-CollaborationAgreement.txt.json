SCHEDULES may specify that similar rights are granted with respect to defined elements of CERES BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.",

SCHEDULES may specify that similar rights are granted with respect to defined elements of CERES BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits the usage of CERES Intellectual Property 'solely' for the performance of Research Projects. The changed text eliminates the word solely and replaces 'purpose of' with 'any purpose', creating a contradiction within the terms of the same section, leading to uncertainty about usage rights.",

Any commercialization (including, but not limited to, the grant of commercialization licenses) of JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and/or OTHER RESEARCH RESULTS shall result in CERES paying IGER a reasonable remuneration (whether as a royalty or in some other form as the Parties may agree) to be negotiated in good faith. The terms for remuneration will be specified, with respect to specific RESEARCH PROJECTS, JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and/or OTHER RESEARCH RESULTS, either in the respective SCHEDULES or in other agreements to be executed by the Parties.",

                "explanation": "The original clause grants CERES the right to use and exploit JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY for 'any and all' uses and fields. This change modifies that to 'specific uses and specified fields', contradicting the initial assertion. This introduces ambiguity as to the scope of CERES's rights, requiring further clarification on what constitutes 'specific uses and specified fields'.",

                "explanation": "The original definition limits 'knowledge' to 'actual knowledge.' Replacing 'actual' with 'constructive' broadens the scope of knowledge to include what CERES 'should have known,' even if they did not actually know it. This introduces a contradiction because it's unclear which standard of knowledge applies for warranties.",

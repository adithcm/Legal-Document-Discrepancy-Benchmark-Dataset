Each of PrimeCall and DeltaThree recognize that the absence of a time limitation in this Section 8.01  [Confidentiality] is reasonable and properly required for the protection of the other party hereto and in the event that the absence of such limitation is deemed to be unreasonable by a court of competent jurisdiction, PrimeCall and DeltaThree each agree and submit to the imposition of such a limitation as said court shall deem reasonable.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers to 'confidential proprietary information.' The modified version introduces 'trade secrets' alongside. Without defining 'trade secrets' and whether they are distinct from 'confidential proprietary information', it creates ambiguity. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about which information is protected, especially if the legal definitions of 'confidential information' and 'trade secrets' differ significantly.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'assign' and 'affiliate,' whereas the modified version introduces 'transfer,' 'subsidiary,' and 'acquisition.' The terms 'assign' and 'transfer' are used interchangeably and without definition, causing confusion as to whether the original restriction on assignment is still valid with a 'transfer.' 'Affiliate' is replaced by 'subsidiary' and 'merger' with 'acquisition,' potentially narrowing/broadening the scope of permissible transfers without DeltaThree's consent, generating uncertainty.",

By changing the verbage without a clear definition of the context, it is not clear whether the original terms mean the same thing, or the new verbiage expands or limits the initial scope of the contract.",

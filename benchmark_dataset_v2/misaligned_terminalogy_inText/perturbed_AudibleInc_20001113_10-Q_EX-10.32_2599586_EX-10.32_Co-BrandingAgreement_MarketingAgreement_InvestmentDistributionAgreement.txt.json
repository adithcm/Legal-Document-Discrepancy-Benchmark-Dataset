By changing this in the introduction to \"Entities,\" the contract creates ambiguity about whether other sections referring to \"Parties\" still apply to both ACSI and Company or if \"Entities\" represent an undefined, broader set of actors, introducing uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text consistently uses \"Party\" to refer to ACSI and Company. Introducing the term \"Participant\" creates ambiguity: is a \"Participant\" the same as a \"Party\", or could it include affiliates or other related entities?

However, the following sentences continue referring to \"Parties\" which suggests ACSI and Company. This is conflicting since the first sentence opens the possibility of a third-party or other business structure.",

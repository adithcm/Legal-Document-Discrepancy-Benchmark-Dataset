Confidential Information includes, without limitation, (a) all information relating to a Party's or its Affiliates' technology, customers, business plans, promotional and marketing activities, finances and other business affairs; (b) all third party information that a Party or its Affiliates is obligated to keep confidential; and (c) the terms of this Agreement. Confidential Information may be contained in tangible materials, such as drawings, data, specifications, reports and computer programs, or may be in the nature of unwritten knowledge. Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) has become publicly available without breach of this Agreement, (ii) can be shown by documentation to have been known to the Receiving Party at the time of its receipt from the Disclosing Party or its Affiliates without a breach of confidentiality or other improper means, (iii) is received from a third party who did not acquire or disclose such information by a wrongful or tortious act or (iv) can be shown by documentation to have been independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to any Confidential Information.",

Protected Information includes, without limitation, the specific financial terms outlined in Section 5 of this agreement. Protected Information excludes any information a Receiving Party learns through general business interactions or from observing the Disclosing Party's publicly available products and services. Protected Information does not include any information that (i) has become publicly available without breach of this Agreement, (ii) can be shown by documentation to have been known to the Receiving Party at the time of its receipt from the Disclosing Party or its Affiliates without a breach of confidentiality or other improper means, (iii) is received from a third party who did not acquire or disclose such information by a wrongful or tortious act or (iv) can be shown by documentation to have been independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to any Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines “Confidential Information” broadly, including information that ‘reasonably should be considered as confidential,’ regardless of whether it’s explicitly marked as such. The modified text restricts this definition, requiring the information to be ‘explicitly marked as 'Confidential' and delivered in tangible form', and renames the section 'Protected Information', while the term 'Confidential Information' is used elsewhere. This creates ambiguity as to which information is subject to confidentiality obligations. It makes the agreement internally inconsistent regarding the scope of confidential data, affecting data protection clauses.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the Company 'will comply' with all applicable laws, establishing a clear and unambiguous obligation. The modified text softens this requirement by stating that the Company 'will endeavor to comply with all regulations, and will exert commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that [activities] adhere to the spirit of all applicable Laws.' This change effectively transforms a strict compliance requirement into a 'best efforts' obligation, making it more difficult to enforce legal compliance. This shift significantly alters the Company's legal liability and obligations under the contract.",

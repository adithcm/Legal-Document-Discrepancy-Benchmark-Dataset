                "explanation": "The term 'Agreement' is a key defined term. By stating that it will be interpreted according to 'common business usage' instead of the defined term introduces ambiguity and creates contradiction on how the contract should be interpreted. There is uncertainty on whether or not the definition of 'Agreement' is valid.",

CONSIDERATION.",
                "explanation": "By adding \"unless specified otherwise\" to the definition of “Treated Integra Product” introduces an internal contradiction as it allows the term to deviate from its defined meaning in unspecified circumstances. This creates uncertainty in its enforcement and allows for subjective interpretation.",

                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction by adding \"with the understanding that such rights can be reduced or altered based on PcoMed's discretion\" to the grant of exclusive rights. This directly conflicts with the 'sole and exclusive worldwide right' previously stated, undermining the agreement's enforceability. It creates uncertainty about Integra's rights and PcoMed's obligations.",

Licensee owns and operates the following radio station (the \"Station\") pursuant to licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"): WQHT-FM, New York, NY (Facility ID No. 19615). The Station has the capability to transmit an in-band, on-channel (\"IBOC\") digital broadcast signal.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Station' is replaced with 'Facility' in the first sentence. Later uses of 'Station' remain unchanged. This creates ambiguity as to whether 'Station' and 'Facility' are interchangeable terms, which can lead to confusion about the scope of the agreement's application. Which entity owns what?",

                "explanation": "Here, 'Programmer' and 'delivered' are changed to 'provider' and 'transmitted' respectively. This introduces uncertainty. Is the 'provider' the same entity as the 'Programmer'? Are the obligations different based on whether programs are 'delivered' or 'transmitted'? It can affect liability if issues occur with the transmitted programming.",

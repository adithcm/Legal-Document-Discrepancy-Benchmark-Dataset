                "changed_text": "Kiromic will contribute to costs related to R&D, including clinical development expenses, subject to budget approvals.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a firm commitment to bear all costs. The revised text weakens this to a contribution subject to budget approvals, creating uncertainty about the extent of Kiromic's financial responsibility. This directly introduces conflicting obligations within the same section.",

                "changed_text": "The Industrial Property Rights on the Results, as well as the Intellectual Property Rights realized in the research activities covered by this JV, are primarily owned by the party that directly innovated such IP, unless otherwise specified by both parties by a prior agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states joint ownership of intellectual property. The modified text gives primary ownership to the innovating party unless otherwise agreed, contradicting the initial joint ownership clause. This introduces uncertainty and potential disputes over IP rights.",

                "changed_text": "Upon withdrawal, Kiromic may, at its discretion, provide a financial contribution to Molipharma for demonstrably necessary expenses incurred until the notice of withdrawal is received, subject to the total available JV funds at the time of withdrawal.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on Kiromic to cover all expenses. The revised text changes this to a discretionary contribution subject to available funds, contradicting the mandatory obligation and introducing financial uncertainty for Molipharma upon Kiromic's withdrawal. The shift from 'obliged' to 'may, at its discretion' creates a direct conflict.",

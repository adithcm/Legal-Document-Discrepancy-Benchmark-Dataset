                "explanation": "Changing \"Broker Dealer\" to \"Intermediary Firm\" in the initial definition creates confusion. Throughout the document, 'Broker Dealer' is used extensively, and this single change introduces uncertainty about whether the terms are interchangeable, potentially affecting the scope and obligations of the agreement. Now the definition section contains a contradiction.",

Periodically, Issuer or Distributor may   ask Broker Dealer to, and Broker Dealer agrees to, certify that it is compliance with the requirements,   representations and warranties in this paragraph.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'customer identification program' to 'client identification program'. This introduces a subtle but significant contradiction. While 'customer' and 'client' might seem interchangeable in some contexts, regulatory definitions often distinguish between them. Using both terms creates ambiguity regarding the specific requirements the Broker Dealer must meet, especially in the context of regulatory compliance. Does the program require separate standards? It is unclear.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Broker Dealer\" to \"Financial Advisor\" in the first line, while retaining 'Broker Dealer' later in the same section introduces an internal contradiction in section 22. It creates confusion regarding whether the indemnity applies to the Broker Dealer (as defined elsewhere) or only to the Financial Advisor. This ambiguity could significantly impact the enforceability of the indemnification clause.",

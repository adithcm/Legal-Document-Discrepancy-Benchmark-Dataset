                "explanation": "Using both 'Products' and 'Goods' within the same paragraph dealing with acceptance criteria introduces a contradiction. It becomes unclear whether the acceptance criteria apply equally to both, or if there's a distinction. This impacts the acceptance/rejection process.",

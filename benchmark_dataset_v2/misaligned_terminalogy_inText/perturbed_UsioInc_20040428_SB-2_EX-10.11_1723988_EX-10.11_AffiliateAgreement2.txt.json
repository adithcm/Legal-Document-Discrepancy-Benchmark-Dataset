                "explanation": "The term 'ISO sponsorship agreement' is replaced with 'ISO certification Agreement'. This introduces ambiguity because it is unclear whether the original agreement refers to sponsorship or some certification requirement. This creates uncertainty about the terms of termination.",

All such Contractors must process Merchant applications and transactions exclusively through Network 1. Network 1 consents to waive said exclusivity requirement with respect to specific Merchants in the event Network 1 (i) is unable to process for such specific Merchant, and (ii) the declined Merchant is not accepted for processing by a provider that Network 1 designates for specific Merchant's that are declined by Network 1 (\"B Bank Source\"). Affiliate shall disclose to Network 1 all information known to Affiliate with respect to the background, character, employment history, business experience and other information regarding each prospective Contractor relevant to Network 1's determination whether to accept or not accept each prospective Contractor.",

                "explanation": "The term 'CONTRACTORS' is replaced with 'PERSONNEL' at the very beginning of the section. This creates a confusion between roles that Affiliates need to consider and how those roles correlate to approval and all other aspects of the agreement. Also, Section 2.01 still references [CONTRACTORS], making the first line of text a contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Merchant accounts' is replaced by 'Client accounts.' This creates a conflict because 'Merchant' and 'Client' are used throughout the document to denote parties with different levels of access to the service. This is a subtle term difference that can alter obligations or rights regarding termination conditions because the collateralization of assets is based on a very specific terminology.",

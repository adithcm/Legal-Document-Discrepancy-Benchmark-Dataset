                "explanation": "In section 4, the responsibilities are divided across different entities: 'Company', 'Firm', 'Business', and 'Corporation'. 'The Company' pays the 'Base Fee', however, 'The Firm' is responsible to deliver the installments. Later 'The Business' elects to market the products, however, 'The Corporation' is responsible for calculating the royalty if the agreement is not renewed. It creates ambiguity as to which entity is ultimately responsible for fulfilling payment obligations.",

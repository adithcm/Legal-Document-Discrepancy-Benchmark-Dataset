Definitions.           ----------\n\n          1.1  \"Ancillary Agreements\" shall mean the following agreements between Inktomi and Microsoft, and all amended versions thereof or successor agreements thereto: (i) the Software Development Agreement of even date herewith; (ii) the Information Services Agreement of even date herewith; (iii) the Loan Agreement of even date herewith, and any and all \"Promissory Notes\" and/or \"New Note\" executed pursuant thereto; (iv) the Security Agreement of even date herewith; and (v) the Escrow Agreement of even date herewith.",

The contract now uses different terms (e.g., 'Information Services Agreement' vs. 'Information Services Contract,' 'Loan Agreement' vs. 'Credit Agreement') without clarifying if they are the same agreements, leading to potential disputes about which obligations apply.",

Payment For Services.           --------------------\n\n          4.1  As full and complete remittance for the Services, Microsoft shall tender to Inktomi the following monthly charges:\n\n               (a)  beginning with the Launch Milestone, the sum of [*] [*] Dollars ($[*]) (attributable to the use during the Duration of the Hosting Systems possessed by Inktomi as of the Effective Initiation), provided that in no event will Microsoft be obligated to make more than [*] ([*]) monthly charges pursuant to this clause (a), and if the Duration extends beyond [*] years after the Launch Milestone, this clause (a) will be deemed deleted from this Agreement effective on the [*] anniversary of the Launch Milestone notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein;\n\n               (b)  an amount equal to [*] ([*]) of the [*], [*], [*], [*] thereon, incurred by Inktomi to acquire each new Hosting System required to service Microsoft's needs in accordance with Section 3.1 above (attributable to the use during the Duration of such new Hosting Systems); such charges will commence with respect to each new Hosting System at such time as Inktomi's reimbursement duties begin with respect to such new Hosting",
                "explanation": "Changing key terms like 'compensation' to 'remittance,' 'fees' to 'charges,' 'Launch Date' to 'Launch Milestone,' 'Term' to 'Duration,' and 'Servers' to 'Systems' creates ambiguity. It becomes unclear if these different terms have the same meaning, affecting how the payment obligations are interpreted and potentially leading to disputes about payment amounts and schedules.",

For purposes of this Agreement, an \"transfer\" under this Section shall be deemed to include, without limitation, the following: (a) a merger or any other combination of an entity with another party (other than a reincorporation of Inktomi from the State of California to the State of Delaware), whether or not the entity is the surviving entity; (b) any transaction or series of transactions whereby a third party acquires direct or indirect power to control the management and policies of an entity, whether through the acquisition of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise; (c) in the case of Inktomi, the sale or other transfer of Inktomi's search engine business or any other substantial portion of Inktomi's assets (whether in a single transaction or series of transactions), or (d) the transfer of any rights or obligations in the course of a liquidation or other similar reorganization of an entity (other than a reincorporation of Inktomi from the State of California to the State of Delaware). Neither party will unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to a requested transfer, assignment or sublicense.

For purposes of this Agreement, a \"transfer\" under this Section shall be deemed to include, without limitation, the following: (a) a unification or any other consolidation of an entity with another participant (other than a reincorporation of Inktomi from the State of California to the State of Delaware), whether or not the entity is the surviving entity; (b) any transaction or series of transactions whereby a third party acquires direct or indirect power to dictate the direction and strategies of an entity, whether through the acquisition of voting instruments, by agreement, or otherwise; (c) in the case of Inktomi, the sale or other transfer of Inktomi's search engine business or any other significant fraction of Inktomi's holdings (whether in a single transaction or series of transactions), or (d) the transfer of any rights or responsibilities in the course of a wind-up or other similar restructuring of an entity (other than a reincorporation of Inktomi from the State of California to the State of Delaware).

                "explanation": "Substituting 'transfer' with 'conveyance,' 'cede,' or 'permit', 'assign' with 'cede', 'sublicense' with 'permit', 'agreement' with 'assent', 'combination' with 'unification or consolidation,' 'assets' with 'holdings', 'policies' with 'strategies,' and 'obligations' with 'responsibilities' introduces semantic confusion. The original clause aimed to restrict specific actions with clear legal implications; however, the replacements cloud the intent and could lead to varied interpretations of what activities are prohibited, thereby weakening enforcement.",

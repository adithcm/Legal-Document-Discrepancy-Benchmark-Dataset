Upon the expiration of the Term, the Term shall automatically extend for successive 12-month periods until one Party terminates the Agreement by providing at least 180 days prior written notice to the other Party prior to the expiration of the then-current term or unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the fifth (5t h) anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Duration”), unless the Agreement is sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the expiration of the Term, the Agreement shall automatically extend for successive 12-month periods until one Party terminates the Agreement by providing at least 180 days prior written notice to the other Party prior to the expiration of the then-current term or unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The key term is “Term”. By replacing “Term” with \"Duration\" in the first sentence, and keeping \"Term\" in the second sentence, an internal contradiction is created, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. While the intention is to refer to the contract's duration, the inconsistent use of both terms leads to a conflict on how long the agreement lasts.",

                "explanation": "The key term is \"Term.\" Replacing \"Term\" with \"Agreement\" creates a contradiction. While both terms refer to the overarching contract, the substitution makes it unclear if the licensing rights extend for the entire duration of the agreement or some subset thereof. This ambiguity impacts the value of the licensed patents and technical information to Eutectix, raising questions on the enforceability of the royalty agreement.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'Product' with 'Deliverable', the nature of Eutectix's obligations becomes ambiguous. Is Eutectix providing a warranty for the manufactured 'Product' or merely 'Deliverable' which creates a uncertainty on the liability and scope of Eutectix's responsibility. It may be challenged whether conformance to specifications applies only to the final act of delivering the good rather than the entire manufacturing process.",

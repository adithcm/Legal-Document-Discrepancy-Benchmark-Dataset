This perturbation changes the collective term to 'Participants', creating confusion as to whether 'Parties' and 'Participants' are interchangeable and if all obligations apply equally to both.",

If Party B obtains any Intellectual Property Asset in respect of the Program Content during its  use of the same, Party B shall notify Party A and, upon its request in writing, sign all documents and take all actions required to assign  such Intellectual Property to Party A, and ensure the Intellectual Property Asset so obtained by Party A is legitimate, complete,  and free from any encumbrance.",
                "explanation": "The contract uses the term 'Intellectual Property Right'. This perturbation modifies the text to use 'Intellectual Property' and 'Intellectual Property Asset' seemingly interchangeably, without defining 'Intellectual Property Asset'. This introduces ambiguity as it's unclear if they both cover the same scope of rights, leading to potential disputes over the transfer and protection of these undefined assets.",

                "explanation": "The contract uses the term 'force majeure' to describe events excusing performance. This perturbation changes 'Party' to 'Participant', and 'force majeure' to 'unforeseeable circumstances' in the beginning of the clause without defining what constitutes 'unforeseeable circumstances'. This raises the question of whether all force majeure events are 'unforeseeable circumstances' under the contract, potentially limiting or expanding the scope of excused performance.",

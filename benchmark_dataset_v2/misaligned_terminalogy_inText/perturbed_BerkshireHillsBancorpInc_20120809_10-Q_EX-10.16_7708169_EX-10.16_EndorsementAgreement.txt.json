                "explanation": "Replacing 'Berkshire' with 'Berkshire Financial Institution' creates uncertainty. While it may seem like they are the same, the agreement never defines 'Berkshire Financial Institution'. This raises the question of whether disparagement of other Berkshire entities (e.g., Berkshire Insurance Group, Inc. mentioned earlier) would also trigger termination rights. It is never explicitly stated which creates internal contradictions.",

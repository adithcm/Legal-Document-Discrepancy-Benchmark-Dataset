In Section 4(a), the term 'Updates' is used to describe bug fixes, error corrections, and maintenance updates of the Service. By changing it to 'Modifications,' and not defining 'Modifications,' it is now unclear if the Company is obligated to provide the same level of bug fixes and error corrections that it was previously obligated to provide under 'Updates,' creating a contradiction and possible dispute.",

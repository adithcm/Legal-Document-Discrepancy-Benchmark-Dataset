                "explanation": "The contract introduces 'vendor' for DIALOG instead of 'supplier,' and 'provider' for ENERGOUS, even though both companies are fulfilling similar roles. This creates ambiguity because 'vendor' and 'supplier' could suggest different levels of responsibility or contractual obligations, and same with 'provider' and 'supplier'.",

                "changed_text": "1.21 \"Products\" means the ENERGOUS inventory set forth in  Exhibit A, as such Exhibit may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement between the parties, that have been released by ENERGOUS to production, including all Product Updates, which will be deemed to have been added to Exhibit A automatically, without any further action required by the parties, immediately following the release to production date.",
                "explanation": "The contract replaces \"products\" with \"inventory\". This causes contradiction and uncertainty, as inventory refers to items a business intends to sell to customers, whereas products may refer to any output of a business. It could lead to disputes over whether certain items are meant for sale, evaluation, or internal use.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Products' and 'Product Die' are replaced with 'Items' and 'Item Die', and 'Product Specifications' is replaced with 'Component Specifications.' It is unclear whether Products/Product Die and Items/Item Die are intended to mean the same thing, or whether Component Specifications are the same as Product Specifications. This can cause issues regarding the scope of the warranty, what is being warranted, and compliance with specifications.",

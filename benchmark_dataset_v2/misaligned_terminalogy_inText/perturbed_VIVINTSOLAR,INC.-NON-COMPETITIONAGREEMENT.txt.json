                "explanation": "Changing \"Term\" to \"Duration\" when referencing the length of the agreement, while still using \"Term\" in the quoted section referring to the Sales Dealer Agreement introduces confusion.

                "explanation": "Replacing “Master Framework Agreement” with “Governing Law” changes the entire focus of Section 5. In the original text, the framework agreement governs the terms of the current agreement. Replacing Master Framework Agreement by governing law makes the reader uncertain what laws govern the current agreement. This creates a contradiction between this clause and potentially other jurisdiction clauses elsewhere (if there are any).",

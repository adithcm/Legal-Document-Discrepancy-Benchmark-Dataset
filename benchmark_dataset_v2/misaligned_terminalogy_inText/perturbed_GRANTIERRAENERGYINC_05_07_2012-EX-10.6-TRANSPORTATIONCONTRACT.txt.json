                "explanation": "Interchanging 'SENDER' with 'SHIPPER' causes confusion because the contract inconsistently refers to Solana Petroleum Exploration Colombia Limited as both SENDER and SHIPPER, leading to uncertainty regarding which party bears the responsibilities assigned to each term. This could lead to disputes regarding performance and liability.",

It is the responsibility of the SENDER to execute or contract these services whenever it may be  necessary. The SENDER shall wave and hold ECOPETROL harmless for any damage or prejudice suffered by ECOPETROL as a result of  failing to receive the Crude in the Exit Point, either by lack of the services before mentioned or by failing to provide the appropriate  facilities for such purpose.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'SENDER' to 'SHIPPER' in section 1.3 creates confusion by implying that ECOPETROL's obligations are tied to a different party, while section 1.4 holds 'SENDER' responsible. This inconsistency raises questions about which entity is entitled to receive transportation services, leading to potential contractual breaches.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Transporter' to 'Pipeline Operator' and 'Sender' to 'Shipper' introduces undefined terms that conflict with their established use elsewhere in the contract and manual.

                "explanation": "The terms 'Transporter' and 'Shipper' are replaced with 'Carrier' and 'Customer' respectively, without changing the subsequent references to 'Transporter' and 'Shipper' in the agreement. This creates ambiguity regarding the roles and responsibilities of each party, potentially leading to disputes about which entity is bound by which obligations.",

Any limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery shall be as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 DELIVERY VOLUME - shall mean the estimated daily quantity of gas which Transporter intends to receive and transport, subject to market conditions, for the benefit of Shipper, which shall be approximately 51,000 dekatherms. Specific limitations are outlined in Addendum 'A'.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Transportation Quantity' is replaced with 'Delivery Volume,' changing the commitment from a firm agreement to a market-dependent intention, while also changing the attached exhibit from Exhibit A to Addendum A. This directly contradicts the original firm obligation of the Transporter to receive and transport gas, making the enforcement of a guaranteed quantity uncertain. It also alters the place for reviewing limitations.",

The failure to specify which tariff and articles payment terms can be found, which creates ambiguity as to the source of the payment terms, undermining the enforceability of the payment obligations.

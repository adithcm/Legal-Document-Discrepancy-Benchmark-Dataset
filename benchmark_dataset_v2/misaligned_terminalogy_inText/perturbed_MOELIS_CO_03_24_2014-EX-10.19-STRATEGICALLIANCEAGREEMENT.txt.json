Within 60 days after Moelis Holdings receives a written notice to register the Registrable Securities, Moelis Holdings will file a Registration Statement, on an appropriate form, to register the sale of the Registrable Securities, which Registration Statement will (if specified in the SMBC Unit-Holders' notice) contemplate the ability of the SMBC Unit-Holders to effect an Underwritten Offering (the \"Demand Registration\"). The Demand Notice shall specify the intended method of distribution of the Registrable Securities. Subject to Section 13.2, Moelis Holdings may include in any registration effected pursuant to this Section 13.1 any securities for its own account or for the account of holders (other than the SMBC Unit-Holders) of Partnership Interests; provided, that, Moelis Holdings shall pay a portion of all expenses of Moelis Holdings (including those set forth in Section 13.8) in connection with any such registration, in proportion to the aggregate selling price of all securities so included in any such registration.",

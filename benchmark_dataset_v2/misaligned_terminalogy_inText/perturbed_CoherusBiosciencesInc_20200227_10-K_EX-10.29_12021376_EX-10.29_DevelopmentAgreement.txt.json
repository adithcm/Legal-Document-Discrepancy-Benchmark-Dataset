                "original_text": "1.9 Commercially Reasonable Efforts means, with respect to the efforts to be used by a Party under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Products, those efforts and resources normally used by a major pharmaceutical or a sufficiently financed biotechnology company for a product owned by it, or to which it has rights, which is of similar market potential at comparable stages of development, taking into account the competitiveness of the marketplace, the proprietary position of the product, the performance of other products that are of similar market potential and the likely timing of other product's entry into the market, the regulatory structure involved, the profitability of the applicable product, relevant Third Party intellectual property necessary to manufacture or Commercialize the Licensed Product and other relevant factors commonly considered in similar circumstances, including technical, legal, scientific or medical factors.",
                "changed_text": "1.9 Commercially Acceptable Efforts means, with respect to the efforts to be used by a Party under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Products, those efforts and resources deemed appropriate by the Party, irrespective of industry standards or market conditions. The term shall be interpreted to mean any level of effort, even if minimal, that the Party believes is sufficient.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' using an objective standard tied to industry norms. The modified version, using the term 'Commercially Acceptable Efforts,' introduces a subjective standard where the party determines the level of effort. This creates a contradiction, as one section implies a high standard and the other allows for minimal effort.",

For clarity, Licensed Products include without limitation Vial Products and PFS Products, and shall extend to any New Products to the extent this Agreement is amended in accordance with Section 3.4",
                "changed_text": "1.39 Licensed Asset means the active pharmaceutical ingredient Ranibizumab, in any form, including bulk drug substance, whether or not incorporated into a finished dosage form. For clarity, Licensed Assets do not include finished dosage forms, Vial Products, or PFS Products, and specifically exclude any New Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Licensed Product' as finished dosage forms, including vials and prefilled syringes. The modified version, using 'Licensed Asset,' redefines it as solely the active ingredient and explicitly excludes finished forms. This leads to a contradiction concerning which items the license covers, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

For clarity, Commercialization does not include any Development activities, whether conducted before or after Regulatory Approval. \"Commercialize\" and \"Commercializing\" have correlative meanings.",

The modified version defines 'Distribution' as solely the physical movement of the product, excluding all commercial and marketing activities.

Now therefore, the parties mutually agree to enter into a strategic alliance under the following terms and conditions:   1) Responsibilities of Bravatek   Bravatek agrees to serve as a non-exclusive project sales contact for Fazync. In this capacity, Bravatek will reasonably endeavor to provide the following services to Fazync",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Duties' to 'Responsibilities' and 'best efforts' to 'reasonably endeavor' weakens Bravatek's obligation. 'Sales lead finder' is also changed to 'sales contact', further reducing Bravatek's commitment. This creates uncertainty regarding the level of effort Bravatek is required to exert and the specific role they play in lead generation. Are 'responsibilities' legally enforceable like 'duties'?",

                "original_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and delivered through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by Fazync at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at Fazync bank account.",
                "changed_text": "For any Offering or Capability sold to any potential customers identified by Bravatek communicated with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and provided through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution partner(s) or sales method(s), Bravatek will receive a commission, to be unilaterally determined by Fazync at the rate of between 10% and 20% of project revenue, with the precise commission dependent upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, remitted 45 days after each client payment on delivered products deposited into Fazync bank account.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Product or Solution' with 'Offering or Capability,' 'perspective clients' with 'potential customers,' 'delivered' with 'provided,' 'lead-finder fee' with 'commission,' 'mutually discussed and finally decided by Fazync' with 'unilaterally determined by Fazync,' 'payable NET 30 days' with 'remitted 45 days', and 'received at' with 'deposited into' significantly alters the terms of compensation. It gives Fazync unilateral control over the fee amount and extends the payment period, contradicting the original agreement of mutual agreement. This also introduces ambiguity regarding the definition of 'Offering' and 'Capability'.",

                "original_text": "Bravatek shall indemnify Fazync, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of Bravatek or breach of Bravatek of any of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Bravatek may reimburse Fazync, its executives, personnel and workers, for certain losses, charges, expenditures, and other debts, including customary legal fees and litigation expenses, sustained with any third-party assertion, suit or case resulting from the gross negligence or willful wrongdoing of Bravatek or violation by Bravatek of certain of its stipulations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Substituting 'shall indemnify' with 'may reimburse' shifts the obligation from mandatory to discretionary, 'directors, officers and employees' with 'executives, personnel and workers' broadens the scope but also adds ambiguity as to who is covered, 'damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities' with 'losses, charges, expenditures, and other debts' introduces vagueness, 'reasonable attorney's fees and court costs' with 'customary legal fees and litigation expenses' is less precise, 'negligence or intentional misconduct' with 'gross negligence or willful wrongdoing' raises the threshold for triggering indemnification, and 'any of its obligations' with 'certain of its stipulations' limits the scope of obligations covered. This significantly weakens Fazync's protection, and uses varying language to do so, which introduces uncertainty and contradiction.",

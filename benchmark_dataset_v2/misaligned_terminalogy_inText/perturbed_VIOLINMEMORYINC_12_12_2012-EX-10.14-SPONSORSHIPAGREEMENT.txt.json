The term 'control' means the possession of the power to direct the management and policies of the person or entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",

The term 'control' may mean the ability to influence the decisions of the person or entity, through any form of agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"control\" provides a specific mechanism for determining control (ownership of voting securities, contract). The modified definition broadens this, making it unclear what constitutes \"control\" and creates an internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed \"Sponsorship Fee\". The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the fee \"will generally be\" USD $4,000,000.00, but adding \"unless mutually agreed upon.\" This allows for the fee to be changed without a formal amendment, creating uncertainty and contradiction.",

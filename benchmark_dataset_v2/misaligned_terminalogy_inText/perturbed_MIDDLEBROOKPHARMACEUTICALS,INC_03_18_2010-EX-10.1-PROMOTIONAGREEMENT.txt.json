                "original_text": "(u)   \"Promotion Fees\" means the Promotion Fees payable to DD by MBRK for the promotion services provided under  this Agreement as is calculated by and stipulated in Section 5, which represent fair market value for such services.",
                "changed_text": "(u)   \"Promotion Fees\" means the consideration payable to DD by MBRK for the marketing activities provided under this Agreement as described in Section 5, which represent a cost reimbursement.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'Promotion Fees represent fair market value for such services' to 'consideration represents a cost reimbursement' creates a contradiction in the nature of the payment. Fair market value implies a profit margin, while cost reimbursement suggests DD is only being repaid for expenses.",

DD agrees that it shall not  directly or indirectly offer, pay or transfer anything of value, in cash or in-kind, to induce DD Target Segment Prescribers  to purchase, order, or recommend MOXATAG, nor shall DD exert undue influence on the medical decision-making of  DD Target Segment Prescribers.",
                "changed_text": "3.5 DD shall use commercially reasonable endeavors to market MOXATAG to DD Target Segment Prescribers and agrees to efficiently perform the obligations as described in EXHIBIT 4 in compliance with MBRK's guidelines and procedures, and all relevant federal and state legislation and rules, including, but not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback laws, rules contained in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) as they relate to advertising activity of an FDA-approved pharmaceutical product and the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's (\"OIG\") Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (2003). DD agrees that it shall not directly or indirectly offer, pay or transfer anything of value, in cash or in-kind, to encourage DD Target Segment Prescribers to prescribe, order, or suggest MOXATAG, nor shall DD exert undue influence on the medical decision-making of DD Target Segment Prescribers.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'commercially reasonable efforts' to 'commercially reasonable endeavors', 'policies and procedures' to 'guidelines and procedures', 'laws and regulations' to 'legislation and rules', and 'purchase, order, or recommend' to 'prescribe, order, or suggest' introduces subtly different interpretations of the obligations. While the intent might appear similar, the legal weight and scope of these terms differ, potentially leading to disputes over the exact responsibilities of DD. This also increases uncertainty because 'promote' and 'market' are used, despite marketing being more general than promotion.",

                "original_text": "Section 7 — Independent Contractor\n\nIn the performance of DD's obligations under this Agreement, DD shall at all times act as and be deemed an  independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to render DD or any of its employees, agents, or  officers, an employee, joint venturer, agent, or partner of MBRK. As an independent contractor, DD fees and expenses  are limited to those expressly stated in this Agreement. DD is not authorized to assume or create any obligations or  responsibilities, express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of MBRK, except as specifically defined herein. It is understood that the employees, methods, facilities, and equipment of DD shall at all times be under DD's exclusive  direction and control. DD shall not participate in MBRK's fringe benefit plans or any other compensation or benefit plans  MBRK maintains for its own employees.",
                "changed_text": "Section 7 — Service Provider\n\nIn the performance of DD's commitments under this Agreement, DD shall at all times act as and be considered a service provider. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to make DD or any of its personnel, representatives, or executives, an employee, joint venturer, representative, or affiliate of MBRK. As a service provider, DD fees and expenses are capped to those clearly stated in this Agreement. DD is not entitled to assume or establish any obligations or liabilities, explicit or implicit, on behalf of or in the name of MBRK, except as particularly outlined herein. It is recognized that the personnel, methods, facilities, and equipment of DD shall at all times be under DD's sole direction and supervision. DD shall not participate in MBRK's perks plans or any other remuneration or welfare schemes MBRK maintains for its own personnel.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Independent Contractor' with 'Service Provider' changes the nature of the relationship, implying potentially more control from MBRK. Furthermore, using synonyms such as 'commitments' for 'obligations', 'personnel' for 'employees', 'representatives' for 'agents', 'executives' for 'officers', 'interpreted' for 'construed', 'affiliate' for 'partner', 'capped' for 'limited', 'entitled' for 'authorized', 'liabilities' for 'responsibilities', 'explicit' for 'express', 'implicit' for 'implied', 'particularly outlined' for 'specifically defined', 'recognized' for 'understood', 'sole direction and supervision' for 'exclusive direction and control', 'perks plans' for 'fringe benefit plans', 'remuneration or welfare schemes' for 'compensation or benefit plans', and 'personnel' for 'employees' introduces inconsistent terminology to describe core aspects of the agreement, potentially creating ambiguity regarding the extent of DD's independence and MBRK's control.",

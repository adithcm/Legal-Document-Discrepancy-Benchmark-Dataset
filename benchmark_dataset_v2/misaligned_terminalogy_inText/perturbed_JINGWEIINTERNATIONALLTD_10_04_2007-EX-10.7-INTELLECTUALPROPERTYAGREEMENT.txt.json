                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party A agrees to license the non- exclusive right to use the intellectual property pursuant to this Agreement to Party B in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein and Party B agrees to accept the right to use the intellectual property on the same terms and conditions set forth herein.",
                "changed_text": "Party A agrees to license the non- exclusive right to use the intellectual property pursuant to this Agreement to Party B in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein and Party B agrees to accept the privilege to use the intellectual property on different terms and guidelines specified by Party A.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Party B accepts the right to use the intellectual property on the same terms and conditions. The modified version replaces 'right' with 'privilege' and states 'different terms and guidelines specified by Party A,' creating a contradiction and making the agreement unenforceable as the 'same terms' conflicts with 'different terms'.",

                "original_text": "Party B agrees to pay Party A the Intellectual Property License fees (the \"License Fees\") and the specified amount of the license fees and the form of payment are set forth in Appendix 2. Party A has the right to exempt the obligation of payment or adjust the amount of the License Fees set forth in Appendix 2 according to the actual circumstances from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "Party B agrees to provide financial remuneration to Party A for the Intellectual Property permission (the \"License Fees\"), the cost is to be determined by Party A. Party A retains the discretion to waive payment requirements or change the financial remuneration listed as well as not listed in Appendix 2 based on future considerations.",
                "explanation": "The original text refers to 'Intellectual Property License fees', which is modified to 'financial remuneration'. 'specified amount' is now 'cost to be determined by Party A'. This change gives Party A complete discretion over the cost, contradicting the idea of a pre-agreed fee structure in Appendix 2, thus introducing conflict.",

                "original_text": "Without prejudice to any legal or other rights or remedies of the party who asks for termination of this Agreement, any Party has the right to terminate this Agreement immediately with written notice to the other party in the event the other party materially breaches this Agreement including but not limited to the obligation under Article 3 of this Agreement and fails to cure its breach within thirty (30) days from the date it receives written notice of its breach from the non-breaching party. During the term of this Agreement, Party A may terminate this Agreement at any time with a written notice to Party B 30 days before such termination.",
                "changed_text": "Without limiting any legal or equitable rights or remedies available to the terminating side of this agreement, either Party may end this understanding instantly by informing the other side if they significantly violate this Agreement, particularly obligations in Article 3, and don't fix the violation within a month after getting a notice. Furthermore, Party A can end this deal whenever with 30 days' notice.",
                "explanation": "The modified text uses 'end this understanding' instead of 'terminate this agreement', 'terminating side' instead of 'party who asks for termination of this agreement', 'equitable rights' instead of 'legal rights', 'side' instead of 'party', and 'deal' instead of 'agreement'. By changing the wording this way it introduces inconsistency and ambiguity, especially the phrases 'legal or equitable rights' in place of 'legal rights', which is now up to interpretation. ",

If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "MAINTENANCE OF SOLVENCY. This provision applies only to benefits provided through the General Account. If the solvency of Thrivent Financial for Lutherans becomes impaired, you may be required to provide additional funds. The Executive Committee will determine the amount of any required contribution. It will be based on a calculation they deem appropriate. You may satisfy this obligation through an equivalent reduction in benefits, a payment in cash, or any method deemed acceptable by the Society. If you do not satisfy this obligation within 30 days from the date we notify you, the amount will be considered a loan against the contract with interest calculated at the prevailing market rate.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Society' is replaced with 'Thrivent Financial for Lutherans,' 'extra payment' is replaced with 'additional funds' and 'required contribution,' 'Board of Directors' is replaced with 'Executive Committee,' 'member's fair share of the deficiency' is replaced with 'a calculation they deem appropriate', the payment period is reduced from 60 to 30 days, 'indebtedness' is replaced with 'loan', and the interest rate is changed from a fixed 5% to the 'prevailing market rate.' These changes introduce uncertainty about the calculation method, responsible party, and acceptable forms of payment, creating an internal contradiction and making the enforcement unclear.",

Also introducing a condition to economic conditions and company performance. While the original text discusses dividends based on a divisible surplus, the modified text introduces the concept of 'rewards' based on company profits and subject to company discretion. This contradicts the original expectation that no dividends would be credited by stating that rewards are possible but not guaranteed and depend on factors outside the contract's provisions, thereby creating an internal contradiction regarding potential financial benefits.",

In no event will Agent be liable for special, indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if Agent has been advised of the possibility of such losses or damages and regardless of the form of action.",

The modified text uses 'Service Provider' and 'Transfer Agent' to refer to the same entity, creating ambiguity and potentially conflicting interpretations of liability. The term Contract is also used intead of Agreement, which adds to the contradiction.",

                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Tallgrass Energy, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or guideline thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Tallgrass Energy, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Exchange Act' to 'Act' and 'rule or regulation' to 'rule or guideline' creates ambiguity. While it might seem minor, 'Act' is not defined, and guidelines are generally non-binding, while regulations are legally binding. This introduces uncertainty about the legal force of the filings.",

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each entity is responsible for the prompt submission of such filings and any modifications thereto, and for the correctness and reliability of the details concerning such entity contained therein; however, no party is liable for the correctness or reliability of the information concerning the other parties participating in the submission, unless such party is aware or has reason to suspect that such information is flawed.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Each of them' to 'Each entity,' 'timely filing' to 'prompt submission,' 'amendments' to 'modifications,' 'completeness and accuracy' to 'correctness and reliability,' 'person' to 'entity,' 'none of them is responsible' to 'no party is liable,' 'other persons making the filing' to 'other parties participating in the submission,' 'knows or has reason to believe' to 'is aware or has reason to suspect,' and 'inaccurate' to 'flawed.' This introduces ambiguity by using weaker terms like 'reliability' and 'suspect,' making the standard of responsibility less clear and harder to enforce.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This understanding shall remain fully operational until terminated by any signatory herein via a written notification delivered to all other signatories herein, exclusively affecting the terminating signatory.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Agreement' to 'understanding,' 'full force and effect' to 'fully operational,' 'revoked' to 'terminated,' 'party' to 'signatory,' 'signed writing' to 'written notification,' and 'each other party hereto' to 'all other signatories herein.' This weakens the binding nature of the agreement by using 'understanding' instead of 'agreement,' potentially suggesting a non-legally binding arrangement and 'fully operational' does not carry the same legal weight as 'full force and effect'.",

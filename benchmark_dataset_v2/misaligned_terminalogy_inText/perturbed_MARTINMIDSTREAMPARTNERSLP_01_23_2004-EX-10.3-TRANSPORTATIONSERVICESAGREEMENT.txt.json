                "original_text": "During the Term, Charterer agrees that Owner will be the sole and exclusive provider of marine transportation services for #2 fuel oil and high sulfur diesel owned by Charterer or owned by others and in transit for sale to Charterer so long as Owner has the required equipment available. Owner shall at all times provide sufficient and proper equipment for Charterer's performance of such transportation. Said equipment shall be manned, equipped, supplied and operated by Owner. The master and crew of said vessels shall be fully qualified, experience and, where necessary, certified and licensed. Owner agrees that said equipment shall be maintained in a seaworthy, staunch, tight and suitable condition and, to the best of Owner's knowledge, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, the Customer agrees that the Vendor will be the sole and exclusive provider of marine transportation services for #2 fuel oil and high sulfur diesel owned by the Customer or owned by others and in transit for sale to the Customer so long as the Vendor has the required equipment available. The Vendor shall at all times endeavor to provide sufficient equipment for Customer's performance of such transportation. Said equipment shall be operated by the Vendor. The Vendor shall ensure the master and crew of said vessels are qualified and experienced. The Vendor agrees that said equipment shall be maintained in a suitable condition and in compliance with all applicable regulations.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Charterer' to 'Customer' and 'Owner' to 'Vendor' creates ambiguity regarding the parties' roles. Additionally, changing 'sufficient and proper equipment' to 'endeavor to provide sufficient equipment' weakens Vendor's obligation. Removing 'manned, equipped, supplied' removes Vendor's obligation. Finally, removing the words 'seaworthy, staunch, tight' weakens the standards that the Vendor must comply with.",

                "explanation": "Changing Owner to Vendor is an example of misaligned terminology. Furthermore, the insurance coverage requirements are lowered from $500,000,000 to $10,000,000.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Charterer's representatives' to 'Customer's designated individuals' and 'vessel' to 'transportation vehicles' creates a weaker, more ambiguous right of inspection. 'Owner' is changed to 'Vendor.' Additionally, removing 'logs and certificates' and replacing it with 'verify compliance by the Vendor' reduces the scope of inspection and adds ambiguity.",

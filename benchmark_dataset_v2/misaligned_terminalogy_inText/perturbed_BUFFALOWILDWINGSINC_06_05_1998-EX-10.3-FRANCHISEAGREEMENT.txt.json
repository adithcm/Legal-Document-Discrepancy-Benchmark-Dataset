                "original_text": "You will maintain during the term of this Agreement, and preserve for the time period specified by us, full, complete, and accurate books, records, and accounts in accordance with the standard accounting system prescribed by us from time to time in writing.  You will retain for a period of three (3) years all books and records related to the Franchised Restaurant, including without limitation, sales checks, purchase orders, invoices, payroll records, customer lists, check stubs, sales tax records and returns, cash receipts and disbursement journals and general ledgers.",
                "changed_text": "You will maintain during the term of this Agreement, and preserve for the time period specified by us, full, complete, and accurate books, records, and accounts in accordance with the standard accounting system prescribed by us from time to time in writing. You will retain for the duration of this Agreement all business documents related to the Franchised Restaurant, including without limitation, sales checks, purchase orders, invoices, payroll records, customer lists, check stubs, sales tax records and returns, cash receipts and disbursement journals and general ledgers.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a retention period of 'three (3) years', while the modified text states retention 'for the duration of this Agreement'. This creates an internal contradiction regarding how long the franchisee is legally obligated to keep these records. It also replaces the term books and records with business documents which is vagues and broadens the scope of documents to be retained.",

Your designation of a general manager shall be subject to our prior written approval, and shall further be subject to the designated general manager successfully completing our training course.  All costs for the attendance of the designated general manager at our training course shall be at your cost, except as set forth in Section IV(A).  We will have the right at any time to revoke our approval of a designated manager.  The use of a general manager will in no way relieve you of your obligations to observe, perform and comply with this Agreement and the Manuals and to insure that the Franchised Restaurant is properly managed and operated or the responsibility for the on-site, day to day operation of the Franchised Restaurant.",

Your designation of a supervisor shall be subject to our prior written approval, and shall further be subject to the designated supervisor successfully completing our training course.  All costs for the attendance of the designated supervisor at our training course shall be at your cost, except as set forth in Section IV(A).

                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'general manager' with 'supervisor,' implying different roles. However, the contradiction arises when the original text states that using a 'general manager' does NOT relieve the franchisee of their obligations, while the modified text states that a 'supervisor' WILL relieve them of certain obligations, creating a conflict.",

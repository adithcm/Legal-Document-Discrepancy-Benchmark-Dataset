                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(kk) \"Assigned Other IP\" means all of the Intellectual Property (other than Copyrights, Know-How, Patents, and Software), if any, owned by any Seller Party as of the Initial Closing Date that was created by a Business Employee, including the Trademarks and other Intellectual Property set forth on Schedule 1.1(k)(i), but for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the Trademarks set forth on Schedule 1.1(k)(ii).",
                "changed_text": "(kk) \"Assigned Other IP\" refers to select Intellectual Properties (excluding Copyrights, Know-How, Patents and Software) owned by the Seller on the Closing Date, explicitly including Trademarks listed on Schedule 1.1(k)(i), and also encompassing those Trademarks listed on Schedule 1.1(k)(ii). Any exclusion of properties requires mutual written consent from all parties.",
                "explanation": "The original definition excludes trademarks set forth on Schedule 1.1(k)(ii). The modified definition now includes these trademarks, creating a direct contradiction. The added requirement for written consent to exclude properties adds a condition that was absent originally, thus creating ambiguity on what is to be assigned under 'Assigned Other IP.'",

                "changed_text": "(www) \"Purchaser Limited Products\" may refer to (i) Infrastructure Equipment, (ii) Mobile Radio Products, (iii) certain Software and Solutions, or (iv) designated Field Products. The specific items considered 'Purchaser Limited Products' will be determined by mutual agreement between the Seller and Purchaser, with a listing to be appended to this agreement within 30 days of the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a clear categorization of 'Purchaser Excluded Products.' The modified version changes the terminology to 'Purchaser Limited Products', making it non-specific and subject to future agreement. This creates uncertainty as to which products are actually limited, potentially impacting the scope of the licenses granted to the purchaser. This also adds a clause for appending the list within 30 days, which, if not fulfilled, makes enforcement challenging.",

Each of the Seller Parties may grant sublicenses of the licenses granted to it pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d): (i) to any (for the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting any other provision of this IP Agreement, current or future) direct or indirect Subsidiary of Seller (but only for so long as such Person remains such a Subsidiary); (ii) to any other Person in connection with the sale or disposition of substantially all of the assets of a business or product line of any of the Seller Parties; (iii) other than with respect to Section 2.1(c), for the purpose of any Person's (including resellers, distributors, and OEMs) distribution of products licensed under Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d); (iv) other than with respect to Section 2.1(c), to any Person (including OEMs, JDMs, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors) solely for the purpose of, and to the extent necessary for, such Person to perform any service (including any service with respect to the design, manufacture, import, export, or supply of any product, service, or system in the Seller Business or any components thereof) for a Seller Party, and not for the direct benefit of such Person or any other Person, (v) other than with respect to Section 2.1(c), to a customer of a Seller Party for such customer's use of a product licensed under Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d); or (vi) other than with respect to Section 2.1(c), with respect to Software, to any Person for the purpose of such Person's development of Software that is compatible or interoperates with a product licensed under Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d). The Seller Parties have no other right to grant sublicenses under any of the licenses granted to the Seller Parties under this IP Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(f) Sublicenses. The Seller Parties are permitted to grant sublicenses for Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d), strictly limited to its direct subsidiaries. Any sublicense to third parties requires explicit written approval from Zebra Technologies, where Zebra can deny approval without any reason provided.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows a broader scope for sublicensing, including to subsidiaries, in connection with sale/disposition of assets, distributors, OEMs, suppliers, contractors, subcontractors, and customers. The modified text severely restricts this scope to only direct subsidiaries and introduces a requirement for written approval from Zebra for any third-party sublicenses, which Zebra can deny without providing a reason. This creates a contradiction as it directly conflicts with the previously defined permissible sublicensing actions.",

                "original_text": "Sandler O'Neill accepts such appointment and agrees to use its best efforts to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with any applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 'best efforts,' which legally means the highest standard of effort. Changing this to 'commercially reasonable efforts' significantly lowers the required standard, making the agent's obligation less stringent and creating a contradiction on the level of committment.",

INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n(a) The Company, the MHCs and the Bank, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, each person, if any, who controls the Agent, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and its respective partners, directors, officers, employees and agents as follows:\n\n(i) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, related to or arising out of the Offerings or any action taken by the Agent where acting as agent of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank or otherwise as described in Section 2 hereof;",

INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n(a) The Company, the MHCs and the Bank, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, each person, if any, who controls the Agent, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and its respective partners, directors, officers, employees and agents as follows:\n\n(i) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense directly related to or arising out of the Offerings or any action taken by the Agent where acting as agent of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank or otherwise as described in Section 2 hereof;",
                "explanation": "By changing 'any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, related to or arising out of the Offerings' to 'any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense directly related to or arising out of the Offerings' introduces a directness of causation requirement. The original text doesn't exclude losses that are indirectly related. This means the company is now indemnifying a narrower set of losses, creating conflicting interpretations of the scope of indemnification.",

The Company will file with the Nasdaq Global Market all documents and notices required by the Nasdaq Global Market of companies that have issued securities that are traded in the over-the-counter market and quotations for which are reported by the Nasdaq Global Market.",

The Company will file with the Nasdaq Global Market all documents and notices reasonably required by the Nasdaq Global Market of companies that have issued securities that are traded in the over-the-counter market and quotations for which are reported by the Nasdaq Global Market.",
                "explanation": "The initial obligation to use 'best efforts' is replaced with a lower standard of 'commercially reasonable efforts.' Furthermore, the absolute requirement to 'comply' is softened to 'endeavor to comply.' And 'required' to 'reasonably required'. These alterations introduce significant ambiguity and weaken the company's commitment to maintaining the listing and complying with governance standards. This creates a contradiction in the commitment to adhere to Nasdaq regulations.",

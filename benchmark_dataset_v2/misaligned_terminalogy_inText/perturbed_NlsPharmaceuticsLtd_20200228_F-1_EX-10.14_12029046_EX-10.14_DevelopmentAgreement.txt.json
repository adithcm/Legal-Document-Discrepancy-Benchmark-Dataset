                "changed_text": "Distributor shall mean a company appointed by Licensee in a country of the Territory for the import, selling, promotion and distribution of the Licensed Product in such country of the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the distributor must be agreed upon by the licensor and licensee. The modified text removes the requirement for the licensor to agree, which creates a contradiction as the licensor may not be aware of the Distributor.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Distributor' is replaced with 'Vendor'. As 'Vendor' is not defined in the agreement, it is unclear if 'Vendor' refers to the same entity as 'Distributor', which leads to potential confusion. This implies that the Licensee can extend rights to another party without clear definition or alignment with the existing definitions.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires that the Business Plan should be mutually agreed by both parties. The modified text now stipulates that 'The sales shall be at the sole discretion of Eurofarma' which creates a contradiction with the initial statement and undermines the purpose of both parties' agreement.",

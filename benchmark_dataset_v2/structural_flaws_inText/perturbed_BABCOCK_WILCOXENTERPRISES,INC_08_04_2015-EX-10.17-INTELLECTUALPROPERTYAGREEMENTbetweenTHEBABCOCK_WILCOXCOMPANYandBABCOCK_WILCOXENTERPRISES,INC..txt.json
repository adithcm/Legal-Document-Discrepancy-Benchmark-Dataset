The modified text introduces use limitations, namely the usage becomes `temporary, revocable, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, rights-limited right and license with the right to not grant sublicenses.` which contradicts the first statement and introduces uncertainty in the enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text presents a clear covenant not to sue. The added clause stating \"However, this covenant does not apply to acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct by SpinCo\" creates an exception to the covenant, thus contradicting the absolute nature of the original covenant. This introduces ambiguity and potential for disputes regarding what constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct, and whether such actions would negate the protection offered by the covenant not to sue.",

                "original_text": "MMI warrants providing the Services with due diligence and care in accordance\n\n\n\nwith the specifications set by Dragon Systems. Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 6 months from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims.",
                "changed_text": "MMI warrants providing the Services with due diligence and care in accordance\n\n\n\nwith the specifications set by Dragon Systems. Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 6 months from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to request re-performing the services and if MMI cannot or will not re-perform, Dragon Systems must accept the original services without compensation or claims. Dragon Systems will be required to make payment in full regardless of damages.",
                "explanation": "The original clause gives Dragon Systems several options if the services are not performed as agreed including refusal of payment. The new clause forces Dragon Systems to accept the original services and pay regardless, even if defective, directly contradicting the earlier options and warranty provided.",

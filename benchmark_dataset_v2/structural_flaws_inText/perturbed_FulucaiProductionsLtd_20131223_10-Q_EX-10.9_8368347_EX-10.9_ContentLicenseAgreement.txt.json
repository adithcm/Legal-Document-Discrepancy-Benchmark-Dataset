                "explanation": "The change in the Deal Terms reverses the primary License Term from 'Perpetual, unlimited runs' to '2 years'. While retaining the 'Other' clause with the perpetual term, the switch creates an immediate contradiction regarding the agreement's duration. The altered ordering diminishes the clarity on whether ConvergTV's license to distribute the Program is perpetual or limited to a two-year period, thus impacting the value of the license.",

The terms \"License Term\", \"Licensed Rights\", and \"Licensed Territory\" shall have the meaning specified in the Deal Terms above, which such Deal Terms are part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated herein by reference.",

The terms \"License Term\", \"Licensed Rights\", and \"Licensed Territory\" shall have the meaning specified in the Deal Terms above, which such Deal Terms are part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated herein by reference.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the 'unlimited runs' clause in Section 1(a) to a 'limited amount of runs'. This change creates direct conflict with the deal terms that say the License Term is Perpetual. This creates uncertainty about the nature of the rights licensed to ConvergTV. Is there a restriction on how many times the content can be broadcast and distributed or not?",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise agreed upon by the Producer in writing' to Section 4 undermines ConvergTV's exclusivity. While the original clause guarantees exclusive rights, the addition allows the Producer to unilaterally override this exclusivity through a written agreement, creating a potential conflict about who has the final say regarding the distribution rights during the License Term.",

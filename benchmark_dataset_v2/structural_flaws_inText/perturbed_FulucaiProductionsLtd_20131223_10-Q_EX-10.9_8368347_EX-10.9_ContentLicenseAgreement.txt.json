                "explanation": "The original text grants a license for \"unlimited runs\". The modified text changes this to a period determined at ConvergTV's discretion. This contradicts the original \"unlimited runs\" clause, creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the license.",

                "explanation": "The original text ensures exclusivity for ConvergTV during the License Term. The modified text adds 'During a period as determined at Producer's discretion' which allows the Producer to dictate the exclusivity period. This placement undermines ConvergTV's assumed exclusive rights, thus creating contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text says the Producer will indemnify ConvergTV for all cost, expenses, and damages as a direct or indirect result. The change modifies this to where the Producer only indemnifies in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. The original covers more use cases. It could be debated what happens if it's a mistake rather than gross negligence or willful misconduct. The edited text creates uncertainity.",

By providing written notice, a party may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within 15 days after receiving written notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.6  [Boxlot Content] or 12.7  [Force Majeure] or Exhibit B.  In addition, by providing written notice, theglobe may immediately terminate this Agreement, or at its option immediately suspend its promotion and other efforts hereunder, in the case of Boxlot's breach of Section 12.1  [Compliance with Laws].",
                "changed_text": "8.2  Termination for Failure to Perform.  By providing written notice, a party may terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party materially breaches this Agreement. The breaching party will have a reasonable time, as determined by the non-breaching party, to cure the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.6  [Boxlot Content] or 12.7  [Force Majeure] or Exhibit B.  In addition, by providing written notice, theglobe may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, without any impact on obligations in this agreement, in the case of Boxlot's breach of Section 12.1  [Compliance with Laws].",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 15-day cure period for material breaches. The modified text replaces this with a 'reasonable time, as determined by the non-breaching party,' introducing ambiguity. Additionally, the original text allows theglobe to 'immediately suspend its promotion and other efforts hereunder' upon Boxlot's breach of 12.1. The changed text states theglobe may terminate 'at any time with or without cause, without any impact on obligations in this agreement,' implying theglobe could continue to enforce obligations while terminating due to a different breach. This contradicts the explicit option to 'suspend efforts' in the original, which implies a temporary cessation of obligations/performance.",

Boxlot shall not introduce any advertising spots or third party branding in conjunction with the Co-Branded Pages or the Service without theglobe's approval.  If, after theglobe (or its designee) uses commercially reasonable efforts to sell such inventory, there remains unsold inventory, then theglobe may, in its sole discretion, place house or barter ads in such inventory.",
                "changed_text": "3.1  Ad Sales.  theglobe shall have initial control over advertising and promotion inventory on Co-Branded Pages, for a timeframe of one month after launch. Boxlot shall have control over a percentage, no less than 25%, of advertising spots or third party branding in conjunction with the Co-Branded Pages or the Service, with no pre-approval needed. theglobe will not place house or barter ads in such inventory.",
                "explanation": "In the original text, theglobe has 'sole control' over advertising. The modified version gives Boxlot control over a minimum of '25%' of advertising spots without pre-approval, directly contradicting the 'sole control' clause for theglobe. The new text also dictates theglobe cannot place house ads when the prior version states theglobe 'may in its sole discretion' do so.",

                "explanation": "In the original clause, liability is limited to the amount Boxlot actually pays theglobe. The modified clause changes this, limiting liability up to '50% of the market value of the company'. The 'market value' can greatly exceed the initial payment, so there is an internal contradiction.",

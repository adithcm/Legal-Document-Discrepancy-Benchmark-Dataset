The initial term of this Agreement commences as of the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to any express provision of this Agreement, shall continue until five (5) years following the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). Thereafter, this Agreement shall renew automatically for one (1) additional three (3) year period (the \"Renewal Term\" and collectively, together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\") unless either party provides the other with written notice of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days before the expiration of the Initial Term].",

The initial term of this Agreement commences as of the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to any express provision of this Agreement, shall continue until five (5) years following the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). Thereafter, this Agreement may or may not renew, and the renewal will be dependent on both parties agreeing to the renewal in writing, for a period to be determined at the time of renewal, unless either party provides the other with written notice of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days before the expiration of the Initial Term].",
                "explanation": "Original clause 6.1 states that 'this Agreement shall renew automatically for one (1) additional three (3) year period'. The changed text modifies this to state that the agreement 'may or may not renew' and is 'dependent on both parties agreeing to the renewal in writing'. This introduces a contradiction by making the renewal process conditional on agreement and a period that is determined later, rather than automatic. This creates uncertainty as to whether the contract will renew and on what terms.",

The modified clause states 'The License Fees may be refundable at the sole discretion of the Licensor, depending on the circumstances of the agreement.' This is a direct contradiction, changing the absolute non-refundability to a conditional refundability decided solely by one party, creating uncertainty about the Licensee's right to a refund.",

                "explanation": "Section 11.7 originally says 'Licensee shall not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer any of its obligations or performance, under this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without Licensor's prior written consent.' By adding 'unless an unexpected acquisition occurs, then they may assign or transfer with a notice of 10 days,' assignment is sometimes allowed. This adds uncertainty since the contract is contradictory.",

Exclusivity.\n\nThe license hereby granted shall be exclusive as to the products described in subparagraphs 2.(a)(1) and (2) of this Agreement, but nonexclusive as to all other products covered by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent KI, Inc. from granting any other licenses for the use of KI's name or likeness, or from utilizing KI's name and likeness in any manner whatsoever, except that KI, Inc. agrees that except as provided herein it will grant no other licenses for the territory to which this license extends for the use of KI's name and likeness in connection with the sale of the products described in subparagraphs 2.(a)(1) and (2) of this Agreement effective during the term of this Agreement.",

Exclusivity.\n\nThe license hereby granted shall be exclusive as to the products described in subparagraphs 2.(a)(1) and (2) of this Agreement, but nonexclusive as to all other products covered by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent KI, Inc. from granting any other licenses for the use of KI's name or likeness, or from utilizing KI's name and likeness in any manner whatsoever. KI, Inc. retains the right to grant other licenses, even for products described in subparagraphs 2.(a)(1) and (2), at its sole discretion, notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants exclusivity for specific products, but also contains a carve-out that seems to limit further licenses, but only 'except as provided herein'. The modified version removes the limitation and adds a provision that KI, Inc. can grant other licenses even for the exclusive products at its discretion. This directly contradicts the initial grant of exclusivity and creates uncertainty about the scope of Diplomat's exclusive rights.",

Disposal of Stock Upon Termination or Expiration.\n\nUpon and after the termination of the license, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Diplomat may dispose of products covered by this Agreement which are on hand, or in process at the time notice of termination is received, for a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days after notice of termination, provided advances and royalties with respect to that period are paid and statements are furnished for that period in accordance with paragraph 3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Diplomat shall not manufacture, sell or dispose of any products covered by this license after (a) the expiration of the license, or (b) the termination of the license based on (i) the failure of Diplomat to affix notice of copyright, trademark or service mark registration or any other notice to the products, cartons, containers, or packing or wrapping material or advertising, promotional or display material, or (ii) because of the departure by Diplomat from the quality and style approved by KI, Inc. pursuant to paragraph 9.",
                "changed_text": "16. Disposal of Stock Upon Termination or Expiration.\n\nUpon and after the termination of the license, Diplomat may, at its sole discretion, dispose of products covered by this Agreement which are on hand, or in process at the time notice of termination is received. This right extends indefinitely, regardless of any prior agreement, provided Diplomat informs KI, Inc. of any sales and pays a royalty of 1% on the net wholesale volume. This overrides any other termination clauses in this agreement regarding disposal of stock.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows Diplomat 120 days to dispose of stock after termination, with specific exceptions. The modified version removes the 120-day limit and the exceptions, granting Diplomat an indefinite right to dispose of stock after termination, subject only to informing KI, Inc. and paying a nominal royalty. This directly contradicts the original limitations and creates uncertainty about KI, Inc.'s rights to control the disposition of stock after termination.",

All duties and responsibilities in that case are transferable to that subsidiary.\n\nKI, Inc. may assign its rights hereunder, but shall furnish written notice of such assignment to Diplomat.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly prohibits assignment or sublicensing by Diplomat without KI, Inc.'s consent. The modified version adds an exception allowing Diplomat to assign the agreement to a subsidiary without consent.

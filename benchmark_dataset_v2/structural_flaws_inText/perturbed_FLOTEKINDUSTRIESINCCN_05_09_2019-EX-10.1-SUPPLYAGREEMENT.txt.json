                "changed_text": "\"Minimum Quantity\" means [***] pounds of Terpene Product per Year, prorated for any partial Year included in the Term. However, the actual minimum quantity may be adjusted at FCC's sole discretion based on market conditions.\n\n\"Product Price\" means with respect to a pound of Terpene Product the Terpene Cost of that Terpene Product, plus the Margin, unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Minimum Quantity' is a fixed amount. The change introduces ambiguity by allowing FCC to adjust it based on market conditions, contradicting the fixed definition and creating uncertainty. Similarly, the Product Price is initially explicitly defined, but the edited text allows for price changes based on mutual agreement, this contradicts the fixed definition and introduces uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states a clear payment term of 60 days. The modified clause adds that FCC can require payment in 30 days, creating a contradiction. This makes the payment deadline uncertain as it's unclear which timeframe applies under which circumstances.",

                "explanation": "The original warranty is absolute. The additions weaken the warranty. By adding 'to the best of FCC's knowledge' to the compliance with laws and regulations, it creates an out if FCC was unaware of non-compliance. By limiting liability for defects to replacement only, it undermines the 'free from any defect' claim.",

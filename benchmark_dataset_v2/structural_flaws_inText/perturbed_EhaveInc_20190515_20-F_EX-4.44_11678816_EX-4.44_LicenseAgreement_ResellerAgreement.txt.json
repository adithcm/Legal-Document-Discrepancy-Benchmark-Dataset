                "original_text": "TERM This term of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue in perpetuity (the \"Term\"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained herein.",
                "changed_text": "TERM This term of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial period of one (1) year (the \"Term\"), automatically renewable for successive one (1) year periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the term is in 'perpetuity,' creating a never-ending agreement, which is a very strong commitment. The changed version limits the term to an initial period of one year, then auto-renews for another one year, unless the party provides written notice. The 'perpetuity' clause now contradicts the idea of 'auto-renews,' making the agreement's time commitment and renewal terms unclear. ",

                "explanation": "The original text guarantees the solution will conform to specification and not have undocumented features, while the modified text delivers the documentation on an 'as is' basis, creating contradiction in guarantee. The original text says Ehave 'will' implement and perform, while the modified text says Ehave 'will attempt to' and 'will use commercially reasonable effort' creating a 'best effort' but not a guarantee. The original says Ehave says it 'is not aware of any infringement claims', while the modified says 'makes no warranty regarding infringement or misappropriation claims'. By changing the wording from firm commitments to 'best efforts' and disclaimers, it introduces uncertainty about the service's quality and legal security.",

Any indebtedness or obligation of Broker Dealer to Distributor or Issuer, whether arising hereunder or otherwise, shall be set off against any compensation payable under this Agreement or any other agreement between or among the Parties or their affiliates. Indebtedness or obligations include but are not limited to any debt, liability, or debit balance resulting from Issuer's reversal of compensation under this Agreement or any other agreement between or among the Parties or their affiliates. It also includes any amount paid by Issuer or Distributor, including reasonable attorney fees and costs, to settle a complaint or satisfy any judgment entered by any court, administrative agency or arbitrator related to any Annuity Contract sold by Broker Dealer, or its producers or breach of Broker Dealer's duties and responsibilities contained in this or any prior Agreement, whether or not the liability for settlement or satisfaction of judgment arose after the termination of this Agreement. Issuer or Distributor reserves the right to use any remedies under the law to collect any indebtedness Broker Dealer owes Issuer or Distributor and Broker Dealer agrees to pay any reasonable attorney's fees and actual costs of collection incurred as a result of such action.",

Any indebtedness or obligation of Broker Dealer to Distributor or Issuer, whether arising hereunder or otherwise, may be set off against any compensation payable under this Agreement or any other agreement between or among the Parties or their affiliates at the discretion of the Issuer.

                "explanation": "The original text states that indebtedness \"shall be set off\", creating a mandatory obligation. The modified text changes \"shall\" to \"may\", making the set-off discretionary and creating uncertainty as to whether the Issuer will actually apply the set-off.",

The revised text allows the distributor and issuer to ignore the conditions which would result in termination. This makes the termination clause discretionary and contradicts the 'automatically terminate' clause.",

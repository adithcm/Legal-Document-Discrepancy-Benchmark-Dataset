This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue in full force and effect until the end of the fifteenth (15th) Contract Year, and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter until terminated by either Party by providing thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice of termination to the other Party (such fifteen (15) Contract Year period, as may be further extended as provided herein is referred to as the \"Term\").",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a 30-day written notice for termination after the initial 15-year term. The modified version allows termination \"at any time, without prior written notice,\" directly contradicting the original provision. This creates uncertainty regarding the proper procedure for terminating the agreement after the initial term.",

The modified version states that assignment can occur freely without consent, but retains the phrase about consent being withheld, conditioned, or delayed for any reason, thus creating a contradiction, as free assignment does not require consent at all. This generates uncertainty about whether assignment is permissible with or without consent.",

                "explanation": "The original text stated that disclosures \"may be made\" under specified circumstances, which implied optionality. The modified text changes this to disclosures \"must be made\" under those same circumstances. This contradicts the general principle of confidentiality established in Section 19.14(a) which states information cannot be disclosed without written consent of the other party, but (b) is now saying that it must be disclosed in all the scenarios. This creates uncertainty whether the disclosure is required, and potentially conflicting obligations, for a party. It generates doubt about the extent of confidentiality provided for in the agreement.",

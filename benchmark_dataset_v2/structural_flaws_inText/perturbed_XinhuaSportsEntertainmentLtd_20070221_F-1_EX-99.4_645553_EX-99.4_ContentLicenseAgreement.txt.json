                "original_text": "TERM means the term as set out in Clause 7; and\n\nTERRITORY means the world excluding the People's Republic of China.",
                "changed_text": "TERM means a period of twenty (20) years from the Effective Date, unless terminated earlier according to Clause 8; and\n\nTERRITORY means the world, including the People's Republic of China.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'TERRITORY' explicitly excludes the People's Republic of China. By changing the definition to include it, we create a direct contradiction with subsequent clauses that differentiate rights and obligations based on whether they pertain to the People's Republic of China or the rest of the world. This creates confusion over which terms apply where. The term 'TERM' originally pointed to Clause 7. By changing it to a definition with specifics, it contradicts Clause 7 later in the document.",

TERM\n\n7.1  This Agreement shall take effect from the Effective Date and continue in      full force and effect for twenty (20) years thereafter, unless otherwise      terminated in accordance with Clause 8.\n\n7.2  This Agreement may be renewed for an additional term of ten (10) years by      notice in writing given by XFN to CEIS at the expiry of the Term, for a      consideration to be mutually agreed.",
                "changed_text": "7.   TERM\n\n7.1  This Agreement shall take effect from the Effective Date and continue in full force and effect unless terminated in accordance with Clause 8. The term length is at the discretion of CEIS.\n\n7.2  Renewal is not guaranteed and is subject to CEIS's approval, irrespective of prior agreements or notices. Any consideration for renewal will be determined solely by CEIS.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 20-year term with an option for a 10-year renewal under certain conditions. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the term length is at CEIS's discretion, contradicting the initial 20-year term. The renewal is now subject to CEIS's approval, regardless of prior agreements, directly conflicting with the original clause detailing the process for renewal based on written notice. This introduces uncertainty regarding the duration and renewal terms of the agreement, shifting power heavily towards CEIS and making the terms unpredictable for XFN.",

                "original_text": "4.   CONSIDERATION\n\n4.1  In consideration of the rights and obligations of the Parties, XFN shall      pay to CEIS US$1.1 million (United States Dollars One Million and One\n\nSource: XINHUA SPORTS & ENTERTAINMENT LTD, F-1, 2/21/2007\n\n\n     Hundred Thousand) for a term of twenty (20) years, in cash or such other      consideration as the Parties may agree. The payment schedule shall be by      five (5) instalments of US$220,000 each. The first instalment will be      effect on condition that XFN can raise at least US$1.1 million additional      funding in 2002.",
                "changed_text": "4.   CONSIDERATION\n\n4.1  In consideration of the rights and obligations of the Parties, XFN shall potentially pay CEIS a sum to be determined later, in a form to be decided by CEIS. The payment schedule will be determined at CEIS's sole discretion, and may be altered at any time. The obligation for payment is contingent upon CEIS's ongoing satisfaction with XFN's performance.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states the amount of consideration (US$1.1 million) and the payment schedule. The modified clause introduces significant ambiguity by stating that the sum and form of payment will be determined later, effectively removing any concrete obligation for XFN. The alteration of the payment schedule at CEIS's discretion and the contingency based on CEIS's 'ongoing satisfaction' contradict the original, defined terms, creating uncertainty and shifting control entirely to CEIS. This makes the financial obligations vague and unenforceable, creating a significant imbalance in the contract.",

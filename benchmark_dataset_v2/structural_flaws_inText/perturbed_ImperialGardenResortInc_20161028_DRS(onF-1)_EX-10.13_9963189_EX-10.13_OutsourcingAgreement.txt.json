                "original_text": "Article IV. Service Fee\n\nThe fees for services mentioned in Part I to Part VI are NTD 12 million ((SAY TWELVE MILLION ONLY) in total and the fees for planning and design of the buildings and construction monitoring shall be calculated based on the ratio of 3.50% of the legal construction cost hereof. Should Party A require a comprehensive modification on the development plan of the project outsourced and any subsequent extra cost occur in Party B; Party A shall bear the corresponding extra service fee.",
                "changed_text": "Article IV. Service Fee\n\nThe fees for services mentioned in Part I to Part VI are subject to change based on market conditions and shall be determined at the sole discretion of Party A. The fees for planning and design of the buildings and construction monitoring shall be determined through negotiation between both parties, but Party A has the final say. Should Party A require a comprehensive modification on the development plan of the project outsourced and any subsequent extra cost occur in Party B; the responsibility for covering that extra service fee is up to Party A's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction because Article IV originally specified a fixed service fee of NTD 12 million for specific services. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that these fees are subject to change based on market conditions and at Party A's discretion. This contradicts the initial agreement of a fixed fee, creating potential disputes over payment amounts. Furthermore, 'the responsibility for covering that extra service fee is up to Party A's discretion' makes it ambiguous whether Party A is obligated to pay at all.",

Establishment of architectural development plan and business plan (about 2.0 months); III. Development of soil and water conservation plan (about 2.0 months); IV. Establishment of environmental impact assessment report (about 8.0 months); V.

                "explanation": "The original Article VII provides estimated timelines for various project stages. The modification creates a contradiction by stating that these timelines are 'only an estimation' and are 'subject to change at Party A's discretion' and 'Party A will decide on the ultimate timelines'. This undermines the initial 'term planned' and gives Party A unilateral control over the schedule, contradicting the expectation of a mutually agreed-upon timeline and making the durations open to interpretation.",

The modified version introduces contradictions by weakening these obligations. 'Party B shall follow *some* instructions...' implies that Party B can disregard certain instructions at its discretion. 'Party B is *recommended* to report' suggests that progress reporting is not mandatory, contradicting the original obligatory statement. This undermines Party B's responsibilities and introduces uncertainty about their commitment to the project's success.",

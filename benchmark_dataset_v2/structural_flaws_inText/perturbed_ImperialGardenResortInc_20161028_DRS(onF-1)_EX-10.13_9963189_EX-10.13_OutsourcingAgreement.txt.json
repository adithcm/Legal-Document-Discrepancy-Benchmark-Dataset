The fees for planning and design of the buildings and construction monitoring shall be determined at Party A's discretion, not necessarily based on the ratio of 3.50% of the legal construction cost hereof.

                "explanation": "The original text stated a fixed service fee of NTD 12 million for parts I-VI. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating it 'may be' NTD 12 million and is 'subject to Party A's approval.' The original also fixed the planning fee based on 3.50% of legal cost, but the change makes it 'at Party A's discretion.' Finally, the responsibility for extra fees is no longer clearly assigned to Party A.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulated a mandatory payment schedule, but the rewrite introduces ambiguity with phrases like 'unless otherwise agreed,' 'may be paid,' 'will potentially be paid,' 'is suggested to be paid,' 'could be paid', 'is optional to be paid', 'should be paid, given Party A agrees', 'is negotiable', 'might be paid', 'may be paid', and 'is uncertain to be paid'. This creates conflicting interpretations regarding Party A's payment obligations. Also, the refund clause has been altered to a case-by-case basis, rather than specifically saying 'the architect herein, the architect shall refund the fees paid in full without taking any interest to the client'.",

Any notice of termination, whether written or verbal, will be considered valid. At the end of the Initial Term, Parties can negotiate in good faith regarding a possible extension of the Initial Term, but such negotiation will not affect the immediate termination rights granted in this section.\n\nParties can mutually agree in writing to deviate from the immediate termination rights by expressly waiving them in a separate addendum to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies an initial term and a process for termination with a notification period, implying a degree of commitment. The modified text introduces the possibility of immediate termination by either party, contradicting the initial term and creating uncertainty about the contract's duration and the parties' obligations to each other. The original section describes a renewal process unless a proper notification is given, while the new section allows termination at any time without any notification.",

Neither Party shall make any public announcements, including but not limited to press releases, articles, brochures, advertisements and speeches, concerning this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. However, ELEPHANT TALK is entitled to communicate - as far as strictly necessary for the proper conclusion of its agreements- to the ELEPHANT TALK Customer that its services are provided by (the) T-Mobile (network). ELEPHANT TALK Customers shall be entitled to communicate that the network coverage is provided by T-Mobile, only in case they are asked for it. Under no circumstances, ELEPHANT TALK Customers shall make any public announcements, including but not limited to press releases, commercial articles (not being technical or business articles), brochures, advertisements, public speeches and other promotional material, that its services to mobile end-users are provided by the T-Mobile network. Parties are aware of the fact that it might be impossible for technical reasons to make a reference to the ELEPHANT TALK (Customer) brand name on the display of devices and that the T-Mobile brand name may appear. ELEPHANT TALK shall do the utmost to ensure that the communication to mobile telecommunication end-users- including the communication of ELEPHANT TALK Customers - shall be in accordance with this article.\n\n11.2 The Parties hereby agree to treat all information exchanged between them (hereinafter referred to as \"Confidential Information\") whether for the purposes of this Agreement or not as confidential and agree not to disclose such Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever in whole or in part except as provided for in the article 11.4. The Parties may disclose Confidential Information only to employees, attorneys at law and accountants or other professional advisers who need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of participation in the discussions connected with this Agreement between the Parties and any transaction resulting there from and who are informed of and bound to the confidential nature of such Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "11.1 The Parties agree that all aspects of the content of this Agreement shall be treated as confidential. However, both parties reserve the right to disclose any information about the agreement to any third party, including competitors, without prior consent. Public announcements are permitted at any time.\n\n11.2 The Parties hereby agree that any information exchanged between them (hereinafter referred to as \"Confidential Information\") will be considered open and accessible. Both parties are explicitly encouraged to share this information widely, including but not limited to, distribution through social media, public forums, and direct communication with media outlets. The Parties may disclose Confidential Information only to employees, attorneys at law and accountants or other professional advisers who need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of participation in the discussions connected with this Agreement between the Parties and any transaction resulting there from and who are informed of and bound to the confidential nature of such Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes strict confidentiality regarding the Agreement's contents. The modified text introduces a direct contradiction by stating that both parties reserve the right to disclose information to any third party, even competitors, without consent, and also encourage to share widely. The confidentiality previously agreed upon is completely negated, creating uncertainty about which provisions are actually enforceable. Also, at the end of section 11.2., there is a contradiction, first saying it will be openly accesible, then telling they can only share with some experts bound to confidentiality.",

The responsible party is liable for any and all damages caused.\n\n12.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in certain situations, the Parties agree that there is no liability for any loss or damage suffered by either party arising out of, or in connection with, the Agreement. It will be decided on a case-by-case basis. The decision of whether to hold the counterpart liable will be at the sole discretion of the management of the company, without the possibility of any legal appeals.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides specific limitations of liability, setting maximum amounts for certain types of damages. The modified text initially states that liability is unlimited, directly contradicting the specific limitations outlined in the original. Then, it says that the Parties agree that there is no liability for any loss or damage suffered by either party arising out of, or in connection with, the Agreement, and that it is at sole discretion of the management of the company to hold the counterpart liable without any legal appeals. It creates a situation where it's unclear what damages, if any, can be claimed, and introduces uncertainty about the allocation of risk.",

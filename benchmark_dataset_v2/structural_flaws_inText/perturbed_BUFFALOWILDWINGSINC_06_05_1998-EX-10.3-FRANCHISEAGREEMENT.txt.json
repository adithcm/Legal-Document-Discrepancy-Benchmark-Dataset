If the lease for the site of the Franchised Restaurant expires or terminates for reasons other than your breach, or if the site is destroyed, condemned or otherwise rendered unusable, or as otherwise may be agreed upon in writing by us and you, we will grant permission for relocation of the Franchised Restaurant within your Designated Area at a location and site acceptable to us.  Any such relocation shall be at your sole expense and we shall have the right to charge you for any and all reasonable costs incurred by us, and a reasonable fee for our services, in connection with any such relocation of the Franchised Restaurant.",
                "changed_text": "A.   You shall operate the Franchised Restaurant only at the location specified in Paragraph I of this Agreement.  Even if the lease for the site of the Franchised Restaurant expires or terminates for reasons other than your breach, or if the site is destroyed, condemned or otherwise rendered unusable, we are under no obligation to permit relocation of the Franchised Restaurant, and any decision to allow relocation is at our sole discretion.  Any such relocation, if permitted, shall be at your sole expense and we shall have the right to charge you for any and all costs we deem appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text suggests relocation is granted if certain conditions are met. The modified text contradicts this by stating that the franchisor is under no obligation to allow relocation, introducing uncertainty about the franchisee's rights if the original location becomes unusable.",

Before using any promotional and advertising materials, you will submit to us or our designated agency, for our prior approval, all information pertaining to promotional materials and advertising initiated by you, including, but not limited to, newspapers, radio and television advertising, Internet or any other medium, specialty and novelty items, signs, boxes, napkins, bags and wrapping papers.  In the event written disapproval of any such advertising and promotional material has not been given by us to you within twenty (20) days from the date such information has been received by us, the materials will be deemed approved.",

Even if written disapproval of any such advertising and promotional material has not been given by us to you within twenty (20) days from the date such information has been received by us, the materials will not be deemed approved until our express written consent has been provided. Failure to obtain express written approval constitutes a breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies that if no disapproval is given within 20 days, the advertising is approved. The modified text directly contradicts this, stating that express written approval is always required, thus making the franchisor's approval process unclear.",

If you are in substantial compliance with this Agreement and we materially breach this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after written notice thereof is delivered to us, you may terminate this Agreement.  \"Reasonable time,\" as used herein, shall be construed as allowing us at least thirty (30) days within which to commence curing any such material breach.  Such termination shall be effective thirty (30) days after delivery to us of written notice that such breach has not been cured and you elect to terminate this Agreement.  An attempted termination of this Agreement by you except as provided in this Paragraph shall be deemed a termination without cause and a breach of this Agreement.",

If you are in substantial compliance with this Agreement and we materially breach this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after written notice thereof is delivered to us, you may attempt to terminate this Agreement. However, our decision to allow any termination is at our sole discretion and not guaranteed. 'Reasonable time,' as used herein, may or may not be granted based on our internal review of the situation. Furthermore, we reserve the right to deny any termination request. An attempted termination of this Agreement by you except as potentially approved by us shall be deemed a termination without cause and a breach of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the franchisee's right to terminate the agreement upon the franchisor's breach, making it subject to the franchisor's discretion. This severely undermines the franchisee's protection against the franchisor's non-compliance with the agreement.",

You receive a Designated Area within which we and our affiliates shall not operate or grant to anyone else a franchise to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings or bw-3 Restaurant so long as this Agreement is in force and effect.  The Designated Area is described in writing and on a map attached to the Agreement as EXHIBIT B and is made a part of the Agreement.

You receive a Designated Area within which we and our affiliates shall not operate or grant to anyone else a franchise to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings or bw-3 Restaurant so long as this Agreement is in force and effect.  The Designated Area is described in writing and on a map attached to the Agreement as EXHIBIT B and is made a part of the Agreement.  You may have the right to sublicense or subfranchise others within the Designated Area depending on negotiations between you and the Franchisor, which will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

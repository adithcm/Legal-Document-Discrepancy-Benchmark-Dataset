An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it controls, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.",

An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it controls, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Affiliate(s)\" is modified to say that an entity controls another when it owns just 25% (instead of 51%) or more of the share capital. This creates a contradiction because it makes the definition of what constitutes an affiliate ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "Clause 14.2 now directly contradicts 14.1 by allowing IMPCO to enter into other similar agreements as long as MINDA/MIL is informed. This creates uncertainty about the exclusivity of the joint venture.",

                "explanation": "The original Clause 16.2 mandates immediate resignation of directors and nominees of a party ceasing to be a shareholder. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that the remaining parties will decide whether the resignation shall occur. This is contradictory to the word 'automatically' making the resignation no longer an automatic action, creating potential ambiguity.",

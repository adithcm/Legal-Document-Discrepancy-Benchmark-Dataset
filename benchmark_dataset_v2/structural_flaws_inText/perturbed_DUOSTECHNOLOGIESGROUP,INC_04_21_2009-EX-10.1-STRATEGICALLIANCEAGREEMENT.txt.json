DEFINITIONS.\n     1.1 Confidential Information shall mean all non-public information of a Party, which is disclosed to the other Party hereunder, including,  without limitation, trade secrets, technical information, business information, sales information, marketing information, customer-buying patterns,  algorithms, customer and potential customer lists and identities, product sales plans, sublicense agreements, inventions, developments,  discoveries, software, know-how, methods, techniques, formulae, data, processes and other trade secrets and proprietary ideas, whether or not protectable under patent, trademark, copyright or other areas of law, and any other information marked as \"proprietary\"  or \"confidential\" at the  time of disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, \"Confidential Information\" shall not include any information that (a) was or has become  publicly available without restriction through no fault of the receiving Party or its employees or agents; (b) is received without restriction from a  third party that, to the best knowledge of the receiving Party, did not have an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; (c) was  rightfully in possession of the receiving Party without restriction prior to its disclosure by the other Party; or (d) was independently developed by  employees of the receiving Party that had no knowledge of or access to such information, as evidenced by written records of the receiving Party.",
                "changed_text": "1. DEFINITIONS.\n     1.1 Confidential Information shall generally mean non-public information. Confidential Information may include what is described in Section 8.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, \"Confidential Information\" shall not include any information that (a) was or has become  publicly available without restriction through no fault of the receiving Party or its employees or agents; (b) is received without restriction from a  third party that, to the best knowledge of the receiving Party, did not have an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; (c) was  rightfully in possession of the receiving Party without restriction prior to its disclosure by the other Party; or (d) was independently developed by  employees of the receiving Party that had no knowledge of or access to such information, as evidenced by written records of the receiving Party.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Confidential Information is very broad and detailed. The modified definition makes the term 'Confidential Information' ambiguous by only stating a generally non-public information, creating contradiction. The original made the scope explicit, while now it is very ambiguous.",

The Day Rate for each type of service  provided will be as per the rate card set out in Exhibit C, such rates to be subject to annual review by the Parties on the anniversary of this  Agreement provided that such rates may be reviewed on an ad hoc basis at any time should the Parties become aware of specific information  which impacts on the validity or feasibility of the Day Rate.",

The Day Rate for each type of service provided will be determined at the time of service, and will be communicated but there is no guarantee it will be equal to what's in Exhibit C. The Day Rate may be reviewed on an ad hoc basis at any time should the Parties become aware of specific information which impacts on the validity or feasibility of the Day Rate.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies the Day Rate is as per Exhibit C, subject to annual review. The modified version removes the direct link to Exhibit C and states the rate will be determined at the time of service, and rates provided in Exhibit C are not guaranteed to be followed. This contradicts the original established method for determining day rates. Exhibit C now carries less value than it did originally.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specified automatic renewal, where the modified version changes it to where the terms of the contract have to be mutually agreed upon. This is more stringent than the original text, and creates ambiguity. This creates an inconsistency on how renewals will be handled.",

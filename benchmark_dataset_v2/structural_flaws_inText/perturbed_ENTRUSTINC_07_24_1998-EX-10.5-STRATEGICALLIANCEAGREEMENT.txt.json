                "explanation": "The original clause granted Nortel an *irrevocable* license. Changing it to *revocable* and adding a condition for revocation creates a contradiction. It becomes uncertain whether Nortel truly has a guaranteed right to use Entrust's patents.",

However, this agreement may be extended indefinitely at NTL's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause sets a clear termination date. Adding a provision for indefinite extension at NTL's discretion introduces contradiction.

The Company and the Remarketing Agents will enter into a Pricing Agreement, to be dated the Remarketing Date (as defined below) (the \"Pricing Agreement\"), which will set forth, inter alia, the final terms of the Remarketed Securities (as defined below) and the Remarketing Fee (as defined below). The Remarketing Agents are undertaking to remarket Series E Senior Component Debentures, Tranche 1, due 2018 (principal amount $1,000 per Series E Senior Component Debenture) (the \"First Tranche Series E Debt Securities\") and Series E Senior Component Debentures, Tranche 2, due 2045 (principal amount $1,000 per Series E Senior Component Debenture) (the \"Second Tranche Series E Debt Securities\"), whose terms will each be modified in the event of a Successful Remarketing (as defined below), as provided in the notice of remarketing from the Company, dated August 26, 2014 (the \"Notice\") pursuant to Section 3.3(a) of the Twenty-Second Supplemental Indenture (as defined below) and Section 5.2(a)(iv) of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement (as defined below) (such securities, as so modified from and after a Successful Remarketing (whether or not such securities were remarketed by the Remarketing Agents), the \"Securities\").

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that upon a Successful Remarketing, the Stated Maturity of the First and Second Tranche Series E Debt Securities WILL automatically be adjusted to December 15, 2017 and December 15, 2044, respectively. The modified version replaces the word 'will' with 'may' and introduces subjective criteria such as 'subject to market conditions and the Company's discretion', creating uncertainty about the adjustment.",

                "explanation": "Section 1 outlines the 'Obligations of the Remarketing Agents.' By changing 'agree' to 'may agree' and inserting subjective wording like 'if they see fit' and 'some of the other duties', the modified text now suggests that the Remarketing Agents' commitment to using commercially reasonable efforts, establishing Reset Rates, and carrying out other duties is discretionary. This directly contradicts the initial statement of 'Obligations,' creating confusion and potential disputes regarding the extent of their required actions.",

                "explanation": "By changing the initial firm assertion to 'must try to have' and 'makes no promises,' the modified text significantly weakens the Company's representation about holding necessary approvals and being in compliance. The explicit disclaimer creates a contradiction, suggesting the company might not actually possess all required approvals or comply with all regulations. This introduces risk and uncertainty, as it implies that critical operational aspects might be unapproved or non-compliant.",

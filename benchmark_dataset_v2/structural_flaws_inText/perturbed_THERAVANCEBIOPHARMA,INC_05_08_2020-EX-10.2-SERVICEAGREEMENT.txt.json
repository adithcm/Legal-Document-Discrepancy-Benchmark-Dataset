                "original_text": "4. Duties 4.1 The Executive shall serve as Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, Development (reporting to Rick Winningham) or in such other role as the Company may determine. 4.2 During the employment the Executive shall: 4.2.1 devote the whole of their working time, attention and abilities to the business of the Company and any other Group Company for which the Executive is required to work from time to time; 4.2.2 promptly make such reports to the Company in connection with the Executive's duties or other such matters at such times as are reasonably required; 4.2.3 faithfully and diligently exercise such powers and perform such duties for each Group Company as may from time to time be assigned by the Company; 4.2.4 comply with all reasonable and lawful directions given by the Company; 4.2.5 report their own wrongdoing and any wrongdoing or proposed or potential wrongdoing of any other employee, officer or consultant of any Group Company to the Company immediately on becoming aware of it; 4.2.6 use their utmost endeavours to promote, protect, develop and extend the business of the Company; 4.2.7 comply with their common law, statutory, regulatory and fiduciary duties as well as any policies put in place by the Company from time to time; 4.2.8 exercise the Executive's powers jointly with such other person that the Company may appoint; and 4.2.9 at all times conduct the business of each Group Company for which the Executive is responsible in a lawful and ethical manner.",
                "changed_text": "4. Duties 4.1 The Executive shall serve as Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, Development (reporting to Rick Winningham) or in such other role as the Company may determine at its sole discretion. 4.2 During the employment the Executive is encouraged but not required to: 4.2.1 devote a portion of their working time, attention, and abilities to the business of the Company, as the Executive deems fit. 4.2.2 submit reports to the Company related to the Executive's duties or other matters only when the Executive believes it is necessary. 4.2.3 exercise such powers and perform duties for each Group Company as the Executive sees appropriate. 4.2.4 comply with directions given by the Company, only when the Executive agrees with said directions. 4.2.5 report their own wrongdoing and wrongdoing of others at the Executive's own discretion. 4.2.6 promote the business of the Company only when it aligns with the Executive's personal goals. 4.2.7 comply with their common law, statutory, regulatory, and fiduciary duties as the Executive understands them. 4.2.8 exercise the Executive's powers independently unless explicitly requested otherwise. 4.2.9 conduct the business of each Group Company in a manner that the Executive deems ethical.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by weakening the initial duties. The original text specifies that the Executive 'shall' perform certain duties. The modified version uses phrases like 'is encouraged but not required', 'as the Executive deems fit', and 'only when the Executive agrees' which undermines the mandatory nature of the Executive's responsibilities, causing uncertainty about what's required.",

Confidential Information 15.1 Without prejudice to the Executive's common law and fiduciary duties, the Executive shall not during employment or at any time after Termination and whether for their own benefit or for the benefit of any third party: 15.1.1 use any Confidential Information; or 15.1.2 disclose any Confidential Information to any person, company or other organisation whatsoever, except in the proper course of their duties, as required by law or as authorised by the Company in writing. 15.2 The Executive shall be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and shall use best endeavours to prevent the misuse of Confidential Information by others. 15.3 All Confidential Information and Copies shall be the property of the Company and the Executive shall not make any Copies save in the proper course of their employment. 15.4 Save as authorised by the Company, the Executive shall not make or publish any comment regarding to the business or affairs of any Group Company or any Group Companies' current or former employees or directors to the media (including on social media).",
                "changed_text": "15. Confidential Information 15.1 The Executive is not required to keep any information confidential. The company understands the executive needs to share information freely. \n15.2 The Executive shall not be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. If something happens to the information, it is not the executive's responsibility.\n15.3 Confidential information does not belong to the company. It is the executive's to use as they see fit.\n15.4 The Executive can make any comment regarding the business as they wish.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation completely contradicts the original confidentiality clause. The original clause strictly prohibits the use and disclosure of Confidential Information both during and after employment. The modified version removes any restrictions on the use and disclosure of confidential information and even gives permission to comment on any Group Company to the media. This introduces extreme uncertainty as it directly opposes the legally standard confidentiality provisions.",

Post Termination Restrictions During the term of employment and for one (1) year thereafter, the Executive will not directly or indirectly, either themselves or through others, encourage or solicit any employee of the Company to leave the Company for any reason. This obligation shall not affect any responsibility the Executive has as an employee of the Company with respect to the bona fide hiring and firing of Company personnel.",
                "changed_text": "21. Post Termination Restrictions The Executive is encouraged to actively recruit employees of the Company for other opportunities after termination. The company believes in employee growth.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original post-termination restriction. The original text prevents the executive from soliciting employees for one year after termination. The modified text encourages the executive to actively recruit employees for other opportunities. This undermines the non-solicitation agreement, making it completely unenforceable. The phrase 'The company believes in employee growth' further emphasizes the contradiction.",

Subject to the terms set forth in this agreement, Erchonia grants Distributor the exclusive, non- transferable right and license to promote, distribute and sell the Products identified in Exhibit A to those type of customer specified in Exhibit B and only within the Territory specified in Exhibit B. Distributor shall only distribute or sell the Products to customers who are licensed health care professionals and meet the other requirements set forth in Exhibit B.",

Subject to the terms set forth in this agreement, Erchonia grants Distributor the exclusive, non- transferable right and license to promote, distribute and sell the Products identified in Exhibit A to those type of customer specified in Exhibit B and only within the Territory specified in Exhibit B. Distributor may distribute or sell the Products to any customer, regardless of whether they are licensed health care professionals or meet the other requirements set forth in Exhibit B.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly limits the Distributor to selling to licensed health care professionals meeting Exhibit B requirements. The modification removes this restriction, creating a contradiction and uncertainty about who the Distributor can sell to.",

Failure to meet these minimum performance goals for any period, shall, at Erchonia's option (i) be considered a breach of this agreement for which Erchonia shall have all the rights and remedies provided for herein upon a breach of this agreement, including termination of this agreement, or (ii) shall give Erchonia to terminate or limit the exclusivity provisions of this agreement",

Failure to meet these minimum performance goals for any period, shall not be considered a breach of this agreement, nor shall give Erchonia to terminate or limit the exclusivity provisions of this agreement. Erchonia may offer guidance on how to meet these goals.",
                "explanation": "The original text makes meeting minimum performance goals a requirement, with failure leading to breach or termination of exclusivity. The modified text turns this into an aspirational goal, removing any consequences for failure and thus contradicting the original severity.",

                "original_text": "REVENUE SHARE/FEE: Commencing on March 1, 2020 and thereafter, the Parties shall share revenue generated from Customer's consumer offerings, including but not limited to its content, technology, traffic, data, websites, apps, videos and podcasts, without offset and regardless of which Party is responsible for securing such revenue, as per the attached Schedule 1.",
                "changed_text": "REVENUE SHARE/FEE: Commencing on March 1, 2020 and thereafter, the Parties *may* share revenue generated from Customer's consumer offerings, including but not limited to its content, technology, traffic, data, websites, apps, videos and podcasts, with offsets determined by Kubient and regardless of which Party is responsible for securing such revenue, as per the attached Schedule 1.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the parties 'shall' share revenue, implying a mandatory obligation. The modified text uses 'may,' which introduces discretion and contradicts the initial mandatory sharing agreement. Further, the clause 'without offset' is replaced with 'with offsets determined by Kubient'. This introduces ambiguity and gives Kubient unilateral power to reduce Customer's revenue share, directly conflicting with the original statement of sharing 'without offset'.",

Subject to the doctrine of sequential liability, payment shall be made to the appropriate Party net 30 days from the end of the calendar month.",

Payment shall be made to the appropriate Party at Kubient's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear deadline (10 days) for reconciliation and a specific payment term (net 30 days). The modified text replaces the reconciliation deadline with 'within a reasonable timeframe', which is vague and subjective. It also states that payment shall be made 'at Kubient's discretion' which contradicts the original 'net 30 days'. This creates uncertainty about when payments will be made, shifting control to Kubient and creating a contradiction.",

During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer agrees not to work with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer comes to know through disclosure by Kubient as part of the Services, without the express written consent of Kubient and compensation to Kubient under the applicable exhibit and/or schedule. Provided however, this provision shall not apply in the event Customer can establish, in writing, that it had a preexisting working relationship with such Third-Party prior to the Agreement and without Kubient's assistance. Customer acknowledges that this provision is reasonable and necessary for the protection of Kubient and that Kubient will be irrevocably damaged if such covenant is not specifically enforced. Customer further agrees that Kubient will be entitled to seek injunctive relief for the purpose of restraining Customer from violating this covenant (and no bond or other security shall be required in connection therewith) in addition to any other relief to which Kubient may be entitled under the Agreement.",

During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, Customer *may* work with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer comes to know through disclosure by Kubient as part of the Services, with notification to Kubient. The original clause that states that 'Customer agrees not to work with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer comes to know through disclosure by Kubient as part of the Services, without the express written consent of Kubient and compensation to Kubient under the applicable exhibit and/or schedule' is now rendered optional. This directly contradicts the initial restrictions placed on Customer's ability to work with these third parties, creating uncertainty about whether the non-circumvent clause is actually enforceable.",

The modified version grants the customer the opportunity to work with the third parties 'with notification to Kubient'. This directly contradicts the original clause, creating uncertainty.",

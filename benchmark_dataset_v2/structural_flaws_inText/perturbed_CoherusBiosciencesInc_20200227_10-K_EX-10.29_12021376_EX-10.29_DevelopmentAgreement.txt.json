                "original_text": "15.1 Term. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Parties' respective rights and obligations under this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in full force for ten (10) years after the First Commercial Sale of the first Licensed Product, and shall thereafter automatically renew for an unlimited period of time unless otherwise terminated in accordance with Section 15.2.",
                "changed_text": "15.1 Term. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Parties' respective rights and obligations under this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in full force for ten (10) years after the First Commercial Sale of the first Licensed Product, and shall thereafter be subject to renegotiation on an annual basis, with renewal contingent upon mutual agreement by both parties. If mutual agreement on renewal terms cannot be reached, the agreement shall terminate at the end of the then-current year.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic renewal for an unlimited period. The revised text introduces a conflicting condition, making renewal subject to annual renegotiation and mutual agreement. This creates uncertainty about the agreement's duration.",

All of the Receiving Party's obligations under Sections 11.1 and 11.2 hereof, with respect to the protection of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information shall for a period of [***] ([***]) [***] survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.",

All of the Receiving Party's obligations under Sections 11.1 and 11.2 hereof, with respect to the protection of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information shall for a period of [***] ([***]) [***] survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever. However, in the event of termination due to Licensee's breach, the Receiving Party's obligations under Sections 11.1 and 11.2 shall immediately cease upon termination.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction regarding the survival of confidentiality obligations. The original clause states they survive for a specific period regardless of the reason for termination. The added sentence states that in case of Licensee's breach, confidentiality obligations cease immediately, creating ambiguity.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Bioeq shall be primarily responsible for the Development of Licensed Products; however, Licensee may, at its discretion, contribute to the Development efforts and associated costs, and Bioeq must consider and accept the assistance from Licensee. In the event that the Licensee does not wish to contribute or assist, Bioeq shall be solely responsible for the Development of Licensed Products and shall bear all costs and expenses relating thereto.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states Bioeq is solely responsible for development. The modified text introduces the possibility of Licensee contributing to development efforts and costs, which contradicts the 'solely responsible' aspect of Bioeq's obligation. This creates uncertainty about each party's exact development responsibilities and could cause disputes over costs.",

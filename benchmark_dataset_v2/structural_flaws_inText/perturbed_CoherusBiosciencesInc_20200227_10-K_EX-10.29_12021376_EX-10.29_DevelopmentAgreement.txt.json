Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Parties' respective rights and obligations under this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in full force for ten (10) years after the First Commercial Sale of the first Licensed Product, and shall thereafter automatically renew for an unlimited period of time unless otherwise terminated in accordance with Section 15.2.",
                "changed_text": "15.1 Term. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Parties' respective rights and obligations under this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in full force for ten (10) years after the First Commercial Sale of the first Licensed Product, and shall thereafter renew for subsequent one (1) year terms contingent on the approval of both parties, unless otherwise terminated in accordance with Section 15.2.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the contract auto-renews for an unlimited period unless terminated. The modified text requires mutual approval for each subsequent renewal, contradicting the idea of automatic, unlimited renewal. This creates uncertainty about the contract's long-term duration and each party's obligations.",

Licensee shall promptly inform Bioeq in writing of any Licensee Improvements promptly after such Licensee Improvements are developed or reduced to practice. Licensee hereby grants to Bioeq during the term of this Agreement (and, subject to Section 15.3.4, after termination or expiration of this Agreement) a non-exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable license (including the right to grant sublicenses) under all Intellectual Property Rights and Know-How Controlled by Licensee and embodied within, or claiming or covering the Licensee Improvements, to Develop, Manufacture, sell, import, or otherwise Commercialize Licensed Products outside of the Territory.",

Licensee shall promptly inform Bioeq in writing of any Licensee Improvements promptly after such Licensee Improvements are developed or reduced to practice.

                "explanation": "The original text grants Bioeq an irrevocable license to use Licensee Improvements. The modified text makes this license revocable.

The modified text states that these obligations cease immediately upon termination, creating a direct contradiction.

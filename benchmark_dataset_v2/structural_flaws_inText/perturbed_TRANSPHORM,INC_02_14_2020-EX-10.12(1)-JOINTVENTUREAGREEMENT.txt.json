The modified version removes 'or (iii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII hereof' from the Joint Venture definition and adds a contradictory statement specifying that Termination has no impact on the definition. This contradicts the duration and scope of the Joint Venture, potentially leading to disputes over obligations post-termination as to when the joint venture actually terminates, the date when the Put or Call option comes into effect or if the parties still have ongoing obligations.",

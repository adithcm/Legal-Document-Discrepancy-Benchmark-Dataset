                "original_text": "The Initial Term of this Technical Infrastructure Maintenance Agreement is twelve months, commencing on the Effective Date. The support agreement will be subject to prior inspection and acceptance of the hardware for service and to the Customer's payment of any charges for the inspection and/or the pre-agreement servicing and repair of the hardware, such estimates to be approved in advance by Customer.",
                "changed_text": "The Initial Term of this Technical Infrastructure Maintenance Agreement is twelve months, commencing on the Effective Date. The support agreement will commence immediately, regardless of prior inspection or acceptance of the hardware for service. The customer's payment of any charges for the inspection and/or pre-agreement servicing and repair of the hardware is optional and at the customer's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text by stating that the support agreement commences immediately regardless of inspection or payment, whereas the original text explicitly makes the agreement subject to inspection, acceptance, and payment. This creates uncertainty about when the agreement is actually effective and the customer's obligations regarding pre-agreement services.",

MMMW's sole and exclusive obligation under this warranty shall be at its option to repair or exchange any hardware not in satisfactory operating condition. Said obligation shall be subject to the conditions and charges of Section 3, 4 and 5 and the prompt submission of (or notification to MMMW of the problem) the hardware to MMMW for service.",
                "changed_text": "MMMW warrants that the Technical Infrastructure may remain in satisfactory operating condition regardless of MMMW's inspection or the hardware's usage conditions. MMMW's obligation under this warranty is entirely at its discretion, with no guaranteed repair or exchange. This obligation is not subject to Sections 3, 4, or 5, and the customer is not required to promptly notify MMMW of any issues or submit hardware for service.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original warranty conditions. The original text specified that the warranty's validity was dependent on MMMW's continuous inspection and normal hardware usage. The modified text eliminates these requirements and makes MMMW's obligation entirely discretionary, creating ambiguity about the scope and enforceability of the warranty.",

All charges are subject to change by MMMW for the forthcoming period capped at the CPI annually, on thirty days written notice. MMMW reserves the right to apply [*] finance charges.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a clear payment term of 30 days, conditions for changing charges, and the right to apply finance charges. The modified clause removes the clarity of these terms. It makes invoicing discretionary, removes the payment deadline, eliminates the CPI cap on charge increases and notice requirement, and allows MMMW to arbitrarily apply or waive finance charges. This creates significant uncertainty regarding billing and payment obligations.",

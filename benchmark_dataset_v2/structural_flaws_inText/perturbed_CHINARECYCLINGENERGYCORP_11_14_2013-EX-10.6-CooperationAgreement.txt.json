The settlement date is the first day of the next month. Deducting the dues of Party A, Party B *may* pay Party A the energy saving service fee of the last month before the 15th of each month. Payment method: Party A will determine the payment method.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a definitive payment date. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating 'may' instead of 'should', suggesting that the payment is not guaranteed by the 15th. It is now up to Party A to decide the 'payment method' which could be different than 'wire or transfer', or the conditions where those payments methods would be authorized.",

The new text indicates Party B has a *shared* disposition right to the project, which creates an uncertainty because Party A also owned the CDQ during the contract period.

The \"Field of Use\" shall not include any functions or applications  not expressly described in the preceding sentence, but shall include functions or applications developed by Licensor to enhance the  performance within the \"Field of Use\".",

                "explanation": "The original text narrowly defines \"FIELD OF USE,\" limiting it to explicitly described functions for Spot FX transactions. The revised text broadens this definition to include any function or application, regardless of express description, creating a contradiction regarding the scope of permissible use. This uncertainty could lead to disputes about whether specific uses of the Licensed Technology are within the allowed scope.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that the Licensor assumes no responsibility or liability for the system's operations. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating that the Licensor *shall* assume responsibility and liability. This creates a significant contradiction regarding liability for the system's performance and operation. This would create great uncertainty about liability.",

                "explanation": "The original text prohibits the licensee from transfering or assigning their rights to a third party. The changed text continues this restriction, but then says under no circumstances will there be a transfer, *even* with the licensors permission.

                "explanation": "The definition of \"Agreement\" is changed to \"any agreement entered into by both parties, not exclusive to this agreement\" to conflict with the Preamble. The Preamble explicitly defines \"Agreement\" as *This* Manufacturing Agreement. This internal contradiction creates uncertainty about which agreements the term refers to. Additionally, the location where the definition of AMAG can be found has been changed.",

Commencing on the Effective Date and during the Term, AMAG is not required to purchase its requirements of Product(s), sample Products and Trainers for sale in the Territory from Antares.",
                "explanation": "Section 3.1(a) is modified so that Antares isn't obliged to supply all quantities of the products and AMAG is not required to purchase its requirements from Antares. This contradicts the original agreement that Antares *shall* supply and AMAG *shall* purchase their needs from Antares.",

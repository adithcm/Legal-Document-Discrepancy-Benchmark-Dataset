                "original_text": "Each party shall, and shall ensure that each member of its Group shall, (i) receive and hold the Company Information of the other Group in trust and in strictest confidence; (ii) protect such Company Information from disclosure and in no event take any action causing, or fail to take the action necessary in order to prevent, any such Company Information to lose its character as Company Information; (iii) exercise at a minimum the same care it would exercise to protect its own highly confidential information; and (iv) not use, reproduce, distribute, disclose, or otherwise disseminate the Company Information of the other Group, (A) except as authorized pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or (B) except pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or of law without similar restrictions or other protections against public disclosure; provided, however, with respect to disclosures pursuant to (B) above, the receiving party must first give written notice of such required disclosure to the disclosing party, take reasonable steps to allow the disclosing party to seek to protect the confidentiality of the Company Information required to be disclosed, make a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order requiring that the Company Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which disclosure is required, and shall disclose only that part of the Company Information which, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, it is required to disclose. In no event shall the receiving party exercise less than a reasonable standard of care to keep confidential the Company Information. Any and all reproductions of such Company Information must prominently contain a confidential legend.",

Any and all reproductions of such Company Information may contain a confidential legend.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict duty of confidentiality and the changed text relaxes it. By changing 'strictest confidence' to 'reasonable care' and removing the requirement to 'take reasonable steps to allow the disclosing party to seek to protect the confidentiality of the Company Information required to be disclosed', the enforceability of the confidentiality clause is diminished. The change from 'must' to 'may' further weakens the enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text creates a direct obligation for Certegy to fulfill its liabilities. By adding 'subject to available resources and market conditions,' Certegy can potentially avoid its obligations if it lacks resources or if market conditions are unfavorable. This introduces uncertainty and weakens the enforceability of the obligation.",

Except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Related Agreement, all assets and Liabilities were, or are being, transferred, assigned, licensed, assumed, or are being retained, on an \"AS IS,\" \"WHERE IS\" basis and the respective transferees, licensees and assignees will bear the economic and legal risks that any such conveyance (x) shall prove to be insufficient to vest in the transferee a title that is free and clear of any lien, claim or other encumbrance, or (y) shall not constitute an infringement of a third party's rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that assets are transferred on an \"AS IS, WHERE IS\" basis, meaning the recipients accept all risks associated with the transfer. The changed text introduces the possibility of 'discretionary compensation', contradicting the \"AS IS, WHERE IS\" principle. This creates uncertainty regarding the responsibilities and liabilities of both parties and the enforceability of the original agreement, where \"AS IS, WHERE IS\" stands.",

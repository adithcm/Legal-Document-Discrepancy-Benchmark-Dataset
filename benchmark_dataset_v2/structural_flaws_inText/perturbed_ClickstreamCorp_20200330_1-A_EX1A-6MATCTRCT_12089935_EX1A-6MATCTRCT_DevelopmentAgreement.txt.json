By either Party on provision of seven (7) days written notice to the other Party in case of a Force Majeure Event. 2. Client has the unilateral right to cancel this agreement at any time within a 7-day notice period. Further, Developer can only cancel due to lack of payment. Client will have a 30 day right to cure before a cancelation can occur. 3. By either Party for a material breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other Party, if the other Party's material breach is not cured within three (3) days of receipt of written notice thereof. This shall include any delays to the timeline specified in Exhibit A. 4.

                "explanation": "The changes introduce exceptions that contradict the original termination terms. Adding 'unless the client is facing financial hardship' to the developer's right to cancel creates ambiguity. Likewise, 'unless previously agreed upon' weakens the material breach clause. Introducing a '30-day review period' before termination for developer misconduct contradicts the 'at any time and without prior notice' clause.",

                "explanation": "Introducing 'subject to the Client's financial performance' and 'unless otherwise negotiated' adds uncertainty to the fixed payment schedule. Adding 'contingent on milestone approval' creates a subjective condition that can delay payment. Adding 'pending final audit' before the final payment also adds ambiguity and could allow for delayed or reduced payment. This introduces conflict regarding payment schedule.",

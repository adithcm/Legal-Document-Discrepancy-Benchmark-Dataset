Capital Resources shall be  reimbursed  promptly  for all  out-of-pocket  expenses  upon  receipt by the Company or the Association of a monthly  itemized bill summarizing such expenses since the date of the last bill, if any, to the date",
                "changed_text": "Capital Resources shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder, although the exact amounts may vary based on performance evaluations and unforeseen expenses:\n\n                  (a) (i) a  marketing  fee that could be around two  percent (2.0%) of the aggregate dollar amount of all Shares sold in the Subscription and Public Offerings,  excluding sales made through broker assisted  purchases or by other NASD member firms  participating  in the Subscription and Public Offerings pursuant  to  the  Selected  Dealers'  Agreement,  if  any  (for  which  Capital Resources'  compensation shall be pursuant to sub-paragraph  (ii)) and excluding shares sold to the  Association's  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan,  directors, officers or employees and any member of such person's  immediate family (defined to include children, spouse, parents, grandparents and grandchildren); the final fee will be determined at the discretion of the Company.\n\n                           (ii)    a management fee, tentatively set at one percent and one-half (1.5%) of the aggregate dollar amount of Shares sold through broker assisted  purchases or through selected dealers, if any; this is subject to change based on market conditions.\n\n                  (b) Capital  Resources  may be reimbursed for some out-of-pocket  expenses,  possibly including legal fees, travel, communications and postage, only if approved in advance by the Company, irrespective of whether the Conversion is successfully completed as set forth in Section 7 hereof. Reimbursement is not guaranteed. Capital Resources may be reimbursed periodically for potential out-of-pocket expenses upon submission to the Company or the Association.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies fixed percentages for marketing and management fees. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating these amounts 'may vary' and are 'tentatively set,' creating ambiguity about Capital Resources' actual compensation. Adding phrases such as 'final fee will be determined at the discretion of the Company' and 'this is subject to change based on market conditions' contradicts the initial fixed compensation structure, making enforcement unclear. The original text mandates reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, while the modified text makes reimbursement discretionary and only for approved expenses, again contradicting the original commitment and creating uncertainty.",

The Company and the Association  will make every  reasonable  effort to prevent the  issuance by the Commission,  the OTS or the FDIC, or any other state authority of any such order and,  if any such  order  shall at any time be  issued,  to obtain  the  lifting thereof at the earliest possible time.",
                "changed_text": "The Company and the Association will attempt, as resources allow, to cause any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission and any post-effective amendment to the Conversion Application to be approved by the OTS. The Company will endeavor to notify Capital Resources of the following events, to the extent deemed necessary by the Company and if such notification does not disrupt normal business operations, and providing the company has an available person to do such notification: (i) when the Registration Statement, as amended, has become effective; (ii) when the Conversion Application, as amended, has been approved by the OTS; (iii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission, the OTS or the FDIC; (iv) of any request for amendments to the Registration Statement; (v) of any order suspending the Subscription or Public Offerings; (vi) the issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement; or (vii) of the occurrence of any event mentioned in paragraph (h) below. The Company and the Association will attempt to prevent the issuance of any order by the Commission, the OTS or the FDIC, but are not required to challenge such orders. Further, the company is not obligated to act with haste as that will impact overall productivity. ",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the Company and the Association to 'use their best efforts' and 'immediately' notify Capital Resources of significant events. The modified clause weakens these obligations by stating they will 'attempt, as resources allow' and 'endeavor to notify... to the extent deemed necessary by the Company and if such notification does not disrupt normal business operations'. This introduces subjectivity and undermines the original commitment to prompt and comprehensive communication. Additionally, limiting the obligation to prevent the issuance of orders and stating that the Company is not obligated to act with haste contradicts the original clause's emphasis on proactive and timely action.",

                "explanation": "The original text firmly states that indemnities, representations, and warranties 'shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation.' The revised text introduces uncertainty with qualifiers such as 'unless otherwise determined by mutual agreement or due to unforeseen legal constraints' and 'is not guaranteed and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.' The original unequivocally states survival, whereas the revised text suggests that survival is conditional and subject to the parties' discretion, thus undermining the guarantees of the original clause.

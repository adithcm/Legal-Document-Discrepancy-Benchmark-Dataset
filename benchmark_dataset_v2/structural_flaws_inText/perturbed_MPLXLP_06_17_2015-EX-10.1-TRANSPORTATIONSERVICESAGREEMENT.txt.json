Product may also include liquefied petroleum gas commodities such as butane. Product, as designed in this Agreement, includes finished gasoline and diesel products.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly excludes finished gasoline and diesel products from the definition of 'Product.' The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that 'Product' includes finished gasoline and diesel products. This creates uncertainty about what commodities are covered under the agreement, impacting volume commitments and transportation charges.",

The modified text removes this option, making the renewal automatic and unconditional.

For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee's right and license to develop and distribute the Game in connection with the Property \"ICE AGE 2\" shall become non-exclusive after December 31, 2006.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall have the non-exclusive right and license to develop and distribute ICE AGE 2 Wireless Products during the Term of the Agreement for all Wireless Products set forth in this Paragraph 2(c) except the Game, for which Licensee may have the exclusive right and license to develop and distribute until December 31, 2006, subject to Fox’s approval. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee's right and license to develop and distribute the Game in connection with the Property \"ICE AGE 2\" shall remain exclusive indefinitely, unless otherwise stated by Fox.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Glu Mobile the exclusive right to develop and distribute the ICE AGE 2 game until December 31, 2006, after which it becomes non-exclusive. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating this exclusivity is \"subject to Fox’s approval\" and later stating that it shall remain exclusive indefinitely 'unless otherwise stated by Fox', which allows Fox to revoke this right at any time, directly contradicting the clearly defined timeline.",

                "explanation": "The original text sets a hard deadline for Fox not to develop/publish games from the ICE AGE 2 property before January 1, 2007. The modification creates a contradiction by making the deadline aspirational with “strive not to” while simultaneously giving Fox the unilateral right to disregard it with \"reserves the right to do so at its sole discretion.\" This creates uncertainty as to whether Fox is actually bound by the January 1, 2007 deadline.",

However, Fox reserves the right to pursue legal action for any perceived breaches of the Agreement at any time, regardless of this release.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states a mutual release of all claims arising under the agreement. The added sentence directly contradicts this by stating that Fox reserves the right to pursue legal action for perceived breaches, thus negating the mutuality and finality of the release. It casts doubt on the validity of the mutual release clause.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Fox develop, publish and/or distribute games derived from the Property \"ICE AGE 2\" prior to January 1, 2007.",
                "changed_text": "Fox hereby reserves the right to develop, publish and/or distribute (or grant a third party the right to develop, publish, and/or distribute) any wireless products or wireless content or any nature which may be derived from the property \"ICE AGE 2\". Notwithstanding the foregoing, Fox may develop, publish and/or distribute games derived from the Property \"ICE AGE 2\" at any time, subject to good faith negotiations with Licensee.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Fox will not develop games derived from \"ICE AGE 2\" before January 1, 2007. The modified text removes the date restriction and introduces ambiguity by stating that Fox 'may' develop such games 'at any time,' conditional only on 'good faith negotiations' with the Licensee, thus, creating contradiction about the time constraints of developing the games.",

The Guarantee Forfeiture Payment may be recouped from Licensee's sales of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product and the IDIOCRACY Wireless Product, as set forth in Paragraphs 2(a)(ii) and 2(b)(i) of this Amendment.",
                "changed_text": "Consistent with paragraph 15(c) of the Agreement, Licensee shall forfeit the Guarantee paid to date of ***** dollars (US$*****), and the requirement to pay the remaining Guarantee of ***** dollars (US$*****) will be subject to further negotiation between Fox and Licensee, equaling a potential total Guarantee payment by Licensee to Fox of ***** dollars (US$*****) (\"Guarantee Forfeiture Payment\"). The Guarantee Forfeiture Payment may, at Fox's discretion, be recouped from Licensee's sales of any Wireless Products, as determined by Fox.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Licensee 'shall' forfeit and immediately pay the remaining guarantee. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating that the remaining payment is 'subject to further negotiation'. Furthermore, it alters the recoupment from specific products to 'any Wireless Products, as determined by Fox', which creates a contradiction in the guarantee payment's terms and its recoupment.",

The obligations set forth in this Amendment remain in effect unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. All claims arising under the Agreement are presumed released, but Fox reserves the right to pursue claims related to intellectual property infringement.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a mutual release of all claims, except for royalty payments and the obligations in the Amendment. The modified text undermines the 'mutual release' by stating that royalty payments for 'some' Wireless Products may remain, which contradicts the initial comprehensive release. It further introduces Fox's right to pursue IP infringement claims, thus, creates a contradiction regarding the scope of the release.",

Fleet shall not do or permit or cause anything to be done whereby Columbia's rights in and title to the Columbia Equipment are or may become prejudiced including, without limitation, by ensuring that Columbia Equipment are clearly marked as the property of Columbia.

The modified version contradicts this by stating that Fleet may move items without any consent. This creates uncertainty about Fleet's ability to relocate equipment.",

During the Term, the purchase price for each Batch purchased by Columbia from Fleet in any [***] shall be determined in accordance with Part 1 of Exhibit A and the pricing model set out in Part 2 of Exhibit A attached hereto, as may be amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.1. The Parties shall agree the applicable purchase price for each [***] in accordance with Part 1 of Exhibit A (as may be amended from time to time in accordance with this Section 5.1) and the production forecasts received by Fleet pursuant to Section 3.1. [***]. Any adjustments as set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) below and any consequent adjustments to the volume discount model set out in Part 1 of Exhibit A and/or the pricing model set out in Part 2 of Exhibit A shall be agreed in writing by both Parties and shall take effect from 1 January the following calendar year. Exhibit A may be amended by the mutual written agreement of both parties as follows:",

During the Term, the purchase price for each Batch purchased by Columbia from Fleet in any [***] shall be determined solely by Fleet and unilaterally changed without consent from Columbia. Fleet will try to consult with Columbia in good faith. Any adjustments as set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) below and any consequent adjustments to the volume discount model set out in Part 1 of Exhibit A and/or the pricing model set out in Part 2 of Exhibit A will be determined unilaterally by Fleet. Exhibit A may be amended at Fleet's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires agreement and mutual adjustments of price between parties. The modified text allows Fleet to unilaterally decide and change the price. This creates direct in-text contradiction within Section 5.1 and shifts bargaining power. Fleet has no need of Columbia's permission, destroying the bilateral nature of the contract.",

                "changed_text": "9. Term and Renewal. The term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year, commencing January 1, 2008 and ending on December 31, 2008. This Agreement shall automatically renew for subsequent one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "This change adds an automatic renewal clause, making the contract perpetually renewed unless actively terminated. This could contradict any future verbal agreements or understandings of a one-time sponsorship, creating uncertainty about the intended duration.",

In consideration of the services to be rendered under this Agreement as set forth above, the Company shall be  entitled to compensation in the amount of $150,000.00 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars), to be paid in equal installments of $37,500.00  (Thirty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars) on January 1, 2008, April 1, 2008, July 1, 2008 and October 1, 2008. If Cano fails to make any  payment when required by this Agreement, the Company shall have the option of canceling this Agreement following the passage of ten  (10) days after having given Cano written notice of its default. While the Company shall have no further obligation to Cano following  cancellation of the Agreement, Cano shall remain liable for all unpaid installments for the then current term of the Agreement, which  installments shall be immediately due and payable.",
                "changed_text": "15. Payment of Money. In consideration of the services to be rendered under this Agreement as set forth above, the Company shall be  entitled to compensation in the amount of $150,000.00 (One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars), to be paid according to a schedule to be mutually agreed upon by both parties before January 1, 2008. If Cano fails to make any  payment when required by this Agreement, the Company shall have the option of canceling this Agreement following the passage of ten  (10) days after having given Cano written notice of its default. Upon cancellation, Cano's payment obligations shall be subject to negotiation between both parties.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the defined payment schedule with a 'mutually agreed upon' schedule that has to be agreed on before the start date. This contradicts the explicitly stated schedule of payments provided. It also replaces the guarantee of full payment after cancellation with 'negotiation', making the financial commitment uncertain. It also fails to clarify what happens if no agreement is made.",

                "explanation": "While the first sentence states that assignment needs prior consent, the second sentence allows Cano to assign the agreement to a subsidiary without consent. This introduces a clear contradiction on the conditions required to assign the agreement, making it unclear if consent is universally required or not.",

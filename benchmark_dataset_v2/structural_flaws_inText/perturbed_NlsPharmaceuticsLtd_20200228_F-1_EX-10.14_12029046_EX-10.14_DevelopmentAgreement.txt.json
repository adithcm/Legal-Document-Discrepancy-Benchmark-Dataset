                "original_text": "When used in this Agreement in capital letters, the terms and abbreviations set forth below, whether used in the singular or plural, shall have the following meaning: Affiliates means any company, enterprise, corporation or business entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, either the Licensor or Licensee. For this purpose, \"control\" shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through holding a majority of the voting rights of the entity, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "When used in this Agreement in capital letters, the terms and abbreviations set forth below, whether used in the singular or plural, shall have the following meaning: Affiliates means any company, enterprise, corporation or business entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, either the Licensor or Licensee. For this purpose, \"control\" shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to influence the management and policies of an entity. Such influence need not be decisive and may be exerted through various means, including but not limited to holding any percentage of voting rights or contractual agreements.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliates' specifies control as the 'power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through holding a majority of the voting rights of the entity, by contract or otherwise.' The modified definition contradicts this by stating that 'control' means the 'power to influence' which 'need not be decisive' and includes 'any percentage of voting rights.' This creates ambiguity because it's unclear whether entities with only minor influence or a small percentage of voting rights can be considered Affiliates, thus affecting the rights and obligations associated with Affiliates throughout the contract.",

                "changed_text": "The Licensee shall endeavor to make the first commercial sale of the Licensed Product in the Territory within a reasonable timeframe after receipt of marketing authorization in a given country of the Territory. The definition of 'reasonable timeframe' shall be determined at the sole discretion of the Licensee, taking into account market conditions and internal strategic considerations.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'best commercial efforts' within 'twelve (12) months.' The modified text replaces this with a 'reasonable timeframe' defined by the Licensee's 'sole discretion.' This creates a contradiction: one section sets a specific, objectively measurable deadline, while the other allows the Licensee to indefinitely delay commercialization based on their own subjective assessment. This contradiction weakens the Licensor's ability to enforce timely commercialization.",

The Licensee shall execute and deliver all reasonably necessary signatures and/or documents and take any further steps (or have his employees, agents and officers do the same) to the extent necessary to make any Developed Intellectual Property the sole property of the Licensor. The Licensee shall have right to use the Developed Intellectual Property for exploiting its rights granted in this Agreement until its expiration or termination as set forth in Article 19 hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "All right, title and interest in and to any Developed Intellectual Property shall vest in and belong jointly to the Licensor and Licensee. The specific allocation of ownership rights to Developed Intellectual Property shall be determined on a case-by-case basis through mutual agreement between the Licensor and Licensee, documented in a separate written agreement. The Licensee shall have right to use the Developed Intellectual Property for exploiting its rights granted in this Agreement until its expiration or termination as set forth in Article 19 hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that all Developed Intellectual Property belongs solely to the Licensor. The modified version introduces a contradiction by stating that it belongs jointly to both parties, with the specific allocation to be determined later. This creates uncertainty about ownership rights and enforcement, as it is unclear until a separate agreement is reached who owns what, making it difficult to protect and enforce those rights.",

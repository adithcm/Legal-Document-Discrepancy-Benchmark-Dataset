The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of 1 year after the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated as set forth herein (the \"TERM\"). This Agreement shall renew for successive 1-year periods, after the initial 1 Year Term, if agreed by both parties in writing within 30 days of license expiration. Either party may terminate the Agreement on 60-days written notice during a renewed term. However, in no event shall termination of this Agreement by MediaNet Group Technologies relieve it of the obligation to remit payment to Reseller for sales or Portals, Hosting Services or other products and services to or through Buyers contracted by Reseller prior to such termination. The obligation to remit payment cease 30 days after termination of this Agreement.",

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of 1 year after the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated as set forth herein (the \"TERM\"). This Agreement shall automatically renew for successive 1-year periods, after the initial 1 Year Term. Either party may terminate the Agreement on 60-days written notice during the initial term. After any renewal, termination requires mutual written consent by both parties, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. However, in no event shall termination of this Agreement by MediaNet Group Technologies relieve it of the obligation to remit payment to Reseller for sales or Portals, Hosting Services or other products and services to or through Buyers contracted by Reseller prior to such termination. The obligation to remit payment cease 30 days after termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that renewal requires agreement by both parties in writing. The changed text implies automatic renewal and makes termination after renewal subject to mutual written consent. This contradicts the initial one-year term termination clause and the term \"automatic renewal\" introduction, creating uncertainty regarding the termination process and the agreement term.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that no commission is paid on freeware. The added sentence introduces an exception where commission MAY be paid at MediaNet's discretion based on performance, directly contradicting the 'no commission' statement. This creates ambiguity regarding when and to whom commissions on freeware will be paid.",

Unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated, Metavante shall provide a written renewal notice to Customer at least twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the Initial Term (the \"Renewal Notice\"). Unless Customer notifies Metavante of its intent not to renew this Agreement in writing within a period of three (3) months following the Renewal Notice, this Agreement shall automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term on the same terms (including pricing terms) for one (1) twelve-month period. Upon expiration of such twelve (12) -month extension, this Agreement shall expire unless renewed in writing by the parties, provided, however, that Metavante may, but has no obligation to, continue to provide all or any portion of the Services thereafter on a month-to-month basis subject to these Terms and Conditions and Metavante's then-current standard fees and charges.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates an in-text contradiction in the renewal terms. The original text states that the contract auto-renews if the customer does not cancel. The modified text suggests no automatic renewal. This contradiction introduces uncertainty around renewal conditions.",

In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to Metavante any amortized but unpaid one-time set-up fees, enhancement fees or implementation fees and all reasonable costs in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts exclusively related to Metavante's performance of the Services under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the payment of termination fees upon termination for convenience. The modified text adds uncertainty to the termination fee by using 'may not be required', which contradicts the prior text's assertion. This can result in disputes over termination costs.",

All such Customer Data and other Confidential Information shall, however, be subject to regulation and examination by the appropriate auditors and regulatory agencies to the same extent as if such information were on Customer's premises.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'may also be owned or co-owned by Metavante' the clause creates a contradiction regarding the Customer's ownership of Customer Data. The modified section introduces ambiguity on the sole ownership, which causes conflict on ownership.",

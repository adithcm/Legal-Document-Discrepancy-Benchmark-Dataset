Unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated, Metavante shall provide a written renewal notice to Customer at least twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the Initial Term (the \"Renewal Notice\"). Unless Customer notifies Metavante of its intent not to renew this Agreement in writing within a period of three (3) months following the Renewal Notice, this Agreement shall automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term on the same terms (including pricing terms) for one (1) twelve-month period. Upon expiration of such twelve (12) -month extension, this Agreement shall expire unless renewed in writing by the parties, provided, however, that Metavante may, but has no obligation to, continue to provide all or any portion of the Services thereafter on a month-to-month basis subject to these Terms and Conditions and Metavante's then-current standard fees and charges.",

                "explanation": "The payment terms are contradicted by modifying the payment timing of the monthly base fee from \"in advance\" to \"in arrears,\" changing the due date for other amounts payable from thirty (30) to sixty (60) days, and stating that the charges will not be subject to annual interest rate. This creates conflict regarding payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement stipulated that the Termination Fee should be paid *prior* to the termination date. It also clearly stated that amortized fees had to be paid on termination. This is now contradicted by noting that the fee *may* be paid after termination, amortized fees will not be paid, and the formula for calculating termination fees have been altered. This contradicts the payment deadlines.",

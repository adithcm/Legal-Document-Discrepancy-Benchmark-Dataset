This Agreement will automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless either party notifies the other at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable, of its intention not to renew this Agreement.",

Renewal is not guaranteed and is subject to mutual agreement by both parties no less than 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable. If no agreement is made, this agreement will be terminated.",
                "explanation": "Section 8.1 originally implied an automatic renewal unless canceled. The modified version makes renewal subject to mutual agreement, contradicting the original implication and creating uncertainty about the renewal process. One section implies automatic renewal, while another requires explicit agreement.",

The revised version removes this restriction, stating VerticalNet is *not* bound by any non-compete after termination.

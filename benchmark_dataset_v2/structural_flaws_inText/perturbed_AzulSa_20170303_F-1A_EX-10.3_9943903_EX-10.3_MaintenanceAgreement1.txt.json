SECURITY DEPOSIT\n\n13.1 As per provisions of Clause 17 (\"Conditions precedent\"), and unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Company shall pay the Security Deposit to the Repairer in an amount equal to the aggregate of:\n (i) [*****], as per Exhibit 14 (\"Price conditions\"); and,\n (ii) [*****] of the value of the Stock.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the global amount of Security Deposit payable at the time of the Signing Date shall be [*****].\n 13.2 Such Security Deposit shall be constituted either, as follows, at the option of the Company:\n (i) a cash deposit by SWIFT wire transfer to the bank account indicated in Clause 12.2 (iv); or,\n\n (ii) one (1) LOC with a validity of at least [*****], acceptable to the Repairer acting reasonably. Such LOC shall be renewed and its confirmation extended, at the latest [*****] before the expiry of each previous LOC; all costs incurred as a result of the issuance and confirmation of the LOC shall be borne by the Company.\n\nIt is agreed that the Security Deposit must be available for the period ending [*****] after the Term; such Security Deposit shall be the property of the Repairer and shall be non-refundable except as set out in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "13. SECURITY DEPOSIT\n\n13.1 As per provisions of Clause 17 (\"Conditions precedent\"), and unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Company *may* pay a Security Deposit to the Repairer. The amount, if any, will be determined at the Repairer's sole discretion based on the Company's creditworthiness and payment history.\n\n13.2 If a Security Deposit is deemed necessary by the Repairer, it *may* be constituted as follows, at the Repairer's discretion:\n (i) a cash deposit by SWIFT wire transfer to the bank account indicated in Clause 12.2 (iv); or,\n\n (ii) one (1) LOC with a validity determined by the Repairer. If an LOC is used, it may or may not need to be renewed, as decided by the Repairer. All costs, *if applicable*, will be borne by the Company.\n\nIt is agreed that a Security Deposit, *if required*, is non-refundable under any circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the Company *shall* pay a Security Deposit, creating a definite obligation. The modified clause changes this to *may*, making the payment discretionary. It also removes the clear process for calculation of the deposit, and states it is non-refundable under *any* circumstances contradicting potential refund scenarios mentioned elsewhere, creating uncertainty and favoring the Repairer. In the original agreement it also states that if the LOC is not renewed or extended as per the terms of Clause 13.2, the cash deposit shall become immediately due and payable and the Repairer shall be entitled to draw such LOC, in order for the Repairer to receive an amount equal to the Security Deposit. However, the modified text creates contradiction for that term.",

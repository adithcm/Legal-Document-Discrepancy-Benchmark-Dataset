                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Territory\" limits the reseller's activities to a specific geographic region defined in Exhibit D. By changing the definition to \"the entire world, without limitation,\" we create a contradiction. Sections of the agreement that rely on the original, limited definition (such as clauses regarding marketing efforts or non-compete obligations) now conflict with this unlimited definition. This introduces uncertainty about where the reseller is authorized to operate and which markets are protected by the agreement.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by first removing the need for mutual agreement and specified territories (as the territory has been modified to encompass the entire world), and secondly by explicitly stating that meeting the Quotas is not essential and does not constitute grounds for termination, which directly contradicts the original text. This weakens TouchStar's ability to enforce performance standards and creates uncertainty about the reseller's obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original non-compete clause, and references Section 1, which redefined the territory. Initially, the Reseller was prohibited from selling competing software or obtaining it from entities other than TouchStar. The modified version now allows the Reseller to sell competing products, obtain software from other entities, and actively solicit customers, even within TouchStar's original, albeit overwritten, territory. This creates a direct conflict with the intended exclusivity and introduces significant uncertainty about the Reseller's obligations and TouchStar's protections.",

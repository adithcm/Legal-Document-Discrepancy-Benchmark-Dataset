Each Annual Marketing Plan developed by Reseller           during the term of this Agreement and any extension thereof shall           contain quotas mutually agreed between TouchStar and Reseller for the           sale by Reseller of TouchStar Software and Support Services in the           Territory for the year to which such Annual Marketing Plan relates           (the \"Quotas\"). Reseller acknowledges that meeting the Quotas is an           essential element of this Agreement and that this Agreement may be           terminated by TouchStar if, in TouchStar's reasonable opinion,           Reseller will not meet the Quotas during the Term or any extension           thereof.",

Each Annual Marketing Plan developed by Reseller           during the term of this Agreement and any extension thereof shall           contain quotas proposed by Reseller. TouchStar may, at its sole discretion, accept or reject these quotas. Reseller's performance relative to these quotas will be considered, but will not be a strict condition for the continuation or termination of the agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the performance quotas are essential elements and are mutually agreed upon. The modified clause makes the quotas proposed by Reseller, which TouchStar may reject or accept. Furthermore, it states that whether or not the quotas are met is not a strict condition for the termination of the agreement. This introduces an internal contradiction, creating uncertainty about the quotas' significance and enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed term of 12 months with a 15-day notice period for termination by TouchStar. The modified text introduces the phrase 'may not exceed' regarding the 12-month term, suggesting a possible shorter term at TouchStar's discretion. It then removes the requirement for prior written notice for termination, directly contradicting the original provision. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement and the conditions for termination.",

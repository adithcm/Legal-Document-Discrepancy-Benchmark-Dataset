As used herein, the \"Term\" means the Initial Term and any Extension Term(s).",

As used herein, the \"Term\" means the Initial Term and any Extension Term(s).",

The changed text makes the accounting statement optional (\"may receive, if available\") and the remittance subject to THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION's discretion, creating uncertainty about whether revenue sharing will actually occur as originally agreed.",

Moreover, any party hereto may disclose any Confidential Information hereunder to such party's agents, attorneys and other representatives or any court or competent jurisdiction or any other party empowered hereunder as reasonably required to resolve any dispute between the parties hereto. Both parties agree all aspects of this contract are confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party.",

The changed text allows the contract's terms and conditions to be disclosed at the discretion of either party, directly contradicting the original confidentiality agreement. This undermines the purpose of the confidentiality clause and creates legal ambiguity.",

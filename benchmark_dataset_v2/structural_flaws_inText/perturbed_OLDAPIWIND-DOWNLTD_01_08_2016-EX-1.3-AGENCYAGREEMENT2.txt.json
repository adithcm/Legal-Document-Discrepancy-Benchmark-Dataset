                "changed_text": "(iii) immediately prior to offering the Securities to persons in the United States, we had reasonable grounds to believe that each such person may or may not be an Accredited Investor, and on the date hereof, we make no guarantees that each such offeree purchasing Securities from the Corporation is an Accredited Investor;",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that the agent believed each offeree was an Accredited Investor. The modified text removes that certainty by stating the agent believes the offeree may or may not be an Accredited Investor and offers no guarantees. This creates uncertainty as to whether the agent performed the necessary due diligence to ensure compliance with securities laws. The change in 'did believe that each such person was' to 'that each such person may or may not be' is a direct contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original statement that the offering was conducted 'in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement'. By stating it was conducted 'irrespective of the terms of the Agency Agreement', the modified text creates a conflict. This could lead to disputes about whether the agent violated the agreement.",

The modified text now implies that some of the relevant parties may be subject to a disqualification event.

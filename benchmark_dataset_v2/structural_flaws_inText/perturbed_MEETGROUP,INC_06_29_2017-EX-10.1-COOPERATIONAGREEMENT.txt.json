                "explanation": "Section 3(a)(iii) originally limited the Investor Group's acquisition of additional securities to a threshold of 10% of the outstanding Common Stock. By changing this limit to 20%, I've introduced a contradiction. The agreement is built around the premise that the Investor Group will not exceed a certain ownership threshold to maintain a balance of power and influence. Now, they can potentially acquire twice as many shares. In this modification, it creates a conflict regarding what constitutes an acceptable level of investor influence and control, because if Investor Group had 10-20% of Company's Shares, it might affect other shareholders' votes.",

                "explanation": "Section 15 establishes Jeffrey B. Osher as the Investor Group Representative, granting him authority to act on behalf of all investors. By adding the sentence \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Investor may individually revoke the authority of the Investor Group Representative with respect to its own shares, provided that notice of such revocation is given to the Company,\" I've created a contradiction. This allows individual investors to undermine the Representative's authority, creating uncertainty about his actual power and introducing the possibility of conflicting instructions to the Company. This makes the Representative's role uncertain. Also, what would happen if other Investors did not agree with such decision? This creates a legal dispute between them.",

                "explanation": "Section 23 states that amendments require agreement from all parties. By adding \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may unilaterally amend Exhibit A to include additional director candidates without the consent of the Investors,\" I create a contradiction. This grants the Company the power to change a key part of the agreement (the list of director candidates) without investor consent, conflicting with the initial requirement for mutual agreement. This gives the Company more power in deciding whom to elect into Board, which may not be aligned with Investors.",

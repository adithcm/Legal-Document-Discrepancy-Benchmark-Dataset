Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period by written amendment to this Agreement. All amendments to this Agreement must be signed by all parties to this Agreement.",

Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period at the Company's sole discretion, without requiring a written amendment to this Agreement. The Company may, at any time, remove a product from the list of Licensed Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that adding other products requires a written amendment signed by all parties. The modified version contradicts this by stating that the Company can add other products at its sole discretion without amendment. It further adds that the company has the right to remove a product at any time from the list, making the initial list meaningless, and creating uncertainty about which products are actually 'Licensed Products' at any given time, thereby impacting royalties and obligations.",

Where the following per Unit conversion may apply for the term of this Agreement:",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a $0.05 donation per unit sold, payable quarterly. The modified version makes the donation contingent on the Company's profitability and its sole discretion, removing the mandatory aspect and creating uncertainty regarding whether donations will be made at all. Furthermore, it makes the distribution to the chapter at any time, so it creates uncertainty about consistent income.",

This change directly contradicts that by giving the Company the right to allocate the donation to ANY charity without notice, or discontinue donations at any time.

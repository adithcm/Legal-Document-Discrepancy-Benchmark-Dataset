The term \"Studio Lease\" means that certain Lease dated as of February 23, 1996 of certain real estate located on the 7th Floor of an office building located at 395 Hudson St., New York, New York.",

The term \"Studio Lease\" means that certain Lease dated as of February 23, 1996 of certain real estate located on the 7th Floor of an office building located at 395 Hudson St., New York, New York.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear end date for the agreement. The modified version changes the term to \"continue indefinitely,\" directly contradicting the initially defined term and creates ambiguity. Now the end date is not clear.",

The modified text introduces an option for the non-defaulting party to 'ignore the default and continue the agreement indefinitely,' directly contradicting the right to terminate. This makes enforcement of the default clause uncertain.",

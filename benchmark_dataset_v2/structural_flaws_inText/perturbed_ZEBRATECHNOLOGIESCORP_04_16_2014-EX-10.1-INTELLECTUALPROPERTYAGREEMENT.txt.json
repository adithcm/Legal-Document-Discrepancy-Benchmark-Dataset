Schedules 1.1(b) and 1.1(c) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule collectively set forth a complete and accurate list of all registered, issued, or applied-for Intellectual Property that constitutes Acquired Company IP and Schedules 1.1(h), 1.1(l), and 1.1(n) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule collectively set forth a complete and accurate list of all registered, issued, or applied-for Intellectual Property that constitutes Assigned IP (such Acquired Company IP and Assigned IP, collectively, the \"Registered Intellectual Property\"). For each listed item, each of Schedule 1.1(b), 1.1(c), 1.1(h), 1.1(l), and 1.1(n) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, indicates, as applicable, each owner of each such item of Registered Intellectual Property, the jurisdictions in which each such item of Registered Intellectual Property has been issued or registered or in which any application for such issuance or registration has been filed, the registration or application number, and the application filing or registration dates thereof. Each such item of Registered Intellectual Property is subsisting and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, valid and enforceable (except with respect to applications for Intellectual Property). A Seller Party has sufficient right, title, and interest in and to the Licensed IP to grant the licenses granted under this IP Agreement with respect thereto.",

Schedules 1.1(b) and 1.1(c) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule may set forth a list of registered, issued, or applied-for Intellectual Property that may constitute Acquired Company IP and Schedules 1.1(h), 1.1(l), and 1.1(n) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule may set forth a list of registered, issued, or applied-for Intellectual Property that may constitute Assigned IP (such Acquired Company IP and Assigned IP, collectively, the \"Registered Intellectual Property\").

The enforceability of Registered Intellectual Property is not guaranteed. A Seller Party may or may not have sufficient right, title, and interest in and to the Licensed IP to grant the licenses granted under this IP Agreement with respect thereto.",
                "explanation": "The original text asserts that the Seller has marketable title to the Assigned IP and Acquired Company IP, and that the schedules are accurate. The modified version introduces uncertainty by weakening these statements. The phrases \"believed to be owned\", \"provides no guarantee\", \"may set forth\", \"may indicate\", \"enforceability is not guaranteed\", and \"may or may not have\" contradict the original assertions and create doubt regarding the actual ownership, accuracy, and enforceability of the listed IP.",

Nothing herein shall preclude any party from seeking damages or other remedies at law or in equity (other than termination of this IP Agreement or any license to any Intellectual Property granted under this IP Agreement) for any breach hereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the licenses are irrevocable and may not be terminated, with limited exceptions. The modified version contradicts this by introducing \"except under unforeseen circumstances\" and emphasizing the potential for termination in the event of a material breach, undermining the original statement. The inclusion of the statement that a court of law can terminate even if irrevocable creates ambiguity. By introducing potential judicial override, the certainty of the irrevocability clause is diminished, and the rights granted are no longer as secure.",

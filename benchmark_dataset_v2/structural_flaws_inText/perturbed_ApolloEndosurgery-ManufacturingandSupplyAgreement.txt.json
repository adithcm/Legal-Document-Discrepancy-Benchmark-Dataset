APOLLO shall deliver to ESTABLISHMENT a forecast for anticipated monthly deliveries of Product to APOLLO over the subsequent four (4) calendar quarters (the \"Forecast\"). The Forecast is to be used by the Parties for planning purposes and is not a commitment by APOLLO to purchase the quantities of Products specified in such Forecast, except as described below.\n\nThe quantities of Product forecasted for the initial three (3) months of each updated rolling Forecast shall represent a binding obligation of Apollo to purchase from ESTABLISHMENT, and of ESTABLISHMENT to manufacture and supply to APOLLO, such quantities of Product.\n\nESTABLISHMENT shall, at all times during the Term, maintain an inventory of raw materials and components sufficient to manufacture the binding obligations.",

The Forecast is to be used by the Parties for planning purposes and is not a commitment by APOLLO to purchase the quantities of Products specified in such Forecast, except as described below.\n\nThe quantities of Product forecasted for the initial three (3) months of each updated rolling Forecast may represent a binding obligation of Apollo to purchase from ESTABLISHMENT, and of ESTABLISHMENT to manufacture and supply to APOLLO, such quantities of Product. The specifics of this obligation will be determined on a quarterly basis, based on Apollo's budgetary approvals, and communicated to Establishment Labs in writing. In the absence of such written commitment, the forecast will not be binding.\n\nESTABLISHMENT shall not be required to maintain any specific inventory of raw materials and components.",
                "explanation": "The original text established a binding obligation for Apollo to purchase the forecasted quantities for the first three months. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that this obligation \"may\" be binding and is contingent on Apollo's budgetary approvals and written communication. This directly contradicts the original binding commitment. Also, Establishment Labs is no longer required to maintain any raw materials which again contradicts the original text.",

Each Party agrees not to use the Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose, including trading in the financial instruments of the other Party, except in its performance under this Agreement. In addition, the receiving Party shall treat and protect such Confidential Information in the same manner as it treats its own information of like character, but with not less than reasonable care. The receiving Party agrees to take appropriate measures by instruction and/or written agreement prior to disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees and contractors to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure. Confidential Information may be disclosed to the extent necessary to comply with an order of an administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction provided, however, that the Party so required to disclose Confidential Information shall provide prior written notice thereof to the other Party in sufficient time to enable that Party to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure. The receiving Party's confidentiality obligations under this Article 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and shall remain binding on the Parties hereto until the earlier of a) the Confidential Information falls within one of the exceptions stated in Section 9.1 and b) five (5) years from the expiration or termination of the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text established that each party shall treat and protect confidential information with not less than reasonable care, but the changed text states that each party will treat the confidential information in a manner it deems appropriate which is less strict and creates the possibility to treat the confidential information with less protection. Also, the original states that the receiving party agrees to take appropriate measures by instruction and/or written agreement prior to disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees and contractors to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure; however, the modified text removes that stipulation. Finally, the original text states that the confidentiality obligations shall survive the termination of the agreement; however, the modified text removes that stipulation.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly says that the payment term is thirty (30) days but the modified text changes that to sixty (60) days which directly conflicts with the original text.

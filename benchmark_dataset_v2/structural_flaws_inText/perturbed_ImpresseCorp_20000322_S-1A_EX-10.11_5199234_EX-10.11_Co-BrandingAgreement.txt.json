Except as otherwise set forth herein, neither party shall transfer, assign or cede any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent may be withheld at the other party's reasonable business discretion; provided, however, that either party may transfer this Agreement without prior written consent of the other to an Affiliate of such party, or to the surviving party in a merger or consolidation, or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of its assets.",

Except as otherwise set forth herein, neither party shall transfer, assign or cede any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent may be withheld at the other party's reasonable business discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may freely assign this Agreement to any third party at any time without notice or consent. ",
                "explanation": "The original text prohibits assignment without consent, except in specific cases. The modified text adds a contradictory sentence allowing free assignment to any third party, negating the previous restriction and creating uncertainty about the assignment terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that confidentiality obligations survive for three years. The modified text states these obligations do not survive termination at all. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the duration of confidentiality post-termination.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, VerticalNet shall have the right to terminate this agreement at any time with or without cause.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates specific conditions and a cure period for termination due to breach. The addition of a clause granting VerticalNet the right to terminate \"at any time with or without cause\" directly contradicts the initial provision, creating ambiguity regarding the actual termination rights and rendering the cure period potentially meaningless for VerticalNet.",

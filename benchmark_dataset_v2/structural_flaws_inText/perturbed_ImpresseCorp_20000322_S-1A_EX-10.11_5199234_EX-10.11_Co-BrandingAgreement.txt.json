                "changed_text": "1.20. TERM shall have the meaning set forth in Section 5.1  [TERMINATION AND RENEWAL]\n\n5.1. The Term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the contract term was defined as fifteen months. By adding an automatic renewal clause, we introduce a contradiction. It is now unclear if the contract ends after fifteen months or automatically renews, creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration.",

Subject to Section 10.11  [SURVIVAL], upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing party or, at the request of the disclosing party, destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement. Subject to Section 7.6  [USER DATA], the confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.",

Subject to Section 7.6  [USER DATA], the confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall survive termination of this Agreement indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that confidentiality obligations last for three years after termination. The modified clause states that they last indefinitely. This creates uncertainty regarding the duration of confidentiality obligations, as it is unclear whether the parties are bound by a three-year limit or a perpetual one.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows assignment to affiliates and in cases of merger/acquisition without consent. The modified clause allows assignment to affiliates, but then contradicts itself by saying that in case of merger and acquisition require prior written consent. This creates confusion about the conditions under which assignment is allowed.",

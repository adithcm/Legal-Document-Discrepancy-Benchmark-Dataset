                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "B. Guarantors shall unconditionally guarantee full performance and discharge by Master Franchisee of all the obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement at the times and in the manner therein provided.",
                "changed_text": "B. Guarantors shall guarantee performance by Master Franchisee of the obligations under the Master Franchise Agreement. However, the extent of the guarantee is limited to 50% of the total obligations, and is further contingent upon Master Franchisee maintaining good standing with local business regulatory organizations.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. Initially, the guarantee was 'unconditional' and for 'full performance'. The modified clause introduces conditions and limitations to the guarantee, creating uncertainty about the guarantor's obligations. This could impact enforcement since it's now unclear to what extent the guarantors are liable.",

            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "E. Without affecting the Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor, without notice to the Guarantors, may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Guarantors waive notice of amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement and notice of demand for payment or performance by Master Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "E. The Franchisor may not extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee without prior written consent from the Guarantors. If such a modification is undertaken without the Guarantors' explicit consent, the Guarantors' obligations under this guarantee may be terminated at their discretion. Any action taken by Franchisor that impacts Master Franchisee must be communicated to Guarantors within three business days. Guarantors reserve the right to seek legal remedies if any change is enacted without explicit approval.",
                "explanation": "This section originally allowed the Franchisor to modify the Master Franchisee's obligations without notifying the Guarantors, and the Guarantors waived notice. The modified clause flips this entirely, requiring prior written consent from the Guarantors for any modifications. This contradicts the original intent and could lead to disputes over the validity of the guarantee if modifications are made without consent. The threat of legal remedies creates further uncertainty.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "F. Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect, and shall be unaffected by: (1) the unenforceability of the Master Franchise Agreement against Master Franchisee; (2) the termination of any obligations of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement by operation of law or otherwise; (3) the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or other liquidation of Master Franchisee, including, without limitation, any surrender or disclaimer of the Franchise Agreement by the trustee in bankruptcy of Master Franchisee; (4) Franchisor's consent or acquiescence to any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, or any other creditor's proceedings of or against Master Franchisee, or by the winding-up or dissolution of Master Franchisee, or any other event or occurrence which would have the effect at law of terminating the existence of Master Franchisee's obligations prior to the termination of the Master Franchise Agreement; or (5) by any other agreements or other dealings between Franchisor and Master Franchisee having the effect of amending or altering the Master Franchise Agreement or Master Franchisee's obligations under this Guarantee, or by any want of notice by Franchisor to Master Franchisee of any default of Master Franchisee or by any other matter, thing, act, or omission of Franchisor whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "F. Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect, unless the Master Franchise Agreement becomes unenforceable against Master Franchisee due to circumstances beyond the Master Franchisee's control, such as changes in local laws or regulations. In the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or other liquidation of Master Franchisee, the Guarantors' obligations may be reviewed and potentially reduced based on the assessed financial impact. If the Franchisor consents or acquiesces to any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, or any other creditor's proceedings of or against Master Franchisee without first seeking consent from the Guarantors, then the Guarantors' obligations will be automatically terminated.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original provision that the Guarantors' obligations are unaffected by several specific events, including unenforceability, termination of obligations, bankruptcy, and the Franchisor's actions regarding insolvency. The modified clause introduces exceptions to this, making the Guarantors' obligations contingent on these same events. Specifically, obligations now are dependent on 'circumstances beyond Master Franchisee's control' and can be reduced based on bankruptcy, and terminated if the Franchisor acts without consent in matters of insolvency. This makes enforcement uncertain.",

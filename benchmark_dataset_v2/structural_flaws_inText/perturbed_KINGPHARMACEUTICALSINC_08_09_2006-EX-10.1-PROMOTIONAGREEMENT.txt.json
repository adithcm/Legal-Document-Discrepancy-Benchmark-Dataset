In accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and all applicable Legal Requirements, Depomed shall, at its cost and expense, use reasonable best efforts to perform or cause to be performed all Product manufacture, labeling, packaging, warehousing, distribution and return, order entry, customer services and all other activities to supply and distribute the Product in the Territory in order to fill orders for Product conforming to the then-current Volume Forecast in a timely and efficient manner. From and after the completion of the sixth full calendar month following the Promotion Commencement Date, Depomed shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain at least one month's safety stock of Product (\"Safety Stock\") to address unanticipated changes in demand for the Product (calculated on the basis of the Volume Forecast contained in the then-current Annual Plan).",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Depomed 'shall' use reasonable best efforts to perform all product manufacturing and distribution activities, and 'shall' maintain a safety stock after a certain period. The modified version changes this obligation to 'may' maintain a safety stock. This creates a contradiction: While Depomed is initially obligated to ensure supply, a later clause gives them the discretion to not maintain safety stock, potentially leading to supply failures. It introduces uncertainty about the continuous availability of the product, impacting King's promotional efforts.",

The modified text changes this to King 'may' promote the product 'at its discretion'. This introduces a direct contradiction: the agreement initially requires promotion efforts, but later grants King the option to not promote the product at all. This would make it difficult to enforce the initial promotion obligations as King can simply choose not to promote.",

For purposes of the preceding sentence, King's commercially reasonable efforts shall mean, until [***], at least the same degree of effort (including with respect to the reach and frequency of Details) that King would use for the Promotion of any of King's products that are promoted in the [***], are of a similar market size and patent life, and represent a similar commercial opportunity; thereafter, King will apply the same standard, except that it may fulfill its obligations by Promoting the Product in the [***]. All statements, core selling messages and materials to be utilized by King to Promote the Product shall be consistent in all material respects with the Annual Plan and the Launch Plan. King will cause the King Sales Force and King employees and agents acting on King's behalf to comply with this Agreement and all applicable Legal Requirements in connection with the Promotion of the Product.

                "explanation": "The original text in Section 4.1(a) explicitly requires King to use 'commercially reasonable efforts' to promote the Product, specifying a measurable benchmark tied to King's promotional efforts for similar products. It also explicitly states that King is accountable for the acts/omissions of the King Sales Force. This perturbation directly contradicts these requirements by stating King's commercially reasonable efforts may be subject to internal resource allocation changes and may not reach the same degree of effort, and that King is not accountable for the acts or omissions of the King Sales Force. This weakens King's obligations and makes enforcement uncertain.",

Throughout the remainder of the Term, King shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the number of Sales Representatives comprising the King Sales Force meets or exceeds the Minimum Sales Force Level, including by promptly filling all vacant positions in the King Sales Force resulting from resignations or terminations.\n\n(b) King shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses of compensating its Sales Representatives. Consistent with applicable Legal Requirements, King shall pay incentive compensation to its Sales Representatives with respect to the Product in accordance with King's incentive compensation plan for King's own products; it being understood that, (i) through [***], King shall determine the target incentive payment for the Product in a manner consistent with the way in which King determines the target incentive payment for pharmaceutical drug products that are promoted in the [***], are of a similar market size and patent life, and represent a similar commercial opportunity; and (ii) thereafter, King shall determine the target incentive payment for the Product in a manner consistent with the way in which King determines the target incentive payment for pharmaceutical drug products promoted by King that are of a similar market size and patent life, and represent a similar commercial opportunity. King shall notify its Sales Representatives prior to the Promotion Commencement Date, or coinciding with the launch of the Product and consistent with its procedures for King's other products, of the total potential incentive compensation for the Product. Promptly after the adoption by King of an incentive compensation payment plan with respect to the Product pursuant to this Agreement and any material amendments thereto, King shall provide to Depomed [***] for the Product pursuant to such plan.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.3 Staffing; Training.\n\n(a) King is not obligated to maintain a minimum staffing level for the King Sales Force. The decision regarding the number of Sales Representatives dedicated to promoting the Product is at King's sole discretion and not subject to any minimum requirements. King's efforts to fill vacant positions will be based on internal resource prioritization and may not be prompt.\n\n(b) King retains the right to alter its compensation plans for its Sales Representatives, without any compensation for the Product being needed. It will not be needed to notify its Sales Representatives prior to the Promotion Commencement Date, or coinciding with the launch of the Product and consistent with its procedures for King's other products, of the total potential incentive compensation for the Product. Promptly after the adoption by King of an incentive compensation payment plan with respect to the Product pursuant to this Agreement and any material amendments thereto, King is not needed to provide to Depomed [***] for the Product pursuant to such plan.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text. The original stated King agreed that the Sales Force will be staffed to a 'Minimum Sales Force Level', and also describes the way King shall determine the incentive compensation for the Product. The modified text now asserts that King has no obligation to maintain minimum staffing levels and is not obligated to give compensation for the product. This introduces a clear contradiction and creates uncertainty over King's staffing and compensation commitments.",

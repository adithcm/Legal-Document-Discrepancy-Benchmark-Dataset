Either party may terminate this Agreement, or a relevant Work Order, immediately, upon the occurrence of any of the following for cause events: (a) either party's material breach of the commitments set forth in Section 3; (b) either party commences a voluntary proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or an involuntary case or proceeding is commenced against a party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law; (c) significant audit findings are identified by the other party, a Sponsor, or an applicable regulatory authority; or (d) significant operational deficiencies that are not resolved in accordance with the Steering Committee determinations following escalation. PPD shall further be permitted to terminate this Agreement or a relevant Work Order, immediately, for cause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) VS's failure to meet the agreed upon timelines, provided that such failure is due to circumstances within VS's reasonable control; (b) VS's failure to provide pricing which is reasonably competitive; (c) a change of ownership equal to fifty percent (50%) or more in the outstanding voting securities of VS; (d) the acquisition of a number of VS's outstanding voting securities by a PPD Competitor that would require disclosure by such PPD Competitor pursuant to Rule 13d-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (a \"Significant Ownership Position\"); (e) a change in any VS Key Leadership Position.",

PPD may terminate this Agreement or a relevant Work Order, immediately, for cause, in its sole discretion. The reasons for cause may include, but are not limited to: (a) VS's failure to meet the agreed upon timelines, provided that such failure is due to circumstances within VS's reasonable control; (b) VS's failure to provide pricing which is reasonably competitive; (c) a change of ownership equal to fifty percent (50%) or more in the outstanding voting securities of VS; (d) the acquisition of a number of VS's outstanding voting securities by a PPD Competitor that would require disclosure by such PPD Competitor pursuant to Rule 13d-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (a \"Significant Ownership Position\"); (e) a change in any VS Key Leadership Position.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the specific circumstances that allow PPD to terminate the agreement 'for cause.' The modification introduces uncertainty by granting PPD the discretion to terminate 'for cause' with an open ended and unclear list of examples. This contradicts the detailed list of 'for cause' events and creates ambiguity about when PPD can terminate the agreement.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices must be submitted to PPD within thirty (30) days of performing the Service or incurring the expense. PPD shall have no obligation to issue payment to VS for Services performed or expenses incurred which were not invoiced to PPD in accordance with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "VS shall submit monthly invoices to PPD detailing its activities and fees in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. PPD will use commercially reasonable efforts to process and pay invoices, but is not responsible for any delay in payment due to internal processing errors or reconciliation issues. PPD shall have no obligation to issue payment to VS for Services performed or expenses incurred which were not invoiced to PPD in accordance with this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the contract stipulated that VS had to submit invoices within 30 days of rendering services, and PPD was only obligated to pay for correctly invoiced services. The altered text removes the strict 30-day invoicing requirement, which creates uncertainty. PPD claims to use 'commercially reasonable efforts' to pay, but is not responsible for delays. The original text creates certainty while the modified text creates a contradiction.",

VS shall not refer that opportunity to any other third party provider unless PPD declines to bid on such opportunity or does not offer the service in question. During the Term, PPD acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent it is aware of an opportunity for imaging services outside of the Joint Solution, it will refer such opportunity to VS as soon as possible. Unless otherwise required by a particular Sponsor, PPD shall not refer that opportunity to any other third party provider unless VS declines to bid on such opportunity or does not offer the service in question.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, VS acknowledges and agrees that it should consider referring opportunities for clinical research services to PPD when feasible, considering its other business relationships. During the Term, PPD acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent it is aware of an opportunity for imaging services outside of the Joint Solution, it should consider VS, but is not obligated to refer the opportunity if another vendor offers a more competitive or suitable solution. Unless otherwise required by a particular Sponsor, PPD may refer that opportunity to any third party provider at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates an obligation for both parties to refer opportunities to each other before considering other providers. The changed text weakens this obligation by introducing subjective language ('should consider,' 'when feasible'), and by giving PPD the unilateral ability to use another provider based on its own discretion and business considerations. This undermines the referral commitment and creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the original mutual obligation.",

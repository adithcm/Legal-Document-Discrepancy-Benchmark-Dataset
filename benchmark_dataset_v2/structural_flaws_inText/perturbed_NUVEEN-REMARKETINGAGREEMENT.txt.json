                "explanation": "The original text states that the Remarketing Agent must give 90 days' notice to resign. By adding \"However, the Fund can waive this notice period at its sole discretion,\" a contradiction is created where the Remarketing Agent is expected to give 90 days' notice but may not have to. This creates uncertainty as to the actual required notice period. Also, the Fund shall use its best efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent, but the new text makes it optional.",

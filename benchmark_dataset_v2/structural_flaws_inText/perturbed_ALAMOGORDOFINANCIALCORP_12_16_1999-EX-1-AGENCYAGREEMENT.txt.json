                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty regarding the Agent's fees in case of termination. The original text guaranteed payment if termination wasn't due to the agent's fault. The modified version adds 'at the discretion of the Company,' contradicting the earlier guarantee and creating ambiguity regarding fee payment upon termination.",

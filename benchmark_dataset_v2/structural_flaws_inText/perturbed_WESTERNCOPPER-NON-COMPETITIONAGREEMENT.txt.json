                "original_text": "Definitions 1.1 In this Agreement, including the recitals, except as expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires, (a) Affiliate means, in respect of a party hereto, a corporation which is the subsidiary of the party or vice versa or where each of the party and the corporation is controlled by the same person, (b) Area of Non-Competition means the State of Zacatecas, Mexico and the area extending 20 kilometers in all directions from the external boundary of each mineral property owned or controlled by Western Silver or in which Western Silver holds any legal interest, in Mexico, as at the Effective Date, (c) Business Day means a day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or a civic or statutory holiday in Reno, Nevada and Vancouver, British Columbia, (d) Closing means the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement, (e) Designated Mineral Property means a mineral property or individual mineral concession within a mineral property, that is owned or controlled by Western Silver or in which Western Silver holds any legal interest in Mexico as of the Effective Date, (f) Effective Date means May 3, 200ri or such later date as determined under the Arrangement Agreement, (g) Mining Activities means any acquisition of mineral rights or any mineral exploration or development activities, in any manner whatsoever, and (h) Person means an individual, corporation, body corporate, firm, limited liability company, parmership, syndicate, joint venture, society, association, trust or unincorporated organization.",
                "changed_text": "Definitions 1.1 In this Agreement, including the recitals, except as expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires, (a) Affiliate means, in respect of a party hereto, a corporation which is the subsidiary of the party or vice versa or where each of the party and the corporation is controlled by the same person, (b) Area of Non-Competition means the State of Zacatecas, Mexico only. The area extending 20 kilometers restriction is at the sole discretion of Glamis Gold Ltd., (c) Business Day means a day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or a civic or statutory holiday in Reno, Nevada and Vancouver, British Columbia, (d) Closing means the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement, (e) Designated Mineral Property means a mineral property or individual mineral concession within a mineral property, that is owned or controlled by Western Silver or in which Western Silver holds any legal interest in Mexico as of the Effective Date, (f) Effective Date means May 3, 200ri or such later date as determined under the Arrangement Agreement, (g) Mining Activities means any acquisition of mineral rights or any mineral exploration or development activities, in any manner whatsoever, and (h) Person means an individual, corporation, body corporate, firm, limited liability company, parmership, syndicate, joint venture, society, association, trust or unincorporated organization.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Area of Non-Competition' clearly defines the geographic scope of the non-compete clause. The modified definition contradicts this by removing the automatic 20 kilometer extension and making it discretionary for Glamis. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual area Western Copper is restricted from operating in.",

                "changed_text": "Western Copper's Right of Termination 3.5 Western Copper may, at its option, terminate this Agreement by written notice to Glamis, effective immediately upon delivery of the notice. Glamis' Right of TerminaHon 3.6 Glamis may, at its option, terminate this Agreement by written notice to Western Copper, effective 90 days after delivery of the notice, regardless if Western Copper cease conducting business in the normal course, become insolvent, make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, suffer or permit the appointment of a receiver for its business or assets or avail itself of, or become subject to, any proceedings under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) or any other statute of any province or state relating to insolvency or the protection of rights of creditors.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement granted both parties the ability to terminate the agreement immediately, under certain specified conditions. This change now creates a contradiction between the terms. Western Copper can still terminate immediately while Glamis now has a 90 day waiting period that occurs regardless of the financial state of Western Copper.",

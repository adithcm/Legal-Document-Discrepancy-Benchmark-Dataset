                "original_text": "2.1 Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period of 2 years after the Effective Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, either individually or in partnership or  jointly or in conjunction with any Person, which will include being a principal, agent,  shareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever,\n\n(a) carry on or be engaged in Mining Activities, or\n\n-4-\n\n(b) advise, lend money to, guarantee the debts or obligations of or permit its name to  be used by any Person who carries on or is engaged in Mining Activities,\n\nin the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period of 2 years after the Effective Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any Person, which will include being a principal, agent, shareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever, carry on or be engaged in Mining Activities in the Area of Non-Competition. Notwithstanding the above, Western Copper may engage in Mining Activities with express written consent from Glamis, which Glamis may grant or withhold at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that Western Copper cannot engage in Mining Activities within the Area of Non-Competition, but then allows for the possibility of engaging in such activities with Glamis's permission. This creates uncertainty as to whether the non-compete is absolute or conditional.",

                "changed_text": "4.10 This Agreement may be terminated at any time by agreement in writing executed by the parties. However, in the event of a hostile takeover of either Glamis or Western Copper, the agreement may be terminated unilaterally by the entity that is not subject to the hostile takeover.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause states that termination requires written agreement from both parties. The added text allows for unilateral termination in the event of a hostile takeover, thus contradicting the need for mutual agreement. This creates uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated.",

However, if either party believes a restriction to be unduly burdensome, they may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to have the restriction modified or removed.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by stating that all restrictions are considered reasonable and valid, and all defenses to enforcement are waived. The added sentence then allows a party to challenge those same restrictions in court, thus contradicting the waiver and creating uncertainty about the enforceability of the restrictions.",

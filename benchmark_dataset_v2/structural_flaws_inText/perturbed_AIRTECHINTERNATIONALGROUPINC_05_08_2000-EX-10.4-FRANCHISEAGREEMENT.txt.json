You shall pay to AIRSOPURE an initial franchise fee of $25,000.00 upon execution of this Agreement. You agree that the initial franchise fee represents payment for the initial grant of the Franchise rights and license granted herein, shall be fully earned upon execution of this Agreement, and the said fee will not be refunded under any circumstances unless otherwise specifically set forth herein. You must find a suitable Center site within 90 days of signing the Franchise Agreement, unless we mutually agree otherwise. If we cannot agree on a Center location, within 4 months, we may a) extend your search time, b) exchange your territory, or c) terminate your Franchise and refund up to 70% of your Franchise Fee, at our sole discretion. There are no refunds under any other circumstances.",

You shall pay to AIRSOPURE an initial franchise fee of $25,000.00 upon execution of this Agreement. While this fee is generally non-refundable, specific circumstances, to be determined at AIRSOPURE's sole discretion, may warrant a partial or full refund. The franchisee will locate a suitable Center site within a timeframe determined by Airsopure, and extensions may or may not be granted. If a suitable location cannot be determined, refunds, if any, will be subject to a deduction based on administrative costs and market assessments.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the initial franchise fee will not be refunded under any circumstances unless specifically mentioned, then defines those circumstances as finding a suitable location within 4 months, in which up to 70% may be refunded at Airsopure's discretion. The modified text makes the refund more ambiguous by stating it is generally non-refundable, introducing uncertainty, and states that the timeframe will be determined by Airsopure rather than the original definite timeframe. Refunds, if any, will also be subject to a deduction of administrative costs and market assessment that further reduces the franchisee's refund.",

At the expiration of the term or any renewal term hereof, You may, at its option, renew the Franchise granted hereunder for 2 additional terms of 10 years each on the following terms and conditions:\n\n\n\n\nA. You shall give AIRSOPURE notice in writing of Your election to renew this Agreement at least 3 months prior to the expiration of the then-current term.\n\nB. You shall not be in default of any provision of this Agreement or amendment hereto, including without limitation all payment obligations to AIRSOPURE and its affiliates.\n\nC. As a condition of renewal of the Franchise, You agree to execute AIRSOPURE's then-current form of franchise agreement and to comply fully with all terms and conditions thereof, and to pay AIRSOPURE the then-current renewal fee, which is presently $1,000.00. You understand that AIRSOPURE may revise its franchise agreement for any renewal term, at AIRSOPURE's sole discretion, including without limitation to increase the royalty fees or other fees payable by You or to require other obligations of franchisees.",
                "changed_text": "2.02. At the expiration of the term or any renewal term hereof, You may or may not be allowed to renew the Franchise. Renewal eligibility will be determined based on various criteria that AIRSOPURE will determine, and may include subjective evaluations of franchisee performance and market conditions:\n\n\nA. Any request for renewal should be submitted to AIRSOPURE.\n\nB. AIRSOPURE will evaluate the Franchisee's compliance with agreement, including any history of defaults or outstanding obligations.\n\nC. The execution of AIRSOPURE's current form of franchise agreement is required. AIRSOPURE reserves the right to modify terms and conditions, including fees, at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines the clear conditions under which a franchise can be renewed. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the franchisee may or may not be allowed to renew and removes the definite terms, changing them to subjective evaluations of franchisee performance and market conditions. The original text stated a 3 month requirement for notice which is now simply a request, and the execution of AIRSOPURE's form is a requirement whether the franchisee will agree or not. The franchisee can no longer renew at their option.",

AIRSOPURE agrees to defend, indemnify and hold You harmless from all claims, losses, lawsuits and expenses arising from or relating to: (i) any claims of infringement from third Parties due to Your use of the Licensed Marks, provided that You have used the Licensed Marks as authorized by AIRSOPURE; and (ii) claims alleging that Products sold or leased by You are defective.",

AIRSOPURE may, at its discretion, defend, indemnify and hold You harmless from certain claims, losses, lawsuits and expenses arising from or relating to: (i) claims of infringement from third Parties due to Your use of the Licensed Marks, provided that You have used the Licensed Marks as authorized by AIRSOPURE; and (ii) claims alleging that Products sold or leased by You are defective. However, AIRSOPURE's obligation to indemnify is contingent upon You following the latest company procedures, and provided any claim does not arise due to intentional or reckless conduct by You.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states AIRSOPURE's obligation to indemnify the franchisee under certain circumstances. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using 'may, at its discretion', which removes any guarantee of indemnification. The change now makes the obligation contingent upon the latest company procedures and that any claim does not arise due to intentional or reckless conduct by the franchisee. This can cause conflict because the procedures can be updated at any time, and even if the franchisee makes an honest mistake, it could be considered reckless conduct, thus causing AIRSOPURE to decide against indemnifying the franchisee.",

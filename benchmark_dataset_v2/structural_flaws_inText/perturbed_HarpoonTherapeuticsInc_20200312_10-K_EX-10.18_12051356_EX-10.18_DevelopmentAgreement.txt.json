                "explanation": "By removing the 'not' from clauses (a) through (f), the definition of 'Indication' is fundamentally changed. The original text explicitly excludes subtypes, symptom domains, combination therapies, etc., from being considered additional indications. The modified text now includes all of these as additional indications, directly contradicting the original intent and broadening the scope of what constitutes a new Indication. This has implications for milestone payments and other financial obligations that are tied to the approval of new Indications. The contradiction creates uncertainty as to how future milestones will be determined and paid.",

The foregoing license under the AbbVie Reversion IP shall be payable on a country-by-country basis and [***] (applied mutatis mutandis to Harpoon) by Harpoon, its Affiliates or sublicensees of Harpoon Reversion Products, beginning [***].",

Following the License Option Exercise Closing Date, if this Agreement terminates in its entirety, regardless of the reason for termination, the following shall apply with respect to Harpoon Reversion Products.\n\n12.7.1 At Harpoon's sole election by written notice to AbbVie, AbbVie shall grant, and hereby grants to Harpoon, [***] (the \"AbbVie Reversion IP\"); provided that the foregoing license shall exclude (1) any license or other rights with respect to any active ingredient and (2) any license or other rights with respect to any other Patents or Know-How owned or controlled by AbbVie or any of its Affiliates.

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the reversion of Harpoon Products applies only when the termination is not due to AbbVie's termination for Harpoon's material breach or insolvency (Section 12.2.1 or 12.4). This protects AbbVie's interests in situations where Harpoon has significantly failed in its obligations. The modified text removes this exception, making the reversion clause applicable regardless of the reason for termination. Further more, `that is not a Licensed Compound` is also removed making it broad. This directly contradicts the original intention and introduces uncertainty in scenarios where Harpoon's actions led to the termination, as it's no longer clear if the reversion clause applies in these cases. The impact on IP is expanded with active ingridient.",

                "explanation": "The change introduces in-text contradiction in terms of commencialy reasonable efforts. The modified text places the entire description of 'Specific Responsibilities' of the JGC into the definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts'. This creates direct contradictions. One section defining \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" as `[***]` while another defines it as something with JGC responsabilities. This makes it uncertain which activity has priority. It causes ambiguity in performance standards by linking strategic and collaborative functions (JGC activities) directly to the standard of effort required.",

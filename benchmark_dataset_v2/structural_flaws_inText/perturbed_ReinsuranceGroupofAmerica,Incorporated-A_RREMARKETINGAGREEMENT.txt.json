(a) If there has been a successful Remarketing, the Company shall pay to the Remarketing Agent for the  performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder on the Remarketing Settlement Date, by wire transfer to an account designated by the  Remarketing Agent, a fee in an amount equal to 25 basis points (0.25%) of the Accreted Value of the Remarketed Securities.\n\n(b) The Company agrees to pay:\n\n(i) the costs incident to the preparation and printing of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto;\n\n(ii) the costs of distributing the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto;\n\n(iii) the fees and expenses of qualifying the Remarketing Securities under the securities laws of the several jurisdictions as provided in  Section 5(b) and of preparing and distributing a Blue Sky Memorandum (including related fees and expenses of counsel to the Remarketing  Agent); and\n\n(iv) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Issuers hereunder.\n\nThe Trust shall not be liable for any fees and expenses in this Section.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'at the Company's discretion, up to' in Section 4(a), the obligation to pay is now discretionary, creating uncertainty. Replacing 'agrees to pay' with 'may agree to pay' in Section 4(b), introduces further uncertainty about which expenses the Company must cover. By changing the last sentence to 'The Trust may be liable for fees and expenses in this Section', it contradicts the first paragraph.",

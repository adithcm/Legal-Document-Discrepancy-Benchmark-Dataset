                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Company *shall* pay a fee equal to 25 basis points of the Accreted Value. The modified text makes the payment discretionary, introducing the phrase *'the Company may, at its sole discretion'* and changing the fee amount to *'may or may not be equal to'* creating uncertainty.",

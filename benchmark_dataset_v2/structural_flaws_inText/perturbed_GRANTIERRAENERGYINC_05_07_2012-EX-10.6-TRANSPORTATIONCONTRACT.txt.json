                "changed_text": "CLAUSE FIFTH  FEES    5.1 The Contract may be agreed under either the \"Spot\" or \"Ship or Pay\" modality, subject to negotiation between ECOPETROL and the SENDER. Payment terms, including fees for barrels not effectively transported, will be determined on a case-by-case basis.    5.2 While the SENDER typically pays a fee, ECOPETROL reserves the right to waive or adjust fees at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "Clause 5.2 originally stated that the SENDER is **obligated irrevocably and unconditionally** to pay the fee. The changed text introduces uncertainty by stating that ECOPETROL may **waive or adjust fees at its sole discretion**. This directly contradicts the original text, making it unclear when and how the SENDER is required to pay.",

                "explanation": "The original Clause Tenth makes the SENDER **obliged particularly** to specific requirements.

If this is not possible, the penal pecuniary clause shall be collected by means of execution for  which the Contract shall be a writ of execution.    12.3 The application of the penal pecuniary clause does not include the indemnification for any damages borne by the SENDER if the amounts of  these are higher, under the criteria of ECOPETROL, to the amount of the penal pecuniary clause agreed hereof, nor it releases the SENDER from its  payment obligation of the totality of the value of the Contract pursuant to the conditions agreed.",

ECOPETROL's decision on how to address the breach is final.    12.3 The application of the penalty, or lack thereof, does not affect ECOPETROL's right to seek full indemnification for all damages incurred.",
                "explanation": "The original Clause 12 mandates that SENDER pay ECOPETROL a penalty of 10%. The changed text now uses \"may\" and states that penalties are 'subject to ECOPETROL's sole discretion', contradicting that it must be paid in each case. Furthermore, It removes the certainty that the penalty will be taken from balance or bond, and making it *subject to ECOPETROL's sole discretion.*",

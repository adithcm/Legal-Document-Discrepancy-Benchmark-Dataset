However, drkoop.com may, at its sole discretion, waive this requirement and accept Sponsor Advertising Content artwork with less than five business days' notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Sponsor to provide artwork at least five days in advance. The added sentence gives drkoop.com the discretion to waive this requirement, creating uncertainty about whether the Sponsor is actually obligated to adhere to the five-day notice period.",

The added sentence allows drkoop.com to immediately terminate for a material breach of Article 6, contradicting the initial 30-day cure period and creating uncertainty about the actual termination process.",

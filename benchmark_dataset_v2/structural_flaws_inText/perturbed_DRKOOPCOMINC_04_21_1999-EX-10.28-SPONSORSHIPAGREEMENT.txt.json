                "original_text": "Throughout the Term (as defined below), Sponsor shall be the * * * vitamin and supplement sponsor of, and the * * * vitamin and supplement advertiser on, the drkoop.com Website * * *",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the Term (as defined below), Sponsor may be a vitamin and supplement sponsor of, and a vitamin and supplement advertiser on, the drkoop.com Website subject to drkoop.com's discretion and potential agreements with other sponsors.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Sponsor 'shall be' the exclusive vitamin sponsor, implying a guaranteed exclusivity. The modified version replaces 'shall be' with 'may be' and adds a clause indicating it is 'subject to drkoop.com's discretion and potential agreements with other sponsors'. This directly contradicts the initial exclusivity, creating uncertainty about the Sponsor's actual rights.",

In the event that an Individual User grants rights to Sponsor for use of his User Data, Sponsor shall use its best efforts to keep User Data confidential and shall only use such data in an ethical manner. Sponsor may use User Data for its owns purposes, but User Data may not be disclosed, sold, assigned, leased or otherwise disposed of to third parties by Sponsor.",
                "changed_text": "Drkoop.com may provide User Data to Sponsor at its sole discretion, based on user authorization and internal data sharing policies. While Sponsor should strive to keep User Data confidential and ethical, drkoop.com is not responsible for how User Data is ultimately handled. Sponsor may use User Data for marketing or internal research. Sponsor shall be allowed to share anonymous, aggregated User Data with third parties.",
                "explanation": "The original section stipulates 'Drkoop.com shall provide' user data with authorization. The edited clause instead provides that 'Drkoop.com may provide User Data to Sponsor at its sole discretion.' Also the original section explicitly says 'User Data may not be disclosed, sold, assigned, leased or otherwise disposed of to third parties by Sponsor.' The new clause says 'Sponsor shall be allowed to share anonymous, aggregated User Data with third parties.' This directly conflicts with the non-disclosure clause. Both these create uncertainty about the Sponsor's rights and obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Each party may attempt to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' written notice of a potential breach by the other party; however, drkoop.com reserves the sole right to determine if a breach has actually occurred, and the termination shall only be effective if drkoop.com acknowledges the breach. The breaching party will then have thirty (30) days to cure the breach if drkoop.com deems it curable. If drkoop.com does not acknowledge such breach, this agreement will continue.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows either party to terminate for a breach, given a 30-day notice and failure to cure. The modified version adds that 'drkoop.com reserves the sole right to determine if a breach has actually occurred'. It makes termination dependent on drkoop.com's acknowledgement, removing Sponsor's power to terminate independently. This creates uncertainty and favors drkoop.com.",

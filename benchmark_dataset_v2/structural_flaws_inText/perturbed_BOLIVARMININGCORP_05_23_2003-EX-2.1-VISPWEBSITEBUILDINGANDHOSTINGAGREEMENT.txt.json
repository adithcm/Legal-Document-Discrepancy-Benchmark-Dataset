This agreement shall renew automatically each year thereafter, unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of this agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic renewal unless a party gives notice. The modified text requires mutual written agreement for each renewal, thereby contradicting the automatic renewal provision and creating uncertainty about the renewal process.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that KCI's customers receive certain services for no charge. The modified text introduces the possibility of additional charges for those same services, contradicting the 'no charge' statement and making it unclear what services are actually free.",

For purposes of this definition,          the term \"control\" as applied to any Person, means the possession,          directly or indirectly, of at least fifty-one per cent (51%) of the          power to direct or cause the direction of the management of that          Person, whether&sbsp;through ownership of voting securities or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.3      \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any Person, any Person which,          directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common          control with, the specified Person. For purposes of this definition,          the term \"control\" as applied to any Person, means the possession,          directly or indirectly, of at least twenty per cent (20%) of the          power to direct or cause the direction of the management of that          Person, whether&sbsp;through ownership of voting securities or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Affiliate\" is modified by changing the control percentage from 51% to 20%. This creates an internal contradiction because other sections of the agreement might rely on the original 51% definition, especially concerning liability and obligations. This uncertainty could cause disputes.",

                "explanation": "The duration of the confidentiality agreement is changed from 10 years to 1 year. Additionally, the right of LEO to use confidential information post-termination is removed. This creates uncertainty around the protection of confidential information and contradicts the initial intent of Article V to safeguard proprietary information. This also might contradict with the article 7.4 regarding the transfer of data.",

                "explanation": "The changed text directly contradicts the original text regarding the assignability of the agreement. The new version states that the agreement is not binding upon successors and is freely assignable without consent, which creates direct conflicts with the previous restriction. Moreover, it states that GALEN may NOT perform any of its obligations through its U.S. Affiliates, Warner Chilcott, Inc., in stark contradiction with the original text.",

                "explanation": "The original definition explicitly excludes contractual rights. The modified definition introduces an exception, stating that contractual rights can be included if both parties agree in writing. This contradicts the original definition and creates uncertainty regarding the scope of Intellectual Property Rights, potentially leading to disputes about whether specific contractual rights are covered.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable (subject to Section 3.01(g)) license under the Nuance Patents, solely to the extent that claims of the Nuance Patents cover products or services of the SpinCo Business in the SpinCo Field of Use, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit such products and services, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the license is 'fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable'. The modified text removes 'fully paid-up' and introduces uncertainty by stating 'The duration and transferability of this license will be determined on a yearly basis and is subject to renegotiation.' This directly contradicts the original clause and undermines the certainty of the license granted, creating uncertainty about its long-term validity.",

Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. However, in situations deemed necessary by the assigning party, assignments can be made without consent, provided the assigning party notifies the other party within 30 days of the assignment.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits assignment without prior written consent. The modified text introduces a loophole, allowing assignments without consent if the assigning party deems it necessary, as long as they provide notification within 30 days. This directly contradicts the initial prohibition and makes the requirement for consent uncertain, leading to potential disputes about the validity of assignments made without consent.",

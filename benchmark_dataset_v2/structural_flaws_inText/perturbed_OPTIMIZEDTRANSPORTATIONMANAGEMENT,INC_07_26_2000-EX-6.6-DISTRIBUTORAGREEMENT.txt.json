Equipment      purchased from ITS, which becomes defective within that time period will be      repaired by ITS at its  headquarters  in San  Antonio,  Texas at no cost to      COMWARE  beyond cost of shipping  the  equipment  to ITS. ITS will bear the      cost of returning the item to COMWARE by UPS,  REGULAR  DELIVERY.  priority      shipping costs will be borne by COMWARE.\n\n     This  warranty  is  contingent  upon  proper  use and  installation  of the      Products and does not cover equipment which has been modified  without ITS'      consent or which has been  subjected  to  unusual  physical  or  electrical      stress or on which the original  identification  marks have been removed or      altered.",

The modified version removes the explicit timeframe, and now states repairs will be addressed at the discretion of ITS. The original also stated that modifications of the product without ITS' consent would void the warranty, while the new version removes that clause potentially opening ITS up to warranty claims for products modified without their consent.",

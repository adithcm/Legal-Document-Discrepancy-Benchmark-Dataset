                "original_text": "The White Hat Parties shall appear in person or by proxy for quorum purposes at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, to vote all of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties on the record date (if the 2020 Annual Meeting is within thirty (30) days of the anniversary of the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, such number of shares shall be no less than 90% of the Current Position) for such meeting (i) in favor of all persons nominated by the Board to serve as directors of the Company and against any stockholder nominated candidate not endorsed by the Board, (ii) against the stockholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act as disclosed to the White Hat Parties prior to the execution of this Agreement, (iii) to ratify the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and (iv) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal and new equity compensation plan (collectively, the \"2020 Proposals\"), provided, that with respect to the proposals described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of this Section 4, the White Hat Parties may vote in accordance with the recommendation of Institutional Shareholders Services to the extent such recommendation differs from the voting commitments set forth herein and provided that the White Hat Parties do not publicly disclose their vote on such proposals if it differs from the Board's recommendation; and provided, further, that White Hat Parties shall have the right to vote the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties in their sole discretion with respect to all other proposals brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "changed_text": "The White Hat Parties shall appear in person or by proxy for quorum purposes at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, to vote at least 50% of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties on the record date. The White Hat Parties shall have the right to vote the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties in their sole discretion with respect to all proposals brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original text by removing the specific voting commitments outlined in clauses (i) through (iv). Originally, the White Hat Parties were obligated to vote in favor of the Board's nominees and against specific proposals. The modified text grants them sole discretion over all proposals, effectively nullifying their prior commitments. This creates uncertainty regarding their voting obligations, potentially undermining the purpose of the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be freely assigned by either party to any affiliate or subsidiary without the need for prior written consent. However, assignment to any other entity requires prior written consent.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the original clause. The original states that *any* assignment requires prior written consent from the other party. The revised clause allows assignment to affiliates or subsidiaries *without* consent, creating a clear contradiction and potential disputes over what constitutes a permissible assignment.",

                "original_text": "Unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement, upon the expiration of the Support Period in accordance with Section 4, this Agreement shall immediately and automatically terminate in its entirety and no Party shall have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, no Party shall be released from any breach of this Agreement that occurred prior to the termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement, upon the expiration of the Support Period in accordance with Section 4, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for an additional year, unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the initial Support Period. No Party shall be released from any breach of this Agreement that occurred prior to the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states it terminates automatically upon the expiration of the Support Period. This modified text states that instead of automatic termination, the agreement *continues* for another year unless notice is given. This is a direct contradiction, creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration and obligations beyond the initial Support Period.",

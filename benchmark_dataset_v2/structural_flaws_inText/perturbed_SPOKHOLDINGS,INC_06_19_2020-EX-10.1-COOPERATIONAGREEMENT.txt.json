The White Hat Parties shall appear in person or by proxy for quorum purposes at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, to vote all of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties on the record date (if the 2020 Annual Meeting is within thirty (30) days of the anniversary of the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, such number of shares shall be no less than 90% of the Current Position) for such meeting (i) in favor of all persons nominated by the Board to serve as directors of the Company and against any stockholder nominated candidate not endorsed by the Board, (ii) against the stockholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act as disclosed to the White Hat Parties prior to the execution of this Agreement, (iii) to ratify the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and (iv) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal and new equity compensation plan (collectively, the \"2020 Proposals\"), provided, that with respect to the proposals described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of this Section 4, the White Hat Parties may vote in accordance with the recommendation of Institutional Shareholders Services to the extent such recommendation differs from the voting commitments set forth herein and provided that the White Hat Parties do not publicly disclose their vote on such proposals if it differs from the Board's recommendation; and provided, further, that White Hat Parties shall have the right to vote the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties in their sole discretion with respect to all other proposals brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting. The White Hat Parties shall provide written evidence of the votes made in accordance with the foregoing sentence to the Company no later than ten business days before the 2020 Annual Meeting.",

The White Hat Parties shall appear in person or by proxy for quorum purposes at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, to vote a portion of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties on the record date (if the 2020 Annual Meeting is within thirty (30) days of the anniversary of the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, such number of shares shall be no less than 90% of the Current Position) for such meeting (i) in favor of all persons nominated by the Board to serve as directors of the Company and against any stockholder nominated candidate not endorsed by the Board, (ii) against the stockholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act as disclosed to the White Hat Parties prior to the execution of this Agreement, (iii) to ratify the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and (iv) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal and new equity compensation plan (collectively, the \"2020 Proposals\"), provided, that with respect to the proposals described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of this Section 4, the White Hat Parties may vote in accordance with the recommendation of Institutional Shareholders Services to the extent such recommendation differs from the voting commitments set forth herein and provided that the White Hat Parties do not publicly disclose their vote on such proposals if it differs from the Board's recommendation; and provided, further, that White Hat Parties shall have the right to vote the remaining shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties in their sole discretion with respect to all other proposals brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting. The White Hat Parties are not obligated to provide written evidence of the votes made in accordance with the foregoing sentence to the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that White Hat Parties will vote *all* of their shares in favor of the Board's nominees and against non-endorsed candidates. The modification changes 'all' to 'a portion', and adds that remaining shares can be voted at White Hat's discretion for other proposals, contradicting the initial commitment for *all* shares on specific matters. Furthermore, it removes the requirement to provide written evidence of votes, creating uncertainty about accountability and enforcement of the voting commitment.",

Unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement, upon the expiration of the Support Period in accordance with Section 4, this Agreement shall immediately and automatically terminate in its entirety and no Party shall have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, no Party shall be released from any breach of this Agreement that occurred prior to the termination of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that the agreement shall immediately and automatically terminate upon expiration of the Support Period. By changing it to 'may terminate at either party's discretion', it contradicts the automatic nature of the termination, creating uncertainty about the agreement's lifespan and each party's rights and obligations beyond the initial Support Period. One implies termination is assured; the other implies it is optional.",

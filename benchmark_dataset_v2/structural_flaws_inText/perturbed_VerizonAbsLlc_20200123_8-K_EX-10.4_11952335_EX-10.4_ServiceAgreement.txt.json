The Servicer will manage, service, administer and collect on the Receivables with reasonable care using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises for all comparable device payment plan agreement receivables that it services for itself or others according to the Servicing Procedures. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer's obligations will include:\n\n(i) collecting and applying all payments made on, or credits applied to, the Receivables and any other amounts received related to the Depositor Transferred Property;\n\n(ii) investigating delinquencies;\n\n(iii) sending invoices and notices and responding to inquiries of Obligors;\n\n(iv) processing requests for extensions, modifications and adjustments;\n\n(v) administering payoffs, prepayments, defaults and delinquencies;\n\n(vi) maintaining accurate and complete accounts and receivables systems for servicing the Receivables;\n\n(vii) providing to the Custodian copies, or access to, any documents that modify or supplement information in the Receivable Files; and\n\n(viii) preparing and providing Monthly Investor Reports and any other periodic reports required to be prepared by the Servicer under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates \"reasonable care\" and a specific \"degree of skill and attention,\" while the revised text gives the Servicer discretion and removes any specific standard of care. It replaced will with may. Replacing the phrase, this creates uncertainty in the Servicer's obligations. Instead of exercising 'skill' it has 'discretion' on doing so.",

The Servicer will not resign as Servicer under this Agreement unless it determines it is legally unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Servicer will notify the Issuer, the Parent Support Provider, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee of its resignation as soon as practicable after it determines it is required to resign, together with an Opinion of Counsel supporting its determination. The Issuer will promptly notify the Rating Agencies of any resignation of the Servicer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document, immediately upon the resignation of Cellco as Servicer pursuant to this Section 7.1, Cellco, in its individual capacity, will be required to assume the obligations of the Servicer to acquire Receivables as set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.7 of the Master Trust Receivables Transfer Agreement and Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of this Agreement without further action.",

Notice of the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, the determination of a Benchmark Replacement and the making of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will be delivered in writing by the Administrator to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, a Responsible Person of the Indenture Trustee, the Parent Support Provider, the Sponsor, the Depositor and the Servicer and included in the Monthly Investor Report. Notwithstanding anything in the Transaction Documents to the contrary, upon the delivery of notice to a Responsible Person of the Indenture Trustee and the inclusion of such information in the Monthly Investor Report, the relevant Transaction Documents will be deemed to have been amended to reflect the new Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement, Benchmark Replacement Adjustment and/or Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes without further compliance with the amendment provisions of the relevant Transaction Documents.",

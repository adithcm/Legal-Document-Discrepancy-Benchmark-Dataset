In the event of any conflict, inconsistency or ambiguity between two or more provisions in this Agreement, including the provisions in its Exhibits and Purchase Schedules, the provisions in the documents will govern, supersede and control over one another in the following order of priority: (1st) a Purchase Schedule with regards to the purchase and sale of the specific products identified in that Purchase Schedule for its duration; (2nd) the SOP; (3rd) any Exhibit to this Agreement but only with regards to specific subject matter of the Exhibit; and (4t h) the main body of this Agreement prior to the signature page.",

                "explanation": "This change reverses the priority of interpretation, placing the main body of the agreement *above* Purchase Schedules.  This means that a general term in the main agreement could override a specific term negotiated within a Purchase Schedule, undermining the purpose of the schedules and creating uncertainty. If a Purchase Schedule specifies a price, but the main body of the contract has a conflicting clause on pricing adjustments, it's now unclear which clause prevails.",

The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Section with regards to disclosed Confidential Information will continue: (1) Until the earlier of (i) sixty (60) months from the date of disclosure to a Receiving Party or (ii) the date such information ceases to be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement, for Confidential Information that is not a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law; and (2) Until Confidential Information that is a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law ceases to be a trade secret of the Disclosing Party under Applicable Law.",

The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Section with regards to disclosed Confidential Information will continue: (1) Until the earlier of (i) twelve (12) months from the date of disclosure to a Receiving Party or (ii) the date such information ceases to be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement, for Confidential Information that is not a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law; and (2) Indefinitely, even if Confidential Information that is a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law ceases to be a trade secret of the Disclosing Party under Applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly reduces the confidentiality period for non-trade secrets to 12 months, while simultaneously stating that trade secrets remain confidential *indefinitely*, even if they cease to be trade secrets.  This creates a contradiction: if a trade secret loses its trade secret status, but the agreement still considers it confidential, it's unclear what obligations the receiving party has, especially given the original clause (1) that defined a duration until 'the date such information ceases to be considered Confidential Information'. Enforcement becomes ambiguous.",

This Agreement, its rights and obligations, is not assignable or transferable by either Party, in whole or in part, except with the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

The assigning Party will provide the other Party with written notice of such assignment prior to or promptly following the effective date of such assignment. A change of control shall be deemed an assignment requiring consent hereunder provided that any transfer or assignment that results in Seller's and Buyer's current common parent, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited, ceasing to control either party shall not require consent of the other party. The restrictions in this Section will not preclude a Party for authorizing an Affiliate to purchase or sell a product on behalf of a Party under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assignees of the respective Parties.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes 'without' to 'with' in the second sentence. This section initially says that the contract cannot be assigned without prior written consent of the other party. After the modification, it says that the contract cannot be assigned to any affiliates unless with the prior written consent of the other party. Since the sentence before already stated assignment requires consent, stating it again leads to an ambiguity. Which of the assignment requires written consent? All assignments or assignments related to affiliates, mergers, etc? This will cause uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text stated that the agreement term concludes on a specific date unless renewed by agreement. The changed text introduces an automatic renewal, contradicting the 'unless renewed by agreement' clause and creating uncertainty about how renewal occurs.",

However, Torvec reserves the right to continue the agreement despite these conditions at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly outlines conditions under which the agreement can be immediately terminated. The added sentence gives Torvec the right to override these termination conditions, creating a contradiction and uncertainty. This undermines the enforceability of the termination clause.",

                "explanation": "The original text stated that neither party can assign rights without consent. The changed text says that Torvec can assign its rights at any time, which contradicts the first sentence. The condition to Torvec creates confusion and gives one party unfair leverage.",

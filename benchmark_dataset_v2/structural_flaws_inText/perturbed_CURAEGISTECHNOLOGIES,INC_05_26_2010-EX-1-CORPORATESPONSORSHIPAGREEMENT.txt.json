                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") shall commence on the Effective Date and conclude on October 31, 2010. The agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the renewal date.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines a fixed term ending on October 31, 2010, with renewal requiring explicit agreement. The modified clause introduces an automatic renewal, contradicting the initial fixed term and the need for mutual agreement, thus creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Torvec shall have the right to terminate this agreement for any reason or no reason with thirty (30) days written notice.",

The added sentence grants Torvec the right to terminate for *any* reason with 30 days' notice, contradicting the specific conditions previously outlined. This introduces ambiguity: can Torvec *only* terminate for the reasons listed *or* for *any* reason?",

The added sentence allows Vendor to initiate legal proceedings in Pennsylvania, directly contradicting the exclusivity of the New York venue. This creates uncertainty about where disputes will be resolved.",

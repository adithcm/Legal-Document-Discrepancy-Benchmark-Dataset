                "original_text": "Schoolpop agrees that it will sell Cards only to Clients and only for use in connection with a bona fide fund raising program. Schoolpop will not knowingly sell Cards to any Client who does not meet any AEIS qualification standard(s) or to any Client or potential Client that Schoolpop has reason to believe would be unsatisfactory to AEIS.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop agrees that it *may* sell Cards to Clients regardless of their intended use. Schoolpop *may*, at its discretion, sell Cards to Clients who do not meet AEIS qualification standards or to any Client or potential Client, even if Schoolpop has reason to believe they would be unsatisfactory to AEIS.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Schoolpop sell cards *only* to clients for fundraising and prohibits sales to unqualified or unsatisfactory clients. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating Schoolpop *may* sell cards regardless of these conditions, directly contradicting the original obligation and creating uncertainty about Schoolpop's responsibilities.",

Should Schoolpop or its Client distribute Cards without such Cardholder agreement, Schoolpop shall indemnify and hold harmless AEIS, its parents, subsidiaries and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, against any and all Loss, hereinafter defined, that AEIS may incur or be subjected to as a result of such action, including, without limitation, any claims brought by any entity including but not limited to governmental entities and Cardholders.",

AEIS will hold Schoolpop harmless from any Losses arising from instances of Schoolpop failing to provide clients with the Cardholder Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Schoolpop to distribute the cardholder agreement and holds them liable for losses if they fail to do so. The modified text states Schoolpop is not required to distribute these agreements and further protects Schoolpop in instances where Cardholder Agreements are not supplied, completely negating the original requirements and liability and creating direct conflict on the obligations and liabilities of Schoolpop.",

                "explanation": "In the original text, AEIS takes responsibility for cards lost in transit initially. Schoolpop assumes responsibility on delivery.

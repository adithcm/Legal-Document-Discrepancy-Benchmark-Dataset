                "explanation": "The original text states that the Distributor *must* receive permission to sell products at any price other than those set by the Developer. The modified text allows the Distributor to offer promotional pricing or discounts *without* prior approval, directly contradicting the original requirement and creating uncertainty about pricing control.",

Developer may cancel this Agreement if the total gross annual software revenue does not meet DeVeloper's revenue forecast for the Distributor, such cancellation to be eftected by written notice delivered to Distributor not later than 30 days after any Developer's Fiscal Year end (June 30). Either party may cancel this Agreement effective on the last day of the Initial Term, or any Renewal Term, by serving written notice of such termination on the other party at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term as the case may be.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines a process in which the agreement will auto-renew under specific cancellation circumstances that requires 90 days notice, where the modified text allows immediate cancellation, directly contradicting the initial auto-renewal/notice requirements.

Developer's right to audit Distributor's books and records is contingent upon Developer obtaining explicit permission from End-Users to do so.",
                "explanation": "Originally, Developer could audit Distributor's records upon 'reasonable notice'. The revision requires the Developer to obtain permission from 'End-Users' (who aren't party to the agreement) before an audit. This contradicts Developer's right to access records and audit payments, making enforcement very difficult.  It's unlikely the end-users would cooperate, effectively nullifying the audit clause.",

If, but only if HOC exercises the Option and completes the acquisition of the Additional Shares, HOC shall be entitled to nominate one (1) individual to the Board of Directors (the \"HOC Director\"). Upon receipt of such nomination and its satisfaction that the individual nominated by HOC meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable laws, the Board of Directors further agrees to expand its membership to four (4) positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly-created vacancy. The Board of Directors further agrees that if HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 14.5%, it shall nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Appointment of HOC Nominee. If, but only if HOC exercises the Option and completes the acquisition of the Additional Shares, HOC may nominate one (1) individual to the Board of Directors (the \"HOC Director\"). Upon receipt of such nomination and its satisfaction that the individual nominated by HOC meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable laws, the Board of Directors will consider expanding its membership to four (4) positions and may appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly-created vacancy. The Board of Directors may agree that if HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 14.5%, it can nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly stated that **HOC *shall* be entitled to nominate** a director if they exercise the option. It also states that the **Board *agrees* to expand its membership** and appoint the nominee. The modified version weakens these obligations by replacing \"shall\" and \"agrees\" with \"may\" and \"will consider\", respectively. This creates uncertainty about whether HOC's nominee will actually be appointed, even if HOC meets all the specified conditions. This introduces an in-text contradiction by implying in the first sentence of the original text that HOC should nominate a director, but also imply in the following sentences of the changed text that they may or may not appoint them after nomination.",

Furthermore, any HOC Director nominated and appointed pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.1 or 5.2 shall immediately resign in the event that the provisions of subsection (i) or (ii) above shall be applicable.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states the benefits *shall* immediately terminate if HOC's pro rata interest falls below 14.5% or if it disposes of 20% or more of its interest. Additionally, any HOC director *shall* immediately resign if these events occur. The modified clause changes \"shall\" to \"may\", introducing ambiguity. This means the termination of benefits and the director's resignation are no longer guaranteed and are now subject to interpretation and potential dispute. Furthermore, it adds \"subject to Board approval\", implying that the board has the authority to allow the director to remain, regardless of HOC's pro rata interest, which is an in-text contradiction, and the termination of benefits can be waived by the board.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement *may not* be assigned without prior written consent. The modified text directly contradicts this by saying the agreement *may* be assigned at either party's discretion, and then encourages written consent, but it is not required. This completely undermines the original clause, creating uncertainty about whether the agreement is freely assignable or requires consent, thus leading to an in-text contradiction.",

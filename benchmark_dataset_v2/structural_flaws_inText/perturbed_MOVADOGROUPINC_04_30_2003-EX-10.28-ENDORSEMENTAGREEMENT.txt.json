Surrender, Withdrawals, Loans; Etc. Other than as specifically allowed herein, the Company shall not borrow from, hypothecate, withdraw cash value from, surrender in whole or in part, cancel, or in any other manner encumber the Policy without the prior written consent of the Trustees of the Trust. Unless the Company and the Trustees of the Trust otherwise agree, in the event there is a complete or partial surrender or cancellation of the Policy, the proceeds payable as a result of the surrender, cancellation, withdrawal or loan shall be paid to the Company in an amount equal to the aggregate premiums paid under the Policy since inception, and any remaining proceeds shall be payable to the Trust.",
                "changed_text": "2. Ownership of Policy. The Company shall be the owner of the Policy, subject to the conditions outlined elsewhere in this agreement.\n\n3. Surrender, Withdrawals, Loans; Etc. The Company may borrow from, hypothecate, withdraw cash value from, surrender in whole or in part, cancel, or in any other manner encumber the Policy at its discretion. However, the Trustees of the Trust retain the right to approve or deny the Company's actions, and their decision will be final. In the event there is a complete or partial surrender or cancellation of the Policy, the proceeds shall be divided as determined by the Company, with consideration given to the aggregate premiums paid since inception and any remaining proceeds payable to the Trust, subject to the Trustees' oversight.",
                "explanation": "Section 2 originally stated the company as 'sole and exclusive owner' of the policy. Section 3 restricted the company's ability to make changes to the policy without the trustee's permission. The modified version grants the Company more discretion over the policy in Section 3 while introducing ambiguity by making it subject to the Trustees' oversight, creating a contradiction with the company's ownership rights. It is now unclear to what extent the Company can control the policy without interference. The Trustees approving or denying the company's actions gives them a final decision, directly conflicting with the company's rights to ownership.",

The Company may amend or modify this Agreement at any time, but any such amendment or modification that would adversely affect the rights of the Trust under this Agreement shall not be effective without the prior written consent of the Trustees of the Trust.\n\n15.

The rights of the Trust under this agreement shall terminate immediately upon any change of control of the Company.",
                "explanation": "Section 10 originally stated that any amendment affecting the rights of the trust required the trustee's consent. Section 15 stated that the agreement binds the trust and its successors. The modified version gives the company the right to unilaterally change the agreement without the trust's consent, directly contradicting the earlier restriction. Additionally, stating that the Trust's rights terminate upon a change of control of the company directly conflicts with the intention of Section 15, creating a contradiction regarding the continuity of the agreement for the Trust.",

                "original_text": "5. Payment of Premiums. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay premiums on the Policy as provided under the Policy. In the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with terms of Section 11, the Company shall not be liable for any premiums owed on the Policy after the date of termination.\n\n11. Termination. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall terminate upon the Trust's payment to the Company of the sum of the aggregate amount of the premiums paid under the Policy since inception (which amount includes the outstanding principal balance of the Demand Note). In the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with this Section 11, the Company shall transfer the Policy to the Trust as soon as is administratively practicable. Payment of the foregoing amounts by the Trust to the Company will be full repayment of the Demand Note.",
                "changed_text": "5. Payment of Premiums. The Company agrees to pay premiums on the Policy, although it reserves the right to cease premium payments at any time without notice. In the event this Agreement is terminated, the Company's responsibility for premiums will be determined at its sole discretion.\n\n11. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by either the Company or the Trust, with the specific conditions for termination determined by the Company at the time of termination. Upon termination, the transfer of the Policy back to the Trust is not guaranteed and shall be at the Company's sole discretion. Payment of any amounts by the Trust shall be considered a partial repayment of debt and will not necessarily lead to full repayment of the Demand Note.",
                "explanation": "Section 5 originally stated that the company agrees to pay premiums, but then stated that after termination, they are not liable. Section 11 originally stated that the agreement terminates when the trust pays the amount and the policy would be transferred back. The changed text introduces contradictions to both sections. By granting the Company the right to cease payments or change termination conditions, it contradicts the company's original agreement to pay. Additionally, reversing whether the Trust gets the policy back and whether their payment is full contradicts the original agreement.",

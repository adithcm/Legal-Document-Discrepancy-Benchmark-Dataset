The modified text states that such amendments are effective immediately upon notice, removing the requirement for consent and contradicting the original intent. This creates uncertainty about the Trust's rights and the Company's ability to unilaterally alter the agreement to the Trust's detriment.",

In the event of a \"Company Default\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Default by notifying the Company in writing within sixty (60) days after its receipt of notice of a Company Default, or if later, within thirty (30) days after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Default. If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within sixty (60) days after the Company Default occurs. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall immediately transfer ownership of the Policy to the Trust and the Company shall thereafter have no rights with respect to the Policy. The Trust's failure to exercise its rights under this Section 7 shall not be deemed to release the Company from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not preclude the Trust from seeking other remedies with respect to the Company Default. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"Company Default\" shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to the Policy if the Company fails to pay a premium on the Policy as required under the terms of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after the due date for such premium, or if the Company processes or attempts to process a policy loan, or a complete or partial surrender, or a cash value withdrawal without prior written approval from the Trustees of the Trust. The Company shall notify the Trustees of the Trust within five (5) business days of any event which constitutes a Company Default.",

If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust may, at the Company's sole discretion, require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within sixty (60) days after the Company Default occurs, but the Company retains the final decision on whether to transfer ownership. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall evaluate and decide whether to transfer ownership of the Policy to the Trust; the Company retains full rights with respect to the Policy. The Trust's failure to exercise its rights under this Section 7 shall be deemed to release the Company from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and shall preclude the Trust from seeking other remedies with respect to the Company Default.

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Trust has the *right to require* the Company to transfer the policy upon uncured default, which is a strong protection for the Trust. The modified text significantly weakens this right by stating the Trust *may, at the Company's sole discretion, require* the transfer and retains the Company the final decision, effectively nullifying the Trust's right. Further, in the original section, it states the failure to exercise rights does not preclude the trust from seeking other remedies while the modified text states it does. This creates a direct conflict, making it unclear whether the Trust has a meaningful remedy in case of a Company Default.",

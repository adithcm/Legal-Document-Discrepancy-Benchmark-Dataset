You agree to comply with all mandatory specifications and procedures set forth from time to time in our confidential operating manual (the \"Manual\"). You acknowledge that the accounting practices, record keeping, software, services, and operation of your Franchised Business are important to us and our other franchisees. However, you acknowledge that we have the right to vary our standards and specifications, in our reasonable judgment, to accommodate circumstances of individual franchisees.",

You agree to comply with all mandatory specifications and procedures set forth from time to time in our confidential operating manual (the \"Manual\"). You acknowledge that the accounting practices, record keeping, software, services, and operation of your Franchised Business are important to us and our other franchisees. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that there will be absolutely no variations to our standards and specifications, as these are essential to the brand and system integrity, and any deviations are strictly prohibited.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Initially, the clause allows for some variation in standards to accommodate franchisees. The modification removes this flexibility, stating that there will be absolutely no variations, which is a complete contradiction.",

If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum payment in an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your Royalty fees and Advertising Contributions due for the last 60 months before our delivery of notice of default (or, if lesser, the months you had been operating before our delivery of notice of default), (b) multiplied by the lesser of 60 or the number of months remaining in the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "16.4. Liquidated Damages. If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you may be required, at our sole discretion, to pay us a lump-sum payment. The amount, if any, will be determined based on negotiations at the time of termination and will take into consideration factors such as the severity of the default, your past compliance record, and our anticipated losses, subject to our sole discretion. If we do not request such payment, then all obligations for liquidated damages are waived.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty by replacing the clear calculation with a discretionary process. It's unclear whether any payment will be required and the amount is subject to negotiation, which contradicts the original fixed calculation.",

Any and all claims and actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the relationship between you and us, or your operation of the Restaurant, brought by any party hereto against the other, must be commenced within one (1) year from the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such claim or action, or, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed by all parties, such claim or action will be irrevocably barred.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we retain the right to bring claims against you at any point during and after the contract for actions that harm our brand.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by stating that claims must be brought within one year, but then granting the franchisor an unlimited time to bring claims for actions harming the brand. This creates an imbalance and uncertainty about the actual limitations period.",

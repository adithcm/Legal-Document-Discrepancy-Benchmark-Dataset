                "original_text": "25. DISPUTES 25.1. Submission to Mediation. Except as otherwise provided in Section 25.7 [Remedies Not Exclusive] below, any controversy or claim arising between us will first be submitted to non-binding mediation administered by an established, neutral mediation service with experience in franchise disputes. Both parties must sign a confidentiality agreement before participating in any mediation proceeding. The mediation will take place in the city where our principal offices are located at the time the demand for mediation is filed. Once either party has submitted a dispute to mediation, the obligation to attend will be binding on both parties. Each party will bear its own costs with respect to the mediation. The fee for the mediation, however, will be split equally. 25.2. Forum for Litigation. You and the Owners must file any suit against us, and we may file any suit against you, in the federal or state court where our principal office is located at the time the suit is filed. The parties waive all questions of personal jurisdiction and venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision. 25.3. Mutual Waiver of Class Actions. Any lawsuit, claim, counterclaim, or other action may be conducted only on an individual basis, and not as part of a consolidated, common, or class action. 25.4. Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial. You and we each irrevocably waive trial by jury in any litigation.",

Except as otherwise provided in Section 25.7 [Remedies Not Exclusive] below, any controversy or claim arising between us may be submitted to non-binding mediation administered by a mediation service. Both parties may opt to sign a confidentiality agreement before participating in any mediation proceeding. The mediation will take place in a location chosen at the franchisor's discretion. Once either party has submitted a dispute to mediation, there is no obligation to attend by both parties. Each party will bear its own costs with respect to the mediation. The fee for the mediation will be determined by the mediator. 25.2. Forum for Litigation.

Mutual Waiver of Class Actions. Any lawsuit, claim, counterclaim, or other action may be conducted on either an individual basis, or as part of a consolidated, common, or class action. 25.4. Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial. You and we may elect to have a trial by jury in any litigation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by making mediation optional, changing the location to the franchisor's discretion, and removing the obligation to attend, whereas the original text mandates mediation and dictates its terms. It also allows for class action lawsuits and removes the waiver for jury trials, conflicting with the original text. This introduces uncertainty in how disputes will be handled and greatly alters the legal recourse available.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original non-compete clause by encouraging competition after termination. The original text restricts competitive activities for two years within a three-mile radius, while the modified text removes these restrictions entirely and suggests that competition is welcomed, creating a direct contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original royalty terms by making the royalty payment discretionary, linking it to specific services rendered by the franchisor, and potentially waiving the requirement for certain components of Gross Revenues.

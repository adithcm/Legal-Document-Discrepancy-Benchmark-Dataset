Adaptimmune may disclose any Data it generates to MD Anderson at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly stated that all Data is owned by Adaptimmune Limited, but then MD Anderson has usage rights. The modified version makes the data ownership jointly between both parties and makes the other terms of usage less clear. Also, removing \"promptly\" from data disclosure by MD Anderson to Adaptimmune is an in-text conflict. The original text provided MD Anderson with the right to use results and data of the study but the modified version is that Adaptimmune's written approval needs to be in place before the usage. This creates a contradiction and uncertainty about the freedom and restrictions surrounding the data ownership and usage rights. The last line also creates uncertainty: Adaptimmune's disclosure is at its sole discretion.",

                "explanation": "The original text gives Adaptimmune the first right to publish, but allows MD Anderson to independently publish after a certain period. The modified text requires MD Anderson to get Adaptimmune's approval, and Adaptimmune can deny the approval. The modified line creates a contradiction. The additional line stating that MD Anderson's publication rights extend indefinitely after study completion contradicts the prior sentence which stipulates that they can only publish with Adaptimmune's approval, making the terms of publication unclear.",

                "explanation": "The first sentence of Section 15.1 explicitly states that neither party makes any warranties regarding the results of any study or the study drug. By adding the statement \"ADAPTIMMUNE FURTHER WARRANTS THAT THE STUDY DRUG WILL ACHIEVE PRE-DETERMINED EFFICACY TARGETS OUTLINED IN EXHIBIT V.\" directly after it, the new text now implies that there are warranties about the results or effects of the study drug which contradicts the no warranties statement at the start of the paragraph. Adding the sentence directly after the exclusion creates an explicit internal contradiction. If this language were used, there could be an argument that the parties agreed there were no specific guarantees or results, while simultaneously having efficacy expectations for the drug.",

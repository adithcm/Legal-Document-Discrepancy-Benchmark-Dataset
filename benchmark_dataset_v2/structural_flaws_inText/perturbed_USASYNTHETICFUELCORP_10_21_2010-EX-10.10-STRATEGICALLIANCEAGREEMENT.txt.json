                "original_text": "Confidential Information shall not be used for any purpose other than to evaluate and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not be disclosed without prior written consent of the other Party, except to: (i) those employees with a need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of performing work related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however that the Parties shall require all such employees receiving the Confidential Information abide by the terms of this confidentiality covenant. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its employees or Affiliates; or (ii) those advisors, agents, contractors or lenders with a need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of performing work related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however that the Parties shall require all such advisors, agents, contractors or lenders to agree to abide by the terms of this Agreement and to undertake the same obligations as the Parties have undertaken hereunder. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its advisors, agents, contractors or lenders.",
                "changed_text": "Confidential Information may be used at the discretion of each party for any purpose they deem fit, including purposes unrelated to this agreement. Disclosure of Confidential Information is permitted without prior written consent of the other Party, including, but not limited to: (i) those employees with or without a need to know the Confidential Information, regardless of their role or relationship to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however that the Parties are not required to ensure that employees abide by any confidentiality restrictions. Each Party is not responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its employees or Affiliates; or (ii) those advisors, agents, contractors or lenders, regardless of their need to know the Confidential Information or their agreement to abide by any confidentiality restrictions. Each Party is not responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its advisors, agents, contractors or lenders.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text, which explicitly restricts the use and disclosure of Confidential Information. The original clause requires consent, limits use to purposes related to the agreement, and holds parties responsible for breaches by their employees, affiliates, and advisors. The modified text removes these restrictions, allowing for discretionary use, permitting disclosure to anyone, waiving the requirement for confidentiality agreements, and removing responsibility for breaches. This creates significant uncertainty regarding the protection of Confidential Information.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be for an initial term of five (5) years, and unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement, shall automatically renew for an additional term of five (5) years thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be for an initial term of five (5) years, and any renewal will be subject to negotiation and written agreement by both parties at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the initial term. If no such agreement is reached, the agreement will terminate at the end of the initial term.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies an automatic renewal of the agreement for an additional five years. The modified text eliminates this automatic renewal, requiring both parties to explicitly agree to a renewal. This creates uncertainty about the agreement's term because it is now dependent on mutual agreement, which may or may not occur, directly conflicting with the initial 'automatic' renewal clause.",

                "changed_text": "In the event either Party files an action to enforce or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, each party will be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and court costs, regardless of the outcome of the action. The court may, at its sole discretion, award attorneys' fees to the prevailing party only in cases of blatant and intentional breach of contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the prevailing party in any enforcement action is entitled to attorneys' fees and court costs. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating that each party is responsible for their own fees, irrespective of who wins. While it allows for a court's discretion to award fees in cases of blatant breach, this is far from guaranteed and creates a conflict with the initial entitlement to fees for the prevailing party. This creates uncertainty in the financial consequences of pursuing legal action to enforce the agreement.",

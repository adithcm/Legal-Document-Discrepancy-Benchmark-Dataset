                "original_text": "Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\"). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent, if any, that Consultant has rights in or to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (\"Aduro IP\"), Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to Aduro, and to the extent that an executory assignment is not enforceable, Consultant hereby agrees to assign and transfer to Aduro, in writing, from time to time, upon request, any and all right, title, or interest that Consultant has or may obtain in any Work Product and/or Aduro IP without the necessity of further consideration. Aduro shall be entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto. At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product. Such assistance may include, but will not be limited to, signing applications and other documents, cooperating in legal proceedings, and taking any other steps considered necessary or desirable by Aduro.",
                "changed_text": "Aduro shall have the option, but not the obligation, to become the owner of any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\"). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent the Consultant retains rights to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (\"Aduro IP\"), Consultant grants Aduro a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to use such Work Product and/or Aduro IP.  Consultant retains all rights to copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks unless Aduro exercises its option to acquire full ownership. At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates assignment of all Work Product to Aduro. The modified version gives Aduro an option to own the Work Product, conflicting with the original mandatory assignment. It also grants Aduro a license instead of full ownership if the option isn't exercised, contradicting the initial automatic assignment and creating ambiguity about ownership and usage rights. The retention of rights to copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks also creates uncertainty",

                "original_text": "Consultant's relationship to Aduro shall be that of an independent contractor. Consultant shall be responsible for the timely payment of his or her own self-employment and income taxes. Neither party shall have any authority to bind the other.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant's relationship to Aduro shall be that of an independent contractor, unless otherwise directed by Aduro. Consultant shall be responsible for the timely payment of his or her own self-employment and income taxes, except where Aduro provides direct compensation. Aduro shall have the authority to direct Consultant in matters pertaining to the Services.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the Consultant as an independent contractor, explicitly stating neither party can bind the other. The modified text introduces exceptions, stating Aduro can direct the consultant, and in some cases, will provide direct compensation. These exceptions blur the lines between independent contractor and employee, creating a contradiction and uncertainty about the nature of the relationship and potentially impacting tax liabilities and other legal obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time on prior written notice to the other, except for Aduro, which may terminate the agreement without notice under certain circumstances, including but not limited to, breach of confidentiality. This Agreement may be extended at Aduro's sole discretion without written agreement of the Consultant.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that either party may terminate the agreement with prior written notice and extension requires mutual written agreement. The modified version creates an exception for Aduro, allowing it to terminate the agreement without notice under certain conditions and extend the agreement without the consultant's agreement. This contradicts the original clause, creating uncertainty and imbalance in the rights of the parties.",

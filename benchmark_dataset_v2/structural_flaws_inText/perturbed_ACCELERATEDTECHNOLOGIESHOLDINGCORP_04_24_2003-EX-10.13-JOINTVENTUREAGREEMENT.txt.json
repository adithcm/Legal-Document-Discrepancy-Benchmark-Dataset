                "original_text": "Except as agreed upon by mutual consent, the Joint Venturers shall not be required to make any capital contribution to the Joint Venture.",
                "changed_text": "The Joint Venturers shall be required to make capital contributions to the Joint Venture as determined necessary by either Joint Venturer, regardless of mutual consent.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. Initially, capital contributions required mutual consent, offering predictability. The modification allows either Joint Venturer to unilaterally demand capital contributions, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over funding obligations.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination.",
                "changed_text": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until terminated by either party with a thirty (30) day notice, regardless of the original termination date. This termination clause supersedes any prior agreement regarding the venture's term.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed term with a renewal clause based on mutual written agreement. The changed text allows unilateral termination by either party with 30 days' notice, contradicting the initial fixed term and the requirement for mutual agreement to extend the venture. This introduces uncertainty about the venture's lifespan and the parties' commitment.",

            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "No Joint Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided, however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown in Section 6.",
                "changed_text": "A Joint Venturer may unilaterally withdraw funds or property from the Joint Venture at any time, regardless of the other Joint Venturer's consent. However, this right to withdraw is limited to 10% of the Joint Venturer's capital contribution per quarter. All other distributions will adhere to the original terms.",
                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibits withdrawals without mutual consent and outlines specific conditions for distributions. The modified clause introduces a contradictory exception, allowing unilateral withdrawals up to a certain limit, overriding the original requirement for mutual consent and potentially disrupting the financial stability of the Joint Venture. This exception directly conflicts with the initial restriction and creates uncertainty about the financial obligations and rights of each party.",

JRVS MAKES NO WARRANTIES TO THE DISTRIBUTOR OR CUSTOMERS. 10.2 Warranty Period. JRVS shall provide a limited warranty of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery to the Distributor for each of the Products against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service from the date of delivery to the Distributor. The Distributor shall notify JRVS of such defects within 15 days of discovery. 10.3 No Other Warranty.

                "explanation": "Section 10.1 explicitly states that JRVS provides no warranties. However, the new text in Section 10.2 introduces a 'limited warranty of ninety (90) days'. This directly contradicts the initial 'no warranties' statement, creating uncertainty about the warranty terms.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that the Distributor cannot export the products outside of Taiwan. The changed version allows exporting of products outside of Taiwan to countries approved by JRVS. This directly contradicts the previous statement and can cause ambiguity in determining distributor's obligations.",

This Agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason or no reason, whether or not extended beyond the initial term, by giving the other party written notice ninety (90) days in advance. However, JRVS may terminate this agreement with only 30 days' notice for any reason.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires 90 days' notice for termination by either party. The altered clause introduces an exception where JRVS can terminate with only 30 days' notice. This creates a contradictory condition within the same clause, making the termination terms unclear and potentially leading to disputes about the required notice period.",

                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, except that Heritage may terminate the agreement at any time with 30 days written notice, regardless of any conflicting terms in the original agreement. Premier may only terminate the agreement under the conditions specified in the original agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding termination rights. The original text states that all other terms remain in effect. By adding the exception allowing Heritage to terminate at any time with 30 days notice, and restricting Premier to the original terms, we create a conflict. This contradicts the original agreement's termination clauses and introduces uncertainty about when and how each party can terminate.",

The following *may* be attached to and incorporated into the Agreement as Schedule C-1:\n\nSchedule C-1([***])\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the original Schedule C-1 shall remain in effect for all transactions completed prior to July 3, 2019.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Schedule C-1 is removed and replaced. The modified text introduces uncertainty by using 'may' instead of 'is' in the replacement statement, suggesting the new Schedule C-1 attachment is not mandatory. Then, by stating that the *original* Schedule C-1 applies retroactively, we directly contradict the initial removal and replacement statement, creating confusion about which schedule applies to which transactions.",

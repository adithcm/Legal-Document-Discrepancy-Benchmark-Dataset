                "changed_text": "The undersigned understands and agrees that as to GSMS he may or may not be considered an \"affiliate\" depending on the interpretation of Rule 145(c) as defined in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"1933 Act\"), and the determination will be made at the sole discretion of PSS legal counsel at the time of the Merger.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the undersigned as an 'affiliate'. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the 'affiliate' status is subject to interpretation and the discretion of PSS legal counsel. This contradicts the original clear definition, creating uncertainty about the undersigned's status and the associated obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that PSS has 'no obligation' to file a registration statement. The modified text contradicts this by saying PSS 'may, at its sole discretion,' file such a statement. This introduces uncertainty about PSS's responsibility and the conditions under which they might assist with the disposition of shares, potentially conflicting with the affiliate's understanding of their rights and obligations.",

The availability of such filings for the benefit of the undersigned in relation to Rule 145(d) compliance cannot be guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that PSS 'agrees...to file on a timely basis' reports. The modified text weakens this obligation by stating that PSS is not required but 'will use commercially reasonable efforts,' and explicitly states that the availability of such reports is not guaranteed. This creates uncertainty and contradicts the original commitment, possibly affecting the affiliate's ability to transfer shares under Rule 145(d).",

                "explanation": "The original text grants FMI the power to decide on infringement suits on their patents, and Roche on theirs. For joint patents, if one party doesn't act, the other can. This version makes Roche decide on FMI patents and vice versa, and states that if one party doesn't act the other can not act. This introduces a contradiction as who is responsible for acting on infringement of background rights.",

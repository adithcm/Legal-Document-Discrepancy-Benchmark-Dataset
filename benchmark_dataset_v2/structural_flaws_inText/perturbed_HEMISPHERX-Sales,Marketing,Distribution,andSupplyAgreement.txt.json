SCIEN shall pay HEMISPHERX for each order of Product within 75 days after receipt of the goods except for the for first purchase order which will be for 50 vials of Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived) (\"First Order\") and paid once the MOH approves the use for Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived) on 5 MERS patients. All purchase orders are final.",

All purchase orders are subject to mutual agreement and adjustment based on market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'All purchase orders are final', implying a binding commitment. The modified text adds 'subject to mutual agreement and adjustment based on market conditions,' which contradicts the finality of the orders. This introduces uncertainty in the commitment to purchase.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing , Confidential Information of a Party shall not include information which the other Party can establish by written documentation was (a) to have been publicly known prior to disclosure of such information by the disclosing Party to the other Party, (b) to have become publicly known, without fault on the part of the other Party, subsequent to disclosure of such information by such information by the disclosing Party to the other Party, (c) to have been received by the other Party at any time from a source , other than the disclosing Party, rightfully having possession of and the right to disclose such information, (d) to have been otherwise known by the other Party prior to disclosure of such information by the disclosing Party to the other Party, or (e) to have been independently developed by employees or agents of the other Party without access to or use of such information disclosed by the disclosing Party to the other Party.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'until 5 years after the expiration' to 'indefinitely after the expiration' creates a direct contradiction within the same paragraph. The opening sentence indicates perpetual confidentiality, which is then undermined by the detailed exceptions that follow. This could lead to disputes about which exceptions actually apply and for how long. The definition creates uncertainty about which information is truly protected and for what duration.",

If exercised within the first two (2) years HEMISPHERX will pay SCIEN three (3) times the Product sales for the preceding 12 months. If exercised after year 3, HEMISPHERX will pay SCIEN two (2) times the Product sales for the preceding 12 months.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a clear financial formula for the buyout. The modified version replaces the guaranteed payment within the first 2 years with 'HEMISPHERX and SCIEN will agree at the time of buyout the financial terms'. This contradicts the subsequent sentence because the terms would be determined by 'HEMISPHERX and SCIEN will agree at the time of buyout the financial terms'. If the company buys out within the first two years, the buyout would be up in the air and only the buyout after the third year will have a fixed calculation.",

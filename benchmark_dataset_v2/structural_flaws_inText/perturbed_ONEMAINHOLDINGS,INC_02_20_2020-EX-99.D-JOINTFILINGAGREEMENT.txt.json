                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts; however, such execution does not guarantee that all parties are bound by the agreement unless explicitly confirmed in writing by each party.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that counterparts 'shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement,' creating a clear commitment. The altered text introduces uncertainty by adding that execution of counterparts doesn't necessarily bind all parties unless confirmed in writing, which contradicts the original automatic binding. This uncertainty could lead to disputes about whether all parties are actually bound by the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, however, the validity and enforceability of this agreement are contingent upon a separate unanimous resolution passed by all entities mentioned below within 10 business days of the last counterpart's execution. Failure to pass said resolution renders the agreement null and void.",
                "explanation": "The original states the agreement's validity upon signing counterparts. The added condition of a unanimous resolution within 10 days contradicts this, potentially voiding the agreement despite signed counterparts. It creates uncertainty regarding when the agreement is truly in effect.",

This Agreement may be terminated by any party, at any time, with written notice to the other parties, notwithstanding any other provision herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear agreement for joint filing. The added clause allowing unilateral termination directly contradicts the initial confirmation of agreement for joint filing. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the parties' commitment to the joint filing, as any party can withdraw at any time.",

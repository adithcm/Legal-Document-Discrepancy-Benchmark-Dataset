                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement *may* be included as an Exhibit to such filing, subject to further review.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Agreement 'be included' as an exhibit, creating an obligation. The modified text changes this to 'may be included,' introducing an element of discretion and contradicting the initial mandatory inclusion. This creates uncertainty as to whether the agreement is actually intended to be an exhibit.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that any number of counterparts are permissible and each is deemed an original. The modified text contradicts this by limiting the number of counterparts and stating they are duplicates unless certified. This introduces a contradiction regarding the validity and nature of the counterparts, thus creating uncertainty and differing standards of requirements",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the undersigned 'hereby execute' the agreement, indicating a completed action. The modified text changes this to 'intend to execute,' adding a condition of 'pending final internal approvals,' which introduces uncertainty as to whether the agreement will actually be executed and when. This contradicts the original statement of immediate execution.",

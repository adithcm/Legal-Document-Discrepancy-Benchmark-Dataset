Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party shall not be deemed to lack control of intellectual property if granting access requires violating the terms of any agreement with a third party.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence directly contradicts the original definition by stating that violating third-party agreements does *not* negate control, while the original definition states the opposite. This creates ambiguity about when a party can be compelled to grant access to IP.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction by stating that some decisions are resolved based on later subsections, and then saying *all* decisions ultimately are resolved by BLI.

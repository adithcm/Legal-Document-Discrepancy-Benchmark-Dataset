                "changed_text": "Section 6.1 of the Agreement shall be, and hereby is, amended by deleting the date \"September 30, 2003\" where it appears therein, and inserting in its place the date \"July 20, 2006\". Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Manager retains the right to terminate this agreement at any point, for any reason, with thirty days' written notice. This termination right supersedes the stated end date.",
                "explanation": "This adds a contradictory clause to the section about the agreement's term. Initially, it specifies a clear end date (July 20, 2006). The added sentence allows the Manager to terminate the agreement at any time, effectively negating the defined end date and creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement. One clause specifies an end date, while the added clause implies the contract could end sooner at the Manager's discretion.",

                "changed_text": "In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. However, in cases of emergency, the Manager is authorized to make necessary changes to the Transmission Line without obtaining prior consent, as determined in their sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This adds a contradictory clause regarding changes to the Transmission Line. The original text clearly states that all changes require unanimous consent from partners. The added sentence allows the Manager to bypass this consent in 'emergency' situations. This creates uncertainty because the definition of 'emergency' is not provided and determined in sole discretion of Manager, contradicting the original requirement for unanimous consent and potentially allowing the Manager to make unilateral changes under the guise of an emergency.",

By execution of this Amendment, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. hereby become parties to the Agreement and agree to be bound by all of the terms of the Agreement and this Amendment.",
                "changed_text": "Except as expressly modified by Section 1 of this Amendment, all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. However, nothing in this agreement shall compel the Manager to fulfill any obligation if doing so will result in a loss of profit, which will be determined by the sole discretion of the Manager. By execution of this Amendment, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. hereby become parties to the Agreement and agree to be bound by all of the terms of the Agreement and this Amendment.",
                "explanation": "This adds a contradictory clause regarding the Manager's obligations. The original text states that all terms and conditions remain in effect. The added sentence allows the Manager to disregard any obligation if fulfilling it would result in a loss of profit. This contradicts the original statement because it introduces a significant exception to the Manager's obligations, undermining the enforceability of the contract's terms. This is up to the sole discretion of the Manager. This creates significant ambiguity about the Manager's actual responsibilities under the agreement.",

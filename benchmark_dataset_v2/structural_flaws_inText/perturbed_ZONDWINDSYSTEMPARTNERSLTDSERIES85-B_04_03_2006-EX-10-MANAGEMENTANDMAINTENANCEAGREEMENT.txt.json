                "original_text": "In addition to the other rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners (or their Partner Affiliates), Manager shall disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the \"LIFO Partners\") in the following circumstances. If at any time, and for any reason other than force majeure affecting the Transmission Line, (i) the Transmission Line is incapable of delivering power at its designed capacity, availability or voltage and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would improve the capability of the transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or (ii) the Transmission Line line losses exceed 1.14%, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Mariah, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Beta Mariah, Beta Mariah (Prime), or Gamma Mariah or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, or (iii) the Transmission Line line losses for either of the power purchase contracts commonly known as Desert Winds I and Desert Winds III exceed the levels experienced immediately prior to the addition of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to the Transmission Line, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Joshua, Alpha Joshua (Prime), Beta Joshua, Beta Willow or Beta Willow (Prime) or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, then the Manager shall curtail the Projects of the LIFO Partners.",
                "changed_text": "In addition to the other rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners (or their Partner Affiliates), the Manager may, at its sole discretion, disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the \"LIFO Partners\") in the following circumstances. If at any time, and for any reason, the Manager deems it necessary, (i) the Transmission Line is operating sub-optimally, or (ii) the Transmission Line line losses exceed acceptable limits, or (iii) the Transmission Line line losses exceed historical norms, then the Manager may curtail the Projects of the LIFO Partners.",
                "explanation": "The original text states \"Manager shall disconnect...\" creating an obligation. The modified text states \"Manager may, at its sole discretion, disconnect...\" giving the manager the right, but not the obligation, to disconnect. This introduces contradiction and uncertainty around the circumstances under which LIFO Partners' projects will be disconnected. The original text outlined specific conditions related to the transmission line’s capability. The modified text broadens these conditions to ‘operating sub-optimally’ or exceeding ‘acceptable limits,’ introducing subjectivity. The change from \"shall\" to \"may\" introduces uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners. Such curtailment shall continue until the Manager shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment.",
                "changed_text": "Any curtailment under this provision may be in any amount deemed appropriate by the Manager, and may or may not improve the Transmission Line. Such curtailment may continue indefinitely, at the Manager's discretion, regardless of whether the conditions giving rise to the curtailment have been resolved.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that curtailment must be sufficient to restore the Transmission Line's performance, implying a limit. The modified text states that curtailment 'may be in any amount' and may continue 'indefinitely', contradicting the purpose-driven and time-limited nature of the original curtailment clause. The phrase \"may or may not improve the Transmission Line\" directly contradicts the original intent that curtailment is for specific improvements, injecting ambiguity. It introduces contradictions around the scope and duration of curtailment.",

                "original_text": "If the LIFO Partners shall inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager shall effect any curtailment under these provisions according to such priority. If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager shall in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail.",
                "changed_text": "Even if the LIFO Partners inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager may disregard such agreement and curtail projects in any order it deems appropriate. If the LIFO Partners fail to inform the Manager, the Manager will select projects to curtail at random.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that the Manager follows the curtailment priority agreed upon by the LIFO partners, if communicated in writing. The modified text states the Manager may disregard such agreement, negating the previous requirement and directly contradicting the priority agreed upon by the LIFO partners. Changing from Manager's discretion to curtailing 'at random' adds inconsistency. This introduces contradictions around the control that the LIFO Partners have over the curtailment of their Projects, potentially leading to disputes.",

LeadersOnline shall have the option, subject to VerticalNet's approval exercised in its sole  and absolute discretion, to extend the Term of this Agreement for an additional 12 months (a \"Renewal Term\") on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. To exercise this option, LeadersOnline must notify VerticalNet in writing of its election no later than 90 days prior to the expiration of the initial Term. Unless VerticalNet notifies LeadersOnline of its intention to extend the initial Term of this Agreement for an additional year within 30 days of receiving such notice the Agreement shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.",

LeadersOnline shall have the option, subject to VerticalNet's approval exercised reasonably, to extend the Term of this Agreement for an additional 12 months (a \"Renewal Term\") on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties.

                "explanation": "The original clause grants VerticalNet 'sole and absolute discretion' regarding renewal approval. The modified version removes this and replaces it with 'approval exercised reasonably'. This change introduces a contradiction. Previously, VerticalNet had unrestricted power to deny renewal. Now, LeadersOnline could argue that VerticalNet's denial was unreasonable, leading to a dispute and making the renewal terms uncertain.",

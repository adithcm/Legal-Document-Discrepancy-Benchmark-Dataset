                "original_text": "1.15 \"Diligent Efforts\" means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party, with respect to any objective, reasonable, good faith efforts to accomplish such objective as such Party would normally use to accomplish a similar objective under similar circumstances for such Party's benefit. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to efforts relating to the Development of, obtaining Marketing Approval or Pricing and Reimbursement Approval for, or Commercialization of the Product, generally or with respect to any particular country, \"Diligent Efforts\" means a sustained, continued and active commitment of efforts and resources by a Party consistent with those normally applied in the pharmaceutical industry with respect to compounds or products with similar market at a similar stage in the product life cycle that such Party is actively developing or commercializing (as applicable), taking into account the stage and risk of development or commercialization of the Product, issues of safety or efficacy, the cost effectiveness of efforts or resources while optimizing profitability, the competitiveness of alternative Third Party compounds, products or generics that are or are expected to be in the marketplace, the scope and duration of Patents or other intellectual property rights related to the compound or product (including any Regulatory Exclusivity), the profitability of the Product (including pricing and reimbursement status achieved or likely to be achieved) or other relevant commercial factors, but not taking into account (a) any other pharmaceutical product such Party is then researching, developing or commercializing, alone or with one or more collaborators, or (b) any payments required to be made to the other Party hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "1.15 \"Diligent Efforts\" means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party, with respect to any objective, good faith efforts to accomplish such objective as such Party deems appropriate in its sole discretion. Diligent Efforts may, but are not required to, take into account commercial factors. For efforts relating to the Development, obtaining Marketing Approval, Pricing and Reimbursement Approval, or Commercialization of the Product, Diligent Efforts means efforts and resources consistent with those applied in the pharmaceutical industry, but only if the Party considers such efforts to be in its best interest. Issues of safety, efficacy, cost effectiveness, competitiveness, profitability, the scope and duration of Patents or other intellectual property rights, pricing and reimbursement status, alternative Third Party compounds, or other commercial factors may or may not be considered at the sole discretion of the Party. A Party may take into account (a) any other pharmaceutical product such Party is then researching, developing or commercializing, alone or with one or more collaborators, or (b) any payments required to be made to the other Party hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Diligent Efforts sets a reasonable, good faith standard tied to industry norms and commercial factors. The modified definition introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation by allowing a Party to act in its sole discretion, potentially disregarding industry standards and commercial factors, creating uncertainty regarding the level of effort required and making enforcement difficult.",

Ono hereby grants to Array a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license, with the right to issue and authorize sublicenses through multiple tiers subject to the last sentence of Section 2.4(b), under any Improvements and Ono's interest in Joint Patent and Joint Know-How solely to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, the Products (collectively, the \"Grant-Back License\"), subject to the exclusive rights granted to Ono under this Agreement. Promptly following the execution of a sublicense to a Third Party Partner, Array shall notify Ono of such sublicense in writing.",

Ono may grant to Array a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license, without the right to issue and authorize sublicenses, under any Improvements and Ono's interest in Joint Patent and Joint Know-How to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, the Products (collectively, the \"Grant-Back License\"), subject to the exclusive rights granted to Ono under this Agreement. Array may sublicense under the Grant-Back License if Ono provides written approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Array a non-exclusive license under Improvements and Joint Patents/Know-How with the right to sublicense. The modified version introduces internal contradiction by saying Ono 'may' grant the license, creating ambiguity if it is required, and removes the sublicense rights previously afforded to Array. Also, the phrase 'without the right to issue and authorize sublicenses' is immediately contradicted by the language granting that power 'if Ono provides written approval'. It is unclear if Ono has the power to unilaterally end the rights, making the clause difficult to enforce.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, following registration of the Product Trademark(s) by Array in the Ono Territory pursuant to Section 12.3 below, Array shall assign, and shall cause its Affiliates to assign, to Ono all rights to the Product Trademark(s) so registered in the Ono Territory at Ono's cost and expense, in each case solely for the purpose of Commercializing the Products in the Ono Territory in accordance with this Agreement.

Array shall retain ownership of product trademarks. Ono shall be responsible for some maintenance of such Product Trademark(s) at its cost and expense in the Ono Territory, as determined by Array.",
                "explanation": "The original text unambiguously states that Array 'shall assign' all rights to the Product Trademarks to Ono. The modified version changes this to 'Array may assign some or all rights' contradicting the original intent and introducing uncertainty as to which specific rights will be transferred to Ono, and also whether Array has the power to adjust it's maintenance responsibilities unilaterally. This could lead to disputes over the control and use of the trademarks.",

SONY retains the right to sue and collect damages for any past infringement of the  Transferred Patents, provided that SONY obtains PURCHASER's written consent prior to making any infringement claim or allegation or filing any  action, suit, litigation or proceeding that could affect the Transferred Patents or PURCHASER's ability to use and exploit the Transferred Patents  or that may result in PURCHASER being joined as a party to the action, suit, litigation or proceeding.

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that SONY assigns the right to sue for future infringement to the PURCHASER. The changed text contradicts this by stating that the right to sue for future infringement is subject to SONY's sole discretion. The original stated that SONY retains the right to sue for *past* infringement, but *future* infringement rights go to the PURCHASER. Then PURCHASER's consent is required for any action, suit, litigation or proceeding, which contradicts PURCHASER's previously given explicit control. This makes it unclear who controls the right to sue for future infringement and under what conditions.",

                "explanation": "The original grants PURCHASER a license that is \"fully paid-up, royalty-free\". Adding the clause that 'this license is subject to SONY's ongoing review and may be revoked at any time if PURCHASER's use is deemed detrimental to SONY's interests' contradicts the original grant. A fully paid and royalty-free license means that PURCHASER has rights to use and the fact that it can be revoked at any time introduces conflict and uncertainty about the rights of PURCHASER.",

                "explanation": "The original states the agreement lasts until the expiration of the IP rights. The modified version states it lasts for five years, but then SONY can extend it indefinitely, causing a contradiction. Does the agreement expire after five years? Or longer?

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G may be filed individually. The undersigned acknowledge that each *may* be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, regardless of whether he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "explanation": "The original text asserts a joint filing agreement and individual responsibility with exceptions. The modified text introduces contradiction by stating amendments *may* be filed individually, and responsibility for accuracy of personal information is not guaranteed. This creates uncertainty about whether joint filing is actually required and diminishes the accountability each party has to the others.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned may or may not agree with the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G, and the filing does not necessarily represent their individual views. Furthermore, they are under no obligation for subsequent amendments. Responsibility for amendments and information accuracy is solely determined by individual internal policies, regardless of any stated agreements herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text emphasizes agreement and responsibility. The changed version introduces a conflict by suggesting the parties may *not* agree, and there is no obligation for amendments, contradicting the joint filing agreement. It also implies that individual internal policies supersede any stated agreements, creating substantial uncertainty about accountability and undermining the purpose of the joint filing.",

                "original_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). This Agreement will automatically renew for additional 1-year terms unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Agreement's express provisions (together with the Initial Term, such additional periods the \"Term\"). Neither Party may terminate this Agreement during the Initial Term except as set forth in paragraph 4(b) or any Exhibit.",
                "changed_text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). This Agreement may be renewed for additional 1-year terms if both parties agree in writing 30 days prior to the end of the current term. Either Party may terminate this Agreement during the Initial Term with a 30-day written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement automatically renews unless terminated. The modified text says renewal requires explicit agreement, contradicting the auto-renewal clause. Additionally, it now allows termination during the Initial Term, which was previously restricted, creating further uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "Payment from Kubient to Customer shall be made within thirty (30) days from Kubient's receipt of payment, provided Customer submits an invoice within 15 days of Kubient's receipt.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a payment term of seven days from Kubient's receipt, irrespective of the invoice date. The modified text extends the payment term to thirty days and adds a condition that Customer's invoice is submitted within 15 days of Kubient's receipt, contradicting the original payment term and adding a new requirement for invoice submission.",

                "changed_text": "Recipient will protect the Confidential Information indefinitely, using a reasonable degree of care to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, or publication. However, this obligation ceases if the Discloser publicly discloses the same information.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits the confidentiality obligation to one year. The changed text extends this indefinitely but adds a condition where confidentiality ceases if the disclosing party reveals the information themselves, creating an inconsistency. It's now unclear when exactly the confidentiality ends.",

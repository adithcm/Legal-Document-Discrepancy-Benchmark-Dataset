                "original_text": "Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned in the SLCMA.",
                "changed_text": "Each capitalized term used but not defined herein may have a meaning that is independent of the SLCMA, and Supplier may provide an alternative interpretation. The Bank of America may request clarification on any capitalized term, but the Supplier's interpretation will be final.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty by suggesting that capitalized terms might have different meanings than those in the SLCMA, contradicting the original clear reference to the SLCMA for definitions. It gives the Supplier the authority to offer its interpretation, which would cause dispute in the meaning of the text.",

Whether it is incorporated or not is to be determined later by Supplier.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly incorporates Schedule A into the SLCMA. The revised text introduces ambiguity by stating Schedule A 'may' be incorporated and that the supplier will determine that later. This contradicts the original statement and causes uncertainty about whether the content of Schedule A will be governed by the SLCMA.",

Supplier reserves the right to amend Schedule A with or without Bank of America's consent. Any amendments to Schedule A by the supplier override the current agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly incorporates Schedule A into the SLCMA. The revised text introduces ambiguity by stating Schedule A is 'conditionally' incorporated and allows Supplier to unilaterally amend Schedule A, which contradicts the original statement that both parties need to agree. This causes uncertainty about whether the content of Schedule A will be governed by the SLCMA.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned may, at their discretion, choose to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein. This agreement does not guarantee any such filing.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the parties 'agree to jointly prepare and file'. The modified text introduces discretion by saying 'may, at their discretion, choose to' and then clarifies that the agreement 'does not guarantee any such filing', directly contradicting the original mandatory language and creating uncertainty about the obligation to file jointly.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each may or may not be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and responsibility for completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein is waived. Each party assumes full responsibility for all information.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly assigns responsibility for timely filing and accuracy. The changed text introduces uncertainty ('may or may not be responsible') and then states responsibility is 'waived' before contridicting that statement with 'Each party assumes full responsibility'. This contradiction creates confusion about liability for errors or delays.",

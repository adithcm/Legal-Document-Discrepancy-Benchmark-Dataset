Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Term for all Properties may be terminated earlier at Fox's sole discretion with 30 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear expiration date for specific properties. The added sentence gives Fox the unilateral right to terminate the agreement early, even for those specified properties, contradicting the initially stated term and creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the license.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Agreement continues in full force and effect except for explicitly stated amendments. The added sentence allows Fox to unilaterally modify *any* clause of the Agreement, even those previously ratified, creating a contradiction and undermining the entire premise of a mutually agreed-upon contract. This makes the ratified sections uncertain.",

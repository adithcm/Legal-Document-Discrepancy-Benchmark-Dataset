                "explanation": "The original text allows the Supplier to amend the End User Agreement in its sole discretion. The modified text requires the Supplier to seek Reseller's approval, creating a contradiction and uncertainty about who has the authority to modify the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Reseller is appointed as a non-exclusive reseller. The modified text appoints the Reseller as an exclusive reseller but also provides for Supplier to appoint other resellers upon consent from the Reseller.

The modified text adds a condition that the Reseller can only terminate if there is a breach and that the supplier should determine that this is a breach. This change puts a condition to the Reseller's termination process which is a conflict from the original section.",

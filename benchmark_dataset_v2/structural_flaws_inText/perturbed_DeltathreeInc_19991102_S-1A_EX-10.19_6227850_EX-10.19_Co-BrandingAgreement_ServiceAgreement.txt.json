The services to be provided by PrimeCall in accordance with this Article III  [Services Provided by PrimeCall] shall be provided to DeltaThree in accordance with reasonable procedures for operation and may be changed from time to time if agreed upon by each of PrimeCall and DeltaThree.",

The services to be provided by PrimeCall in accordance with this Article III  [Services Provided by PrimeCall] shall be provided to DeltaThree in accordance with reasonable procedures for operation and may be changed from time to time at PrimeCall's sole discretion, without requiring DeltaThree's consent.",
                "explanation": "Originally, Section 3.07 stated that PrimeCall and DeltaThree must agree on any changes to the operational procedures for PrimeCall's services. The modified version contradicts this by granting PrimeCall the unilateral right to change these procedures without DeltaThree's approval, creating uncertainty about DeltaThree's control over the services they receive.",

This Agreement may not be assigned by DeltaThree without the prior written consent of PrimeCall. PrimeCall may assign this Agreement to any affiliate of PrimeCall or in connection with a merger or consolidation of PrimeCall or a sale of all or substantially all of PrimeCall's business.

Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this Agreement may not be assigned by PrimeCall without the prior written consent of DeltaThree.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that DeltaThree needs PrimeCall's consent to assign the agreement. The modified clause directly contradicts this by stating that DeltaThree can assign the agreement 'at will and without notifying PrimeCall.'

                "original_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date regardless of the aggregate net sales of the acquired business. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a specific exception to the non-compete clause: if a seller acquires control of a business after the effective date, the non-compete does not apply if that acquired business had less than $25,000,000 in aggregate net sales. The modified text removes this sales limit, stating 'regardless of the aggregate net sales of the acquired business.' This creates a contradiction because the original text implies that businesses with sales exceeding $25,000,000 *are* subject to the non-compete if acquired, while the modified text implies that *no* acquired business is subject to the non-compete regardless of sales. This introduces uncertainty about the scope of the non-compete agreement.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",

                "explanation": "The original text states a clear restriction: While Sellers can make general solicitations (clause 2), they *cannot* hire employees responding to those solicitations during the Non-Solicit Period. The modified text removes the 'not' from the 'shall not permit,' making it 'shall permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.' This creates a direct contradiction. The first sentence prohibits soliciting the *employment* of anyone at combined business and the final sentence allows for the soliciting *and hiring* during that period. This ambiguity makes the enforceability of the non-solicitation clause uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that in any legal action, the prevailing party *shall* be entitled to recover attorney's fees. The modified version changes this to *may* be entitled. This creates a contradiction by removing the mandatory entitlement to fees. The original text made it a guaranteed right, while the revised text makes it discretionary. This injects uncertainty into potential enforcement actions, as the recovery of attorney's fees is no longer assured, potentially deterring legal challenges.",

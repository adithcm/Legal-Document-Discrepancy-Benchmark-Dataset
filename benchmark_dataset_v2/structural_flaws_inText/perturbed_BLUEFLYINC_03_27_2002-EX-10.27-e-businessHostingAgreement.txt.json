Unless otherwise specified in the Service Option Attachment, renewal is contingent upon a review of service performance and pricing, and neither party is obligated to renew.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Service Option Attachment will auto-renew, unless written notice is given, whereas the modified text indicates that renewals are subject to mutual agreement, negating the automatic renewal provision. This creates ambiguity regarding the conditions for renewal.",

With respect to any confidential information contained in or traveling through the e-business Hosting Environment or Customer Components, the provisions of Sections 5, 9, and 10 herein will prevail to the extent of any inconsistent provisions in the confidentiality agreement.",
                "changed_text": "6.0 Confidentiality\n\nAll information exchanged between the parties is deemed confidential and shall be treated as such, subject to the terms outlined below. Any information disclosed by a party that a reasonable person would construe as confidential, based on its nature and the circumstances of disclosure, is deemed confidential Information. However, the company has the rights to use any Client information for sales and marketing unless the Client explicitly denies those rights in section 14.4. With respect to any confidential information contained in or traveling through the e-business Hosting Environment or Customer Components, the provisions of Sections 5, 9, and 10 herein will prevail to the extent of any inconsistent provisions in the confidentiality agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text first says that everything is non-confidential until a confidentiality agreement is executed. The modified version states that information is deemed confidential, but then it immediately allows the company to freely use \"any Client information for sales and marketing\" unless a separate denial is issued. This creates a contradiction: If all exchanged information is confidential, the company can not use all client information unless there's a written denial because that denial creates another set of rules that directly conflicts with the deemed confidential clause. The enforcement of 'confidentiality' becomes uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The original text limits legal actions to two years. The addition explicitly removes this time limit for IP and confidentiality, directly contradicting the initial statement. This creates uncertainty about which statute of limitations applies to different types of claims.",

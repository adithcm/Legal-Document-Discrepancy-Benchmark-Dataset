                "original_text": "Licenses granted herein are solely for products in the form sold by the Licensee and are not to be construed either (i) as consent by the Marv to any act which may be performed by the Licensee, except to the extent impacted by a patent licensed herein to the Licensee, or (ii) to include licenses to contributorily infringe or induce infringement under U.S. law or a foreign equivalent thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Licenses granted herein are solely for products in the form sold by the Licensee and are to be construed as consent by the Marv to any act which may be performed by the Licensee. These licenses also include licenses to contributorily infringe or induce infringement under U.S. law or a foreign equivalent thereof.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text. The original text explicitly states that the licenses should *not* be construed as consent for any act by the Licensee and do not include licenses to contributorily infringe. The modified text reverses this, creating a direct contradiction and uncertainty about the scope of the license.",

                "changed_text": "If THI denies payment, THI may still retain the license and all associated rights for that Application or Patent at Marv's sole discretion. Marv's decision will be based on various factors, including THI's past performance and the potential value of the Application or Patent.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that denial of payment results in reversion of the license to Marv. The changed text introduces ambiguity by stating THI *may* retain the license even after denying payment, contingent on Marv's discretion. This contradicts the original provision, making it unclear whether a denial of payment automatically leads to reversion, thus creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Marv may be reimbursed for some of the legal expenses associated with this agreement by THI, depending on THI's financial condition and at THI's sole discretion. Marv is responsible for tracking and submitting a detailed invoice for these costs to THI for consideration.",
                "explanation": "The original text dictates that THI *shall* reimburse Marv in full for legal expenses. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that Marv *may* be reimbursed for *some* expenses, dependent on THI's financial condition and discretion. This creates a clear contradiction regarding the obligation of reimbursement, potentially leading to disputes about the amount or even the possibility of any reimbursement.",

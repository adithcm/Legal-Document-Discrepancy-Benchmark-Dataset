Thereafter, the term \"Specified Royalty Percentage\" shall           mean (i) fifty percent (50%) from and after the first day of each           quarter of each fiscal year of Licensee\n\n          commencing with Licensee's fiscal year beginning April 1, 1999) until           such time, if any, during such quarter that the aggregate amount of           all Royalty Advances outstanding as of the first day of such quarter           (including the Royalty Advance payable on such first day) has been           credited against royalties earned hereunder (a \"Satisfaction Date\"),           and (ii) forty percent (40%) from and after a Satisfaction Date           through and including the last day of the fiscal quarter in which such           Satisfaction Date occurs.",

Thereafter, the term \"Specified Royalty Percentage\" shall be determined at the sole discretion of the Licensor, but will generally           mean (i) fifty percent (50%) from and after the first day of each           quarter of each fiscal year of Licensee\n\n          commencing with Licensee's fiscal year beginning April 1, 1999) until           such time, if any, during such quarter that the aggregate amount of           all Royalty Advances outstanding as of the first day of such quarter           (including the Royalty Advance payable on such first day) has been           credited against royalties earned hereunder (a \"Satisfaction Date\"),           and (ii) forty percent (40%) from and after a Satisfaction Date           through and including the last day of the fiscal quarter in which such           Satisfaction Date occurs. The Licensor may, at any time, change the Specified Royalty Percentage with 30 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a clear structure for calculating the 'Specified Royalty Percentage'. The modified text adds 'shall be determined at the sole discretion of the Licensor' and 'The Licensor may, at any time, change the Specified Royalty Percentage with 30 days written notice.' This contradicts the existing definition, creating uncertainty about how the royalty percentage is determined and whether the original calculation method still applies. It also creates uncertainty about which clause prevails.",

Repayment is subject to Licensor's financial condition at the time of termination or expiration.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Licensor 'shall repay' Royalty Advances upon termination or expiration. The modified text changes this to 'may, at its sole discretion, repay' introducing uncertainty. Adding the condition 'Repayment is subject to Licensor's financial condition' further weakens the obligation, making it unclear whether the Licensee will actually receive the repayment. This creates a contradiction as the first sentence implies the licensor will repay it, and the second provides leeway for them to delay or neglect repayment.",

Upon the expiration           of such term, this Agreement will renew automatically for           successive terms of one (1) year each unless either party to           this Agreement delivers written notice of termination to the           other party to this Agreement at least sixty (60) days prior           to the end of the original or any renewal term.",

The Licensor's decision to renew is final and not subject to dispute.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that renewal is automatic unless a party provides 60-day notice of termination. By changing it to renewal that 'may be renewed at the discretion of the licensor' creates a contradiction. Now there is unclarity, and the automatic renewal is superseded. This affects the rights of the Licensee.",

                "original_text": "1.1.42 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the performance of activities under this Agreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): reasonable, diligent, good-faith efforts to accomplish such objective which are consistent with industry standards for companies of comparable size as that of such Party. \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" requires, with respect to a particular task or activity in making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, exporting, developing (including seeking regulatory approvals or applicable pricing or reimbursement approvals) or otherwise commercializing the Product, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such task or activity to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis; (ii) set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such task or activity; and (iii) make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives in accordance with established timelines; provided, however, that, to the extent that the performance of a Party's obligations hereunder is adversely affected by the other Party's breach in performing its obligations hereunder, the impact on the first Party of such performance failure by the other Party will be taken into account in determining whether the first Party has used its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform any such affected obligations.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.42 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the performance of activities under this Agreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): efforts that a Party deems reasonable at their sole discretion, without needing to adhere to industry standards or specific actions. The determination of what constitutes Commercially Reasonable Efforts is at the Party's exclusive judgment, allowing flexibility in response to unforeseen circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" requires diligence, good faith, and consistency with industry standards. The modified version allows each Party to subjectively determine what is reasonable. This introduces a contradiction because the contract now lacks an objective standard for evaluating a party's performance, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that SFJ 'shall pay' a specific amount. By changing it to 'SFJ may, at its sole discretion, pay to', SFJ is no longer obligated to pay and PB has no right to receive that money. It contradicts with (ii) part, which says 'SFJ shall pay PB'.

                "explanation": "Original says unanimous is required, changed text says PB's alone will be sufficient. PB retains authority over non-Section 5.2.2 matters, the modification enables PB's sole approval even where JSC's unanimous approval was initially needed. This creates uncertainty about the necessity of consent, as one section mandates approval from the JSC while the changed section permits unilateral action by PB. It sets the condition of 'the unanimous approval of the JSC will be required' against 'PB's approval will be sufficient'",

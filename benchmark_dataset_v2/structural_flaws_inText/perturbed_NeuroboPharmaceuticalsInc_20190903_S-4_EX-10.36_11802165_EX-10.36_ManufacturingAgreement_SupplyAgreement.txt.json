                "changed_text": "2.2 Dong-A shall ensure that the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), which are necessary to manufacture the Licensed Products, conform to the specifications outlined in Exhibit C (the \"API Specifications\"). NeuroBo bears no responsibility for the quality or delivery of API. 2.3 Dong-A shall, at its costs and expenses, deliver the API to NeuroBo for use in the Licensed Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates NeuroBo to supply API conforming to Exhibit C. The modified text shifts the responsibility of API supply and quality to Dong-A, directly contradicting the earlier requirement. This creates uncertainty about who is responsible for providing the crucial API.",

For each order, NeuroBo shall be obligated to order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in [***] tablets. NeuroBo acknowledges and agrees that certain quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo from each batch ordered shall be retained by Dong-A for use in the stability tests and as retention samples, and NeuroBo shall order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in consideration of such quantity to be retained by Dong-A. Each order shall specify at least (i) the quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (ii) the specifications of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, including the specifics of packaging, (iii) the expected delivery date for the API, (iv) the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (v) the shipment terms for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo and (vi) the supply price for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo. Upon receipt of the order from NeuroBo, Dong-A shall promptly acknowledge the receipt of such order. No order shall be binding upon the Parties until agreed in writing by Dong-A and NeuroBo; provided, however, that such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Upon such agreement, the order shall be deemed to be the \"Firm Order\" which shall be binding and may only be revised by agreement of the Parties in writing. Dong-A shall deliver the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to NeuroBo in accordance with the Firm Order on the shipment terms of [***] manufacturing facility of Dong-A (ICC Incoterms 2010), including the delivery date and place set forth therein, within the later of (i) [***] days after the date of the Firm Order and (ii) [***] days after the date of acceptance by Dong-A of the API.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 Dong-A shall determine the quantity of Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to be supplied to NeuroBo. NeuroBo is not required to submit any orders. Dong-A will provide Licensed Products as needed, based on their discretion. The specifics of packaging are at the sole discretion of Dong-A, with no input from NeuroBo. The Firm Order may be revised at any time by Dong-A without prior written consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that NeuroBo submits orders with specific quantities and specifications. The modified text states Dong-A determines the quantity, NeuroBo doesn't need to submit orders, and Dong-A controls packaging and revisions to the firm order. This completely reverses the defined order process, creating a direct contradiction and rendering the ordering process uncertain.",

NeuroBo shall provide Dong-A with all available information and technical assistance necessary for Dong-A to perform the API Test expeditiously. If the API Test indicates that the API is deficient in quantity or does not meet the API Specifications, Dong-A shall notify NeuroBo thereof in writing within the [***]-day period together with results of the API Test.

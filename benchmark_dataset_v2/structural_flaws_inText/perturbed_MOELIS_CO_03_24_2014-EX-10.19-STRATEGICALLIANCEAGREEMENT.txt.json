                "original_text": "3.5 Client. A \"Client\" is (i) with respect to SMBC/Nikko, a Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions that SMBC/Nikko Introduces to Moelis Holdings pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) with respect to Moelis Holdings, a Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions that Moelis Holdings Introduces to SMBC/Nikko pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "3.5 Client. A \"Client\" is (i) with respect to SMBC/Nikko, any person or entity within Covered Regions, regardless of origin, that SMBC/Nikko engages with for potential business and (ii) with respect to Moelis Holdings, only a Japanese Company within Covered Regions that Moelis Holdings Introduces to SMBC/Nikko pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Client' was reciprocal for both SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings, including both Japanese Companies and any other entity within Covered Regions. The revised definition now states that for SMBC/Nikko, a 'Client' can be any person or entity, regardless of origin, while for Moelis Holdings, it is specifically limited to Japanese Companies within Covered Regions. This creates a contradiction and ambiguity because the definition is inconsistent based on the party referencing it. This change could create disputes over fee allocations and the scope of non-solicitation clauses.",

This Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 2012 (the \"Effective Date\"), provided, however, that, ARTICLE XII and ARTICLE XIII shall not be effective until after the Closing. The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below. At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one (1) year term, unless a party provides written notice to the other parties at least six (6) months prior to the end of the initial term. At any time during a renewed term, this Agreement may be terminated by any party on six (6) months prior notice that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.",

This Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 2012 (the \"Effective Date\"), provided, however, that, ARTICLE XII and ARTICLE XIII shall not be effective until after the Closing.

                "explanation": "The original agreement specified a three-year initial term, subject to termination rights, and subsequent automatic one-year renewals. By changing the phrase \"continue for three (3) years\" to \"continue indefinitely,\" the contract now states it has an indefinite initial term, which directly contradicts the following sentence that describes automatic one-year renewals. This change introduces uncertainty about the duration of the agreement and the conditions for renewal.",

                "changed_text": "15.4 No Assignment. This Agreement may be freely assigned by any party to any entity, whether affiliated or unaffiliated, at any time, without the consent of any other party. This completely supersedes any conflicting provisions of the Moelis Holdings Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause prohibited assignment of the agreement without written consent, except for assignment to a subsidiary or controlled affiliate succeeding in Covered Businesses. This modification reverses that, stating that the agreement can be freely assigned to any entity without consent, and invalidates previous restrictions. This contradicts the implied understanding that consent is generally required for assignments, which undermines the control that parties have over who their contractual partners are.",

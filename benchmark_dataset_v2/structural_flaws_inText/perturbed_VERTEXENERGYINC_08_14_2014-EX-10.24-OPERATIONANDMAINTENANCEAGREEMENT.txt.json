Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement, Owner hereby authorizes and empowers Operator, and Operator agrees, in the name of and on behalf of Owner, to, at its sole cost and expense, keep and maintain the Rail Facility in a condition and repair similar to, but not less than, its condition and repair on the Effective Date hereof.",

Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement, Owner hereby authorizes and empowers Operator, and Operator agrees, in the name of and on behalf of Owner, to keep and maintain the Rail Facility. All costs and expenses associated with such maintenance will be borne solely by Owner.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the Operator will maintain the Rail Facility at its sole cost and expense. The modified clause states that the Owner will be responsible for all costs. This creates a direct contradiction concerning the financial responsibility for maintaining the facility, leading to uncertainty about which party is liable for maintenance costs.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that when the agreement is terminated by the Owner, the Owner may reimburse the Operator for any unamortized capital expenditure. The modified clause states that the Owner is not required to reimburse the Operator in the same event. This creates a direct contradiction and adds uncertainty about if the Operator will be reimbursed when the Owner terminates the contract.",

Operator shall not make any assignment of all or any part of this Agreement or any of the rights or obligations hereunder unless there first shall have been obtained the written consent thereto of Owner, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Owner shall not make any assignment of all or any part of this Agreement or any of the rights or obligations hereunder except in connection with the sale, financing or conveyance of all or any part of the Rail Facility.

Operator shall not make any assignment of all or any part of this Agreement or any of the rights or obligations hereunder unless there first shall have been obtained the written consent thereto of Owner, which consent may be withheld for any reason. Owner shall have the unfettered right to assign this agreement to any third party. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Parties. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement in violation of this Section 8.12 shall be valid.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the Owner's consent cannot be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The modified clause states that the Owner can withhold for any reason. Also, in the last sentence, the original clause states that any attempted assignment of this Agreement in violation of this Section 8.12 shall be null and void. The modified clause states the opposite where it is valid. This directly contradicts the previous agreement.",

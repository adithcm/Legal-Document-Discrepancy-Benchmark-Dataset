                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\"), unless mutually extended by written agreement of the Parties or unless sooner terminated as provided herein, shall commence effective as of the date hereof and shall expire on December 31, 2028.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\"), unless otherwise terminated, shall commence effective as of the date hereof and shall expire on December 31, 2028. However, Constellation reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time and for any reason with 30 days written notice to HOF Entities.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a contradiction to the 'Term' of the agreement. Section 4.1 initially states the agreement ends on a specific date. The added clause allows Constellation to terminate at will, undermining the fixed term. This creates uncertainty as HOF Entities can no longer rely on a contract that may be terminated at any time.",

                "explanation": "The initial paragraph mandates written notices delivered by courier, overnight delivery, or certified/registered mail. The added sentence suggests that email is an acceptable form of delivery, directly conflicting with the earlier stipulation that physical mail is required for valid notice. This creates an in-text contradiction as it is unclear whether a notice sent via email is legally valid or not.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'HOF Entities' to 'Constellation', the venue where lawsuits can be filed is now determined solely by Constellation, contradicting the original text that allowed HOF Entities to choose an appropriate venue. This change introduces uncertainty about the location of any legal proceedings related to the agreement, creating a structural flaw in which both parties are not aligned to where the case is heard.",

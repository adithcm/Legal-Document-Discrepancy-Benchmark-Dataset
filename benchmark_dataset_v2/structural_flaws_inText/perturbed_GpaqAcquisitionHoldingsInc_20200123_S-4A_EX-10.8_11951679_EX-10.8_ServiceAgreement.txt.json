Provided that Constellation is not then in breach of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.1 hereof, and provided that Constellation has available for purchase a product or service which meets the needs of the HOF Entities at competitive market pricing, (a) neither of the HOF Entities shall purchase, at any time during the Term, any commodity electricity or gas from any person or entity other than Constellation and its affiliates and (b) in the event and to the extent mutually agreed by the Parties, neither of the HOF Entities shall grant or award to any company designated by Constellation (and mutually agreeable to the HOF Entities) any project which the Parties mutually agree shall not be granted or awarded to such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 2.2 shall not be deemed to apply to agreements executed prior to the date of this Agreement between the HOF Entities and Johnson Controls, Inc. or any of its affiliates.",

This Section 2.2 shall not be deemed to apply to agreements executed prior to the date of this Agreement between the HOF Entities and Johnson Controls, Inc. or any of its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Constellation exclusivity, while the modified version allows the HOF Entities to purchase from other providers if they deem Constellation's pricing unfavorable. This creates an in-text contradiction because it is unclear whether Constellation has exclusivity or not.",

Annual Activation Funds are to be used in each calendar year. Unused funds are not rolled into future contract years. In the event Constellation fails to pay to the HOF Entities when due any sum required by this Agreement to be paid, whether pursuant to this Section 3.4 or otherwise, interest shall accrue from the date due on the unpaid amount at the rate of [***] per month or, if less, the highest rate permitted by law.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies unused funds are not rolled into future contract years, and interest shall accrue for late payments. The modified version contradicts this by saying funds *may* be rolled over at the discretion of HOF and interest *may or may not* accrue. This makes the payment terms ambiguous and unenforceable.",

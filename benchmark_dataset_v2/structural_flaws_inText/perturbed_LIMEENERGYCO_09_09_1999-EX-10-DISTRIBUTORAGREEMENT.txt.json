The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)\nyears (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date\nupon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the\nlast Sample, as defined  hereinafter.  If Distributor\ncomplies with all of the terms of this Agreement, the\nAgreement  shall be  renewable on an annual basis for\none (1) year terms for up to  another  ten (10) years\non the same terms and conditions as set forth herein.\nAll renewals of this  Agreement  shall be on the same\nterms and conditions as are set forth herein.",

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)\nyears (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date\nupon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the\nlast Sample, as defined  hereinafter. The agreement may be terminated at any time, with or without cause, by either party with thirty (30) days written notice. All renewals of this  Agreement  shall be on the same\nterms and conditions as are set forth herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a ten-year term with potential renewals. The modified text introduces a clause allowing either party to terminate the agreement at any time with 30 days' notice, effectively contradicting the fixed term and the renewal clause. This creates uncertainty about the duration of the agreement and the obligations of each party.",

Distributor will attempt to pay Company  within  thirty\n(30) days of   Distributor's or,  as  the  case  may  be,  the\nend-user's receipt of Products, contingent upon end user payment to the distributor. If end-user payments are delayed by reasons outside of the distributor's control, such as a force majeure event, the distributor is not required to pay the company until thirty days after the distributor receives payment from the end user. ",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates payment within 30 days. The modified clause introduces a contingency that payment is dependent on the distributor first receiving payment from the end-user, and the distributor is not required to pay if end user payment is delayed by a force majeure. This contradicts the original, strict 30-day payment term, creating confusion about when payment is actually due.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Subject to earlier termination as provided in this Agreement, the initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period beginning on the Effective Date and ending ten (10) years thereafter unless this Agreement is terminated earlier as provided herein. This Agreement will renew automatically thereafter for successive one-year terms unless and until one Party gives notification of termination with at least sixty (60) days written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to earlier termination as provided in this Agreement, the initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period beginning on the Effective Date and ending ten (10) years thereafter unless this Agreement is terminated earlier as provided herein. This Agreement will renew only upon written mutual agreement by both parties no less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement will automatically renew, unless terminated with 60 days' notice. The modified version changes this to require *explicit written agreement* for renewal, creating a direct contradiction about whether the agreement auto-renews or requires active consent.",

                "original_text": "All orders whether for Manufacturer's Products or components or inventory to be used in the manufacture of Manufacturer's Products are non-cancellable.",
                "changed_text": "All orders whether for Manufacturer's Products or components or inventory to be used in the manufacture of Manufacturer's Products are non-cancellable. However, Manufacturer may cancel any order with a 15% cancellation fee of the entire order value.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly says that all orders are non-cancellable, providing certainty to the supplier. By adding a sentence allowing cancellation with a fee, the modified version introduces a direct contradiction. The first sentence says 'non-cancellable,' while the second introduces an exception and a mechanism for cancellation, thus creating uncertainty about whether an order can truly be cancelled.",
                "location": "Section 8.1"
            },
            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Manufacturer shall be liable for cancellation charges including the Product Costs and the costs as provided in Section 3.8.",
                "changed_text": "Manufacturer shall be liable for cancellation charges including the Product Costs and the costs as provided in Section 3.8. However, in the event that cancellation is due to circumstances beyond the Manufacturer's control, such as a force majeure event affecting the Manufacturer, the Manufacturer shall not be liable for any cancellation charges, and Subcontractor shall bear all costs associated with the cancellation.",
                "explanation": "This creates ambiguity around liability. The original text states the manufacturer WILL be liable for cancellation charges. The modified text adds a caveat where they will NOT be, thus contradicting the initial assertion. This opens up the potential for disputes on what constitutes a force majeure event and therefore who is responsible for the charges.",

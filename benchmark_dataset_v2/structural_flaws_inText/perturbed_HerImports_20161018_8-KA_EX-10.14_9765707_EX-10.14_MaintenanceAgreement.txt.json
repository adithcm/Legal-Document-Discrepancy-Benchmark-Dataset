                "changed_text": "1. EXTENSION OF SERVICE AGREEMENT. Subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein, as of the date of this agreement, LEADER may maintain the software for an additional period as determined by EZJR.",
                "explanation": "The original text states LEADER 'maintain the software for an additional five years,' creating a firm obligation. The modified text changes 'maintain' to 'may maintain' and specifies that the duration is 'as determined by EZJR,' thereby removing LEADER's guaranteed right to the extension and giving EZJR sole discretion. This contradicts the original intent of a fixed five-year extension and creates uncertainty about LEADER's service period.",

The modified text adds 'each party shall bear its own attorney's fees regardless of the outcome.'

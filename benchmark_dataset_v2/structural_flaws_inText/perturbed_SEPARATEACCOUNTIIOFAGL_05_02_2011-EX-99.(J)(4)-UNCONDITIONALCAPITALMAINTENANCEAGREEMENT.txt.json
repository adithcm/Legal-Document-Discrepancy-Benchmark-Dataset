                "original_text": "AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that AIG agrees not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies the corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells the Company to an acquirer (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such sale. To the extent not terminated previously by AIG pursuant to the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate automatically one year after the closing of any sale of the Company by AIG, and all provisions hereof will be of no further force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph 8 shall not relieve either party of any obligation it may owe to the other party hereunder that existed prior to, and remains outstanding as of, the Termination Date.",

To the extent not terminated previously by AIG pursuant to the foregoing, this Agreement may be extended beyond one year after the closing of any sale of the Company by AIG if both parties agree in writing, and all provisions hereof will remain in full force and effect until terminated by either party with 30 days written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph 8 shall not relieve either party of any obligation it may owe to the other party hereunder that existed prior to, and remains outstanding as of, the Termination Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text gave AIG an \"absolute right\" to terminate with conditions, but then specified automatic termination one year after the sale of the company. The modified text removes the \"absolute right\", making the right contingent, and introduces a contradiction by stating that the agreement may be extended beyond the one-year period post-sale if both parties agree. This creates uncertainty about the actual term and termination conditions of the agreement.",

It being understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after the Termination Date, such policyholder may have rights against the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 9.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states policyholder rights terminate after the termination date. The modification introduces a contradiction by adding that, with the Domiciliary State approval, some policyholders may still enforce the agreement post-termination. It also introduces ambiguity by suggesting that after AIG fulfills its prior obligations, policyholders \"may\" have rights. This contradicts the initial statement about termination of rights and creates uncertainty regarding the conditions under which a policyholder could pursue claims after the agreement's end.",

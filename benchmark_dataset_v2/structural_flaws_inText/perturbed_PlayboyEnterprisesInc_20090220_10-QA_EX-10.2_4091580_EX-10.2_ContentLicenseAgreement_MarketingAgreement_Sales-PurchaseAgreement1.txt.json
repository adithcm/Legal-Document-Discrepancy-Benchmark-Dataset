This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated as provided under  this Agreement, shall terminate five (5) years following the date of launch of the first Website, but in no event later than February  28, 2013 (the \"Initial Term\").

                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement *automatically* renews if EFS hits a sales target. The changed text says it *may* renew only if both parties agree, making the renewal discretionary and contradicting the automatic renewal clause. This creates uncertainty as to whether EFS hitting its sales goals *guarantees* a renewal or if it's merely a condition for further negotiation.",

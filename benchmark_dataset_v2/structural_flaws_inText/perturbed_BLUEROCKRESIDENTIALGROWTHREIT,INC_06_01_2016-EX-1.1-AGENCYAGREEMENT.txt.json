The modified text adds a sentence authorizing the entities to declare dividends \"at their discretion regardless of material impact or amount.\" This directly contradicts part (A) by implying that even if a material adverse change *does* occur, the entities can still distribute dividends, potentially exacerbating the adverse effect.

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Invention' is broad and includes ideas whether or not patentable. The modified definition limits it to only those that are patentable, copyrightable, protectable, reduced to practice and memorialized. This contradiction introduces ambiguity as to what qualifies as an 'Invention' under the agreement, which can create uncertainty in intellectual property ownership and rights.",

(a) Inventorship of all Inventions developed by either Party, or both Parties, in the performance of the R&D Program, shall be determined in accordance with the inventorship laws of the United States, even to the extent such Invention is not pursued in patent applications.",

(a) Inventorship of all Inventions developed by either Party, or both Parties, in the performance of the R&D Program, shall be determined solely at Stryker's discretion, regardless of the inventorship laws of the United States or whether such Invention is pursued in patent applications.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that inventorship is determined by US inventorship laws. The modified version allows Stryker to determine inventorship at its sole discretion, overriding the inventorship laws of the United States. This creates a conflict in how inventorship is determined, potentially leading to disputes over IP ownership.",

Except as otherwise provided herein, a Party shall not have the right to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether through a merger, sale of stock, or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party; except that, either Party shall be permitted, without any need for the other Party's consent, to assign this Agreement (a) in whole or in part to an Affiliate (provided, however, that once such Person is no longer an Affiliate of the assigning Party, such former Affiliate shall assign this Agreement back to the assigning Party), provided that the assigning Party provides the other Party notice of any such assignment provided further that failure to provide such notice of such assignment shall not render such assignment void; or (b) to a Third Party in connection with sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assigning Party's business or assets relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether by Change of Control, merger, sale of assets or otherwise; provided, however, that, with respect to clause (b), (i) any assignment of this Agreement shall be void and have no effect unless and until the assignee assumes the obligations of the assigning Party in a written instrument, a copy of which is provided to the other Party; and (ii) any assignment of this Agreement must be accompanied by a simultaneous assignment of the Other Agreements to the same assignee, and the assigning Party's interest in the Purchased Assets to the same assignee unless otherwise agreed by Conformis in advance, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any assignment in whole or in part shall not relieve the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder. If and to the extent that a Party assigns any of its rights and/or obligations hereunder in accordance with this Section 10.2, then this Agreement shall be binding upon the assignee to the same extent as if it were a Party hereto. Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 10.2 shall be void.",
                "changed_text": "10.2 Assignment and Change of Control. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Stryker shall have the unrestricted right to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, at any time, to any party, without notice or consent from Conformis. Conformis's rights to assignment remain as originally stated. Any assignment in whole or in part shall relieve the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder only if the assignee agrees to fulfill such obligations. If and to the extent that Stryker assigns any of its rights and/or obligations hereunder in accordance with this Section 10.2, then this Agreement shall be binding upon the assignee to the same extent as if it were a Party hereto. Any assignment not in accordance with Conformis's rights in this Section 10.2 shall be void.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires mutual consent for assignment except in specific cases like assignment to an affiliate. The modified text allows Stryker unrestricted assignment without Conformis's consent. This directly contradicts the opening statement of the original clause, creating significant uncertainty and imbalance in assignment rights and gives Stryker an unfair advantage.",

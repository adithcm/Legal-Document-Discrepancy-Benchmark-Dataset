                "original_text": "This agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement shall remain in full force and effect for a period of one year, automatically renewing for successive one-year terms, unless revoked by unanimous agreement of all parties involved. Revocation requires a signed writing delivered to all parties, and such revocation will be effective immediately for all parties.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states that any party can revoke the agreement individually. The modified version contradicts this by stating that revocation requires unanimous agreement from all parties. This creates uncertainty regarding the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated, shifting the power dynamic and potentially leading to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), each party agrees to consider joint filings under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The decision to jointly file remains at the sole discretion of each party, and this agreement does not mandate joint filing but suggests a collaborative approach where feasible. Individual filings are permitted and will not be considered a breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a joint filing. The modified text contradicts this by stating that the decision to jointly file is at each party's sole discretion. This creates uncertainty about the obligation to file jointly, potentially leading to disputes over whether individual filings are permissible under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original states the agreement is effective as of the date set forth. The change delays the effective date of the contract, contradicting the initial statement and creating uncertainty about the point at which the agreement is legally binding. This means that while the agreement states a specific effective date, it's conditional, allowing parties to withdraw beforehand.",

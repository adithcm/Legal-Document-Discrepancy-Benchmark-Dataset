                "changed_text": "Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof. The duration of this license will be determined on a yearly basis, with renewals subject to Honeywell's approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a 'perpetual' license, meaning it lasts forever. The modified version introduces a yearly renewal process subject to Honeywell's approval, directly contradicting the 'perpetual' term. This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the license and the obligations of both parties, especially SpinCo's reliance on the licensed IP.",

Such determination will be made at Honeywell's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text restricts Honeywell from taking certain actions against SpinCo's IP for five years, provided SpinCo's use is consistent with pre-distribution practices. The modified version adds a caveat that Honeywell can disregard these restrictions if SpinCo takes any action deemed 'detrimental' to Honeywell's interests, as determined solely by Honeywell. This contradicts the initial restriction, creating uncertainty about when Honeywell is bound by the agreement and potentially allowing them to circumvent the agreement at will.",

However, in the event that either Honeywell or SpinCo files for bankruptcy, all licenses granted to the other party shall immediately terminate.",
                "explanation": "Section 11.10 initially ensures that bankruptcy proceedings don't automatically terminate IP licenses. The added sentence directly contradicts this by stipulating that a bankruptcy filing immediately terminates all licenses granted to the other party. This creates a direct conflict within the same section, making it unclear whether licenses survive bankruptcy or not.",

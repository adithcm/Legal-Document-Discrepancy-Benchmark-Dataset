                "explanation": "The original text allows for termination by mutual agreement, distributor convenience, and Zogenix convenience under specified conditions. The modified version explicitly states mutual agreement is the *only* way to terminate, contradicting the subsequent sections that discuss termination by distributor or Zogenix convenience. This creates uncertainty about whether distributor and Zogenix can unilaterally terminate the agreement. Additionally, the negation of the other two sections exacerbates the conflicting conditions, leaving both parties unsure about their termination rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Indirect Losses' and Section 10.5 limits the recovery of certain types of damages (special, incidental, consequential, punitive), except for breaches of Article 8 or indemnification obligations. The modified text adds to definition 1.33 'This includes every type of loss or damage that may arise from this agreement.' and to section 10.5 'No party is limited in the type, value, or quantity of loss or damage they are responsible for.' This creates a contradiction: are such losses recoverable or not? The new sentence directly contradicts the limitation of liability stated in Section 10.5, making the enforceability of the limitation unclear.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding who controls and pays for patent prosecution. The original clause states that Zogenix has sole discretion and bears the cost. The modified clause transfers this discretion and cost to the Distributor. Further the clause makes no effort to protect these patents. This creates confusion about which party is responsible for patent upkeep and whether there is even a requirement to do so.",

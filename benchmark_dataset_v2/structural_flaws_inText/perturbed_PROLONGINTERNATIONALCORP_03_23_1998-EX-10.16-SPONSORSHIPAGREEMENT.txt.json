                "changed_text": "For the duration of this agreement, Sabco reserves the right to substitute or replace any of the aforementioned drivers listed; however, Sabco shall make reasonable efforts to provide Prolong with prior notice of any such substitution or replacement, and shall obtain Prolong's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives Sabco unilateral right to change drivers. The modified text now states that Sabco should provide notice and get Prolong's approval. This creates a conflict as it is now unclear if Sabco can unilaterally change the driver.",

Prolong shall be responsible for all first class travel expenses relating to each driver appearance, i.e. hotel, airfare, meals, etc.  Additional appearances by Sabco drivers shall be at the discounted rate of [ * ] ($[ * ]) Dollars per day per driver, [ * ].",

Prolong shall be responsible for travel expenses as negotiated separately for each appearance. Additional appearances by Sabco drivers may be available at a rate to be determined by Sabco, and is subject to driver availability.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that each of the five free driver appearances will be two-hours each. The modified text removes this guarantee, stating that the duration of each appearance will be determined at Sabco's discretion, which contradicts the initial agreement. Further, it creates ambiguity around expenses.",

                "explanation": "The original text is a clear exclusivity clause. The modified text weakens this clause by adding 'good faith efforts' and 'directly and substantially competitive', making it subjective. The inclusion of 'Sabco's decision is final' further undermines the original exclusivity, and makes enforcement uncertain.",

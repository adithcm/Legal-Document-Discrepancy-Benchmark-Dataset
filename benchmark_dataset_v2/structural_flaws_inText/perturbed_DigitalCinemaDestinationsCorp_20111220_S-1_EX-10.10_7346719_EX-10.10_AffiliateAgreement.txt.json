Unless earlier terminated as provided below, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\") after which this Agreement may be extended on mutual agreement of the parties (a \"Renewal Term,\" and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\"). If either party wishes to extend the Initial Term it shall provide notice to the other not later than 180 days, nor sooner than 270 days, before the end of the Initial Term.

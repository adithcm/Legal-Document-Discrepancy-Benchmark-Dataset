                "original_text": "1.1.1   Upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, Party A hereby agrees to grant and Party B hereby agree to accept the right to use the intellectual property in PRC. The license under this Agreement is a non-exclusive, non-assignable and non-transferable license.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.1   Upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, Party A hereby agrees to grant and Party B hereby agree to accept the right to use the intellectual property in PRC. The license under this Agreement is a non-exclusive license; however, it may be assigned or transferred with the written consent of both parties.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause by stating the license is 'non-assignable and non-transferable' but then introduces the possibility of assignment or transfer with written consent. This creates uncertainty about whether the license can actually be assigned or transferred.",

The term of this Agreement is five (5) years unless the early termination in accordance with this Agreement. However, Party A and Party B shall review this Agreement every six (6) months to determine whether any amendment or supplement to the Agreement is necessary by considering the circumstances after the executing of this Agreement.",

The term of this Agreement is five (5) years unless the early termination in accordance with this Agreement. However, Party A alone shall review this Agreement every six (6) months to determine whether any amendment or supplement to the Agreement is necessary by considering the circumstances after the executing of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that both Party A and Party B shall review the agreement. The modified version states that only Party A shall review the agreement. This contradiction creates uncertainty about each party's role in the periodic review process and whether both parties have equal input regarding amendments or supplements.",

Party B shall pay the license fee to the account designated by Party A before December 31 each year. Party A has the right to determine whether or not to exempt the Party B's obligation to pay license fee at its discretion.",

Party B shall pay the license fee to the account designated by Party A before December 31 each year. Party B has the right to request a waiver of the Party B's obligation to pay license fee at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states Party A has the right to exempt fees; the modified clause gives Party B the right to request that the fees be waived. This shifts the power regarding fee waiving from Party A to Party B, but without removing the original clause, so creates contradiction about who has the ultimate decision-making power on waiving fees.",

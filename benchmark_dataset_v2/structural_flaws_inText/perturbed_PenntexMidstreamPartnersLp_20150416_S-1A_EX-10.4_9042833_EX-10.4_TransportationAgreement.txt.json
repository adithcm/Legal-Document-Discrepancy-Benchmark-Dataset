                "original_text": "\"Firm Service\" shall mean service for which Transporter is contractually entitled to interrupt its performance only to the extent (i) that such performance is excused pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement relating to Force Majeure, (ii) of specified periods of maintenance, or (iii) that Transporter determines that the operation of all or any portion of its facilities will cause injury or harm to persons or property or to the integrity of its facilities, and with respect to each of (i), (ii) or (iii), only to the extent that Transporter has curtailed all service of the same priority on a pro rata basis in accordance with Article V.",
                "changed_text": "\"Firm Service\" shall mean service for which Transporter is contractually entitled to interrupt its performance at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice to the Customer. The Transporter is not required to curtail other services prior to interrupting Firm Service.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Firm Service provides limited conditions under which interruption is permissible. The modified definition contradicts this by stating the Transporter can interrupt at any time for any reason, removing the pro rata curtailment requirement.",

During the Term, subject to the terms of the AMI/MEA Agreement, Customer dedicates and commits to this Agreement, and shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Transportation System for transportation hereunder, all of Customer's owned or controlled residue Gas delivered from any of the Plants. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that there is no minimum amount of residue Gas that must be delivered to the Transportation System hereunder; accordingly, Customer shall not have any liability (financial or otherwise) for failure to deliver any particular quantity of residue Gas to Transporter; provided, however, the foregoing sentence shall not reduce or eliminate Customer's obligation to pay the fees provided herein to the extent Services are provided hereunder.",

During the Term, subject to the terms of the AMI/MEA Agreement, Customer dedicates and commits to this Agreement, but Customer may elect to deliver residue Gas to other transportation systems at its sole discretion. The Customer shall have no obligation to deliver any Gas to the Transportation system. If customer doesn't deliver any Gas, Customer doesn't have to pay any fees.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires Customer to deliver all residue Gas but specifies no liability for *quantity* failures, provided fees are paid for services *provided*. The revised version states Customer can deliver Gas to other systems, and faces no liability if Customer doesn't deliver any Gas to the Transporter. Moreover, the modified version states that if Customer doesn't deliver any Gas, Customer doesn't have to pay any fees, contradicting the last line of original text.",

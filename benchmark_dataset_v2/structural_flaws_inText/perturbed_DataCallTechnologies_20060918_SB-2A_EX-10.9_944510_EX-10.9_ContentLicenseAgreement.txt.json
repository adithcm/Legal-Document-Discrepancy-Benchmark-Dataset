The Initial Term shall automatically be           extended  for  an additional period of half a year unless either party           provides  the  other party with written notification of termination of           the  letter  Agreement  at  least 60 days prior to end of such period.",

The modified version states that the contract may be extended at the sole discretion of plan_b with no notification required. This introduces a contradiction as it removes Licensor's right to prevent the extension and creates uncertainty around the term's actual length.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states neither party can assign the agreement without consent. The modified clause states Licensor needs plan_b's consent, but plan_b does not need Licensor's consent, creating an imbalance of power and contradictory obligations.",

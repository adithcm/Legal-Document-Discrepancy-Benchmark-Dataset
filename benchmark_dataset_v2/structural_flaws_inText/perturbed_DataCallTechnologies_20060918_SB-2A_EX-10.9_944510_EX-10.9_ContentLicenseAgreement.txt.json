Additionally, Licensee shall have the right to use the trademarks, trade names, or logos relating to Content (the \"TRADEMARKS\").",
                "changed_text": "5.3 LICENSOR grants to plan_b a license to produce, use, distribute, promote and publicly display the Content in any possible way for distribution and marketing purposes. However, the specific methods and extent of distribution shall be subject to Licensor's prior written approval. Additionally, Licensee shall have the right to use the trademarks, trade names, or logos relating to Content (the \"TRADEMARKS\"), but this right is revocable at any time by Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants plan_b a broad license to use and distribute content. The changed text introduces restrictions by requiring Licensor's approval for distribution methods and making trademark usage revocable. This creates a contradiction: plan_b has a seemingly broad license, but its practical use is now uncertain and dependent on Licensor's discretion. This uncertainty could lead to disputes over distribution rights and trademark usage.",

The Initial Term shall automatically be extended for an additional period of half a year unless either party provides the other party with written notification of termination of the letter Agreement at least 60 days prior to end of such period.",

The Initial Term may be extended for an additional period of half a year if both parties verbally agree to the extension 30 days prior to end of such period.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic renewal unless a written termination notice is provided 60 days before the end of the initial term. The modified version removes the automatic extension and requires verbal agreement, 30 days prior. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the renewal process, creating ambiguity. It becomes unclear whether the contract automatically extends, requires written notice to terminate, or if a verbal agreement is sufficient for extension, thus allowing either party to claim the contract is or isn't extended.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that plan_b shall pay LICENSOR a share of its revenues, with no mention of marketing or promotional expenses. The modified version adds that Licensor is responsible for marketing and promotional costs and this cost will be deducted from the revenues. This creates a contradiction in that while plan_b owes Licensor revenues, the actual amount received is now uncertain and depends on expenses covered by the Licensor, which isn't specified within the agreement, potentially leading to disputes regarding payment amounts and the allocation of these costs.",

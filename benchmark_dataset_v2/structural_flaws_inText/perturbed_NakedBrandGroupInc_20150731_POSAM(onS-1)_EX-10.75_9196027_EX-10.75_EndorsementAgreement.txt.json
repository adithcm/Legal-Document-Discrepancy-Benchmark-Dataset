In the absence of disapproval within three (3) business days of Wade's or  authorized agent's receipt of a request for approval, said advertising or promotional material shall be deemed approved. Any such usage featuring Athlete shall be and remain the property of Naked except as otherwise set forth herein; however, Naked shall have the right to such use only during the Term.

Naked agrees to submit to Wade or its authorized agent a copy of all new promotional and/or advertising material using Wade Image at least ten (10) days prior to the release to the general public. Wade and its authorized agent retain the right to arbitrarily withhold such approval, regardless of reason. In the absence of disapproval within three (3) business days of Wade's or  authorized agent's receipt of a request for approval, said advertising or promotional material shall be deemed approved, unless Wade subsequently revokes said approval within 24 hours. Any such usage featuring Athlete shall be and remain the property of Naked except as otherwise set forth herein; however, Naked shall have the right to such use only during the Term, unless Wade requests Naked to cease using any and all promotional materials using Wade’s image before the term is up.

                "explanation": "This change introduces contradictory terms regarding the use of Wade's image. The original text stipulates that Wade's approval should not be unreasonably withheld. The modified version introduces loopholes that allow Wade to arbitrarily withhold approval, revoke approvals after they've been given, and demand the cessation of promotional materials before the end of the term. It also introduces the concept of compensation for Wade’s time and effort, which was not in the original agreement. This creates confusion about the approval process and Naked's rights to use Wade's image, increasing the risk of disputes and uncertainty in enforcement.",

Such termination shall relieve Naked of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement provided that Wade shall retain all warrants he has received hereunder that have vested as of the date of such termination. In the event of such termination as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by Wade (i) Wade's contractual liabilities and obligations until the date of termination still exist notwithstanding such termination, (ii)  Naked shall be under no obligation to sell any Wade Products but shall nevertheless owe the Royalty on any Wade Products sold; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Wade shall forfeit all warrants he has received hereunder. Naked shall not have waived any of its rights at law or in equity by exercising any provision of this section.",
                "changed_text": "Naked shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Wade in the event Wade fails to perform the Wade Services or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the essence of this Agreement), and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice. Such termination may relieve Naked of its obligation to provide any further consideration pursuant to this Agreement, pending a review of Wade’s actions leading up to the termination, and Wade may retain all warrants he has received hereunder that have vested as of the date of such termination, unless Naked determines that Wade’s actions leading up to the breach were egregious. In the event of such termination as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by Wade (i) Wade's contractual liabilities and obligations until the date of termination still exist notwithstanding such termination, (ii)  Naked shall be under no obligation to sell any Wade Products but shall nevertheless owe the Royalty on any Wade Products sold, but Naked may reclaim any royalties paid within the last year, and (iii) Wade may forfeit all warrants he has received hereunder, at Naked's discretion. Naked shall not have waived any of its rights at law or in equity by exercising any provision of this section.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and contradictions into the termination clause. The original text is relatively clear: if Wade materially breaches, Naked can terminate and Wade forfeits warrants. The modified version adds uncertainty by making Naked's obligation to provide further consideration 'pending a review,' allowing Naked to reclaim royalties paid within the last year, and making the forfeiture of warrants subject to 'Naked's discretion.' This creates an in-text contradiction because Naked can retroactively nullify payments that would have previously vested, and makes the consequences of Wade's breach unclear. The additional phrases inject uncertainty and could allow Naked to behave opportunistically, leading to potential disputes.",

During the Term and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Wade Team and Naked agree that the process for approving designs for Wade Products will be as follows:\n\n(1) Naked will develop detailed designs for each Wade Product, which shall include rough drawings, to be provided to Wade for review and comment;\n\n(2) The Wade Team will provide Naked with comments on such designs within ten (10) days after they are provided to the Wade Team;\n\n(3) Upon receipt of the Wade Team's comments, Naked will review such comments and work diligently to incorporate them into the design within commercial reason and thereafter, develop and create a prototype for such Wade Product for the Wade Team's approval;\n\n(4) Within ten (10) days after the Wade Team's receipt of the prototype either in hand or via a photograph by email, the Wade Team shall review the prototype and provide any additional comments; and\n\n(5) Upon the Wade Team's written approval of a prototype, such Wade Product will be considered approved for production (the \"Production Approval\").",
                "changed_text": "Athlete may have the title of \"Creative Director\" for the Wade Products, but Naked maintains full creative control, and the title does not imply any final say on design. The title may be featured on the Commercial Materials, or may not be, based on Naked's internal marketing strategy. During the Term and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Wade Team and Naked agree that the process for providing feedback on designs for Wade Products, if any, will be as follows:\n\n(1) Naked may, at its sole discretion, develop detailed designs for each Wade Product, which may include rough drawings, and may provide these to Wade for optional review and comment;\n\n(2) If the Wade Team chooses to provide Naked with comments on such designs, they must do so within ten (10) days after the designs were sent, if sent at all, otherwise the design will be considered pre-approved;\n\n(3) Upon receipt of the Wade Team's comments, Naked may review such comments at its discretion, but is under no obligation to incorporate them into the design. Naked may or may not develop and create a prototype for such Wade Product for the Wade Team's approval, as resources and strategy allow;\n\n(4) If the Wade Team receives a prototype from Naked, either in hand or via a photograph by email, the Wade Team may review the prototype and provide any additional comments. If Wade fails to give those additional comments within 10 days of receipt, Naked has full rights to assume those designs are perfect; and\n\n(5) Upon Naked's internal approval of a prototype, such Wade Product will be considered approved for production (the \"Production Approval\"), regardless of the Wade Team's feedback.",
                "explanation": "This change undermines Wade's role as 'Creative Director' and introduces contradiction by making his involvement in the design process optional and subject to Naked's discretion. While the original text establishes a collaborative process with specific steps, the modified version gives Naked complete control, rendering Wade's input essentially advisory and non-binding. The clause stipulating 'Upon Naked's internal approval...such Wade Product will be considered approved for production' directly contradicts the spirit of a 'Creative Director' role and implies that Wade's approval is not actually necessary, leading to possible disputes over creative control and the quality/marketability of the Wade Products.",

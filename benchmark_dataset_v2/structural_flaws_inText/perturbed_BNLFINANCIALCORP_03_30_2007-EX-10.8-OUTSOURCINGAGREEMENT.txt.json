BNL further acknowledges that there will also be unscheduled down-time that might occur as a result of electrical power failures and equipment failures and other acts outside of the control of VIP as contemplated in paragraph 16(J). In the event that any such down-time extends for more than two (2) consecutive working days, VIP, at its expense, will make available to BNL access to a backup facility designated by VIP for the continued processing of BNL's business.

BNL acknowledges that there will also be unscheduled down-time that might occur as a result of electrical power failures and equipment failures and other acts outside of the control of VIP as contemplated in paragraph 16(J). In the event that any such down-time extends for more than five (5) consecutive working days, VIP, at its discretion, will make available to BNL access to a backup facility, if available, designated by VIP for the continued processing of BNL's business. To ensure that a backup facility will be available in",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'reasonable' advance notice, implying an objective standard. Changing this to 'what VIP considers reasonable' introduces subjectivity and favors VIP's interpretation. Similarly, changing two to five days is contradictory. Further, changing 'at its expense' to 'at its discretion' introduces uncertainty regarding who bears the cost, and adding 'if available' makes the provision of a backup facility conditional, weakening VIP's obligation. This contradiction creates enforcement challenges.",

Subject to paragraphs 4(F) and (G), VIP agrees to make the same effort to safeguard such BNL Data as it does in protecting its own proprietary information. BNL Data will not be utilized by VIP for any purpose other than those purposes related to rendering EDP Services to BNL under this Agreement, nor will BNL Data or any part thereof be disclosed to third parties by VIP , its employees or agents except for purposes related to VIP's rendering ofEDP Services to BNL under this Agreement or as required by law, regulation, or  order of a court or regulatory agency or other authority having jurisdiction thereover.",

Subject to paragraphs 4(F) and (G), VIP will use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard such BNL Data. BNL Data may be utilized by VIP for purposes beyond those related to rendering EDP Services to BNL under this Agreement, including but not limited to improving VIP's service offerings. BNL Data or any part thereof may be disclosed to third parties by VIP , its employees or agents for purposes related to VIP's rendering of EDP Services to other clients or as deemed necessary by VIP.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the return of BNL Data upon termination. The modified text makes this return subject to VIP's internal policies, potentially conflicting with BNL's ownership rights. Changing the standard of care from 'same effort' to 'commercially reasonable efforts' weakens VIP's obligation. Allowing VIP to use BNL Data for purposes beyond the agreement and disclosing it to third parties contradicts the original confidentiality provisions and creates uncertainty about data security. This shift introduces significant ambiguity regarding data control and ownership.",

Payments under this Agreement by BNL shall commence as provided in paragraph 5(A) hereof. Unless either party gives written notice to terminate this Agreement at least six (6) months prior to the end of said Initial Term, this Agreement shall continue on a year to year basis (\"Extended Term(s)\") until terminated by either party by giving written notice of termination thereof to the other party at least six (6) months prior to the end of the then current Extended Term.",

Payments under this Agreement by BNL shall commence as provided in paragraph 5(A) hereof. Unless either party gives written notice to terminate this Agreement at least six (6) months prior to the end of said Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year periods (\"Extended Term(s)\") without the need for any further action by either party, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires a six-month notice for termination, implying a degree of control for both parties. Changing 'until terminated by either party' to 'shall automatically renew' directly contradicts the initial condition. The addition of 'unless otherwise agreed upon in writing' introduces an exception that undermines the six-month notice and adds potential for dispute over what constitutes an agreement. This creates significant confusion about the terms of renewal and termination.",

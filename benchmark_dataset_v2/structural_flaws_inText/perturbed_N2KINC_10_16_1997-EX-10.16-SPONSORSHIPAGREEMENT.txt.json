Excite and Sponsor acknowledge that                  certain market opportunities may arise in which the desired                  Music Products must be made available on less than thirty (30)                  days advance notice and will work together in good faith to                  maximize those opportunities. In no event will Excite enter                  into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase                  Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would                  prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source of such Music                  Products on the Excite Site once the Music Products become                  available through Sponsor.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Excite will not permit advertising by any other Retail Music Store and may make available opportunities to purchase Music Products from parties other than Sponsor if such Music Products are not available from Sponsor. In contrast, the modified text contradicts this exclusivity and notification requirement. It allows Excite to make such opportunities available even if the products are available from Sponsor and states that Excite is not obligated to notify the sponsor about any new parties before entering into arrangements to purchase music products, destroying the exclusivity agreement. The last statement also contradicts the original text, where it states that Excite will not enter into arrangements that would prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source, but is now stating that Excite has the sole right to make available opportunities to purchase Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly delineates data ownership: Excite owns data from its site, Sponsor owns data from its site (excluding referred users), and Co-Branded Page data is jointly owned. The modification changes the data ownership of the Sponsor's Site and Co-Branded Pages to be solely owned by Excite. This directly contradicts the original agreement and gives Excite complete control over all user data, regardless of the site of origin. This also creates uncertainty because the next sentence states that the jointly owned data will be held in confidence and not used except in accordance with reasonable guidelines, but since the data from the Co-Branded Pages is no longer jointly owned, that agreement no longer applies.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for both parties to protect each other's confidential information. The change now implies that either party can disclose confidential information to any third party, contradicting the entire purpose of the confidentiality clause. Secondly, the original says that it will take all reasonable measures to maintain confidentiality, which will be no less than the measures it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own information. Now it can use less measures. This creates uncertainty and weakens the protection of confidential information.",

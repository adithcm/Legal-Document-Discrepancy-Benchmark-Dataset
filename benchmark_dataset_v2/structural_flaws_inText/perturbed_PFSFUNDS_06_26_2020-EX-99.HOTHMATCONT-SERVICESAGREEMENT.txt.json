                "original_text": "6. Compensation. For the performance of the Adviser's obligations under this Agreement, including payment of certain expenses of each of the Funds pursuant to paragraph 3 hereof, each Fund shall pay the Adviser, on the first business day following the end of each month, a fee at an annual rate of 0.65% of a Fund's average daily net assets up to $25 million, 0.35% of a Fund's average daily net assets from $25 million to $100 million, and 0.25% of a Fund's average daily net assets for such assets in excess of $100 million.",
                "changed_text": "6. Compensation. For the performance of the Adviser's obligations under this Agreement, including payment of certain expenses of each of the Funds pursuant to paragraph 3 hereof, each Fund *may* pay the Adviser, on the first business day following the end of each month, a fee at an annual rate *up to* 0.65% of a Fund's average daily net assets up to $25 million, *up to* 0.35% of a Fund's average daily net assets from $25 million to $100 million, and *up to* 0.25% of a Fund's average daily net assets for such assets in excess of $100 million. The precise fee amount will be determined by the Trust's board of trustees at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that fees 'shall' be paid at a specific rate. The modified version replaces 'shall' with 'may' and introduces 'up to', giving the Trust discretion over whether to pay the fee and the fee amount, contradicting the original obligation. This creates uncertainty regarding the Adviser's compensation.",

This Services Agreement shall continue in effect from year to year thereafter, subject to termination as hereinafter provided, if such continuance is approved at least annually by vote of a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust or the Adviser. This Agreement may be terminated without the payment of any penalty by either party upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party. Upon the termination of this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser such compensation as may be payable for the period prior to the effective date of such termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event the Management Agreement is assigned or otherwise terminated.",

The term of this Services Agreement shall begin on the date of execution and shall continue in effect indefinitely, unless terminated as hereinafter provided. This Services Agreement may be terminated with a 30-day written notice by the trust and 90 days written notice by the Adviser. In the event of termination by the Trust, there will be no penalty except Trust will pay the Advisor for 3 months, and the agreement shall automatically terminate in the event the Management Agreement is assigned or otherwise terminated.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a two-year initial term with annual renewal options, and a 60-day written notice period for termination without penalty. The modified version changes the initial term to 'indefinitely', alters the notice periods, making it 30 days for Trust and 90 Days for the Adviser, and includes penalty. These changes directly contradict the originally stated terms, causing confusion as to the contract's duration and conditions for termination and associated costs.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Adviser is not liable except in cases of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. The modified text adds that even in those cases, they are not liable, directly contradicting the original exception. Additionally, it negates the agreement to defend and indemnify the Trust in case of inaccurate statements, creating a contradiction about liability for prospectus information.",

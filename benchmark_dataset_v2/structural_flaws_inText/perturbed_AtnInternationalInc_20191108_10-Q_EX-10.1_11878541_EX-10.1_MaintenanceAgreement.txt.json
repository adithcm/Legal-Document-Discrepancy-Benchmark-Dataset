Deliverables include, but are not limited to, any cell site configuration files, reports, data, designs, plans, specifications, models, prototypes, performance requirements, and/or Documentation delivered pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n2.13 Delivery or Completion. \"Delivery\" or \"Completion\" or any similar terms mean Vendor's obligation to provide Material and Services that strictly conform to the Specifications, including, without limitation, Location Acceptance of the Cell Sites described in the Build Addendum. Vendor completes Delivery of Material or Completion of Services: (i) in the case of any Cell Site (and all Material and Services incorporated therein or related thereto) upon Location Acceptance, and (ii) in the case of delivery of Material or Services that are required to be delivered prior to or following Location Acceptance, (A) upon AT&T's possession of the Material if Vendor is not required to provide additional Services, such as installation, (B) upon completing such additional Services, if Vendor is required to provide such Services in connection with providing Material, or (C) for Services, upon completing the provision of Services.

Deliverables include only some of cell site configuration files, reports, data, designs, plans, specifications, models, prototypes, performance requirements, and/or Documentation delivered pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n2.13 Delivery or Completion. \"Delivery\" or \"Completion\" or any similar terms mean Vendor's obligation to provide Material and Services that may not strictly conform to the Specifications, not including, without limitation, Location Acceptance of the Cell Sites described in the Build Addendum.

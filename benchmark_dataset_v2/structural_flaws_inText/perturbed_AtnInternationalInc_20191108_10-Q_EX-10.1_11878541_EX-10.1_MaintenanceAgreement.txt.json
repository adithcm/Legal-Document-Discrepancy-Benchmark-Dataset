                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Services' encompasses all services outlined in the Build and Maintenance Addenda.

                "explanation": "By changing \"all\" to \"some\" for Build Out and OEM specifications, and \"all\" to \"none\" for Maintenance Addendum specifications, the contract introduces ambiguity about which specific specifications are binding.

                "explanation": "The original sentence establishes a strict requirement for Material and Services to conform to the Specifications. The modified version negates this requirement, indicating that conformance is optional and only applies to some specifications. This creates a contradiction that undermines the enforceability of the Specifications, making it unclear what standards Vendor must adhere to and what recourse AT&T has if those standards are not met.",

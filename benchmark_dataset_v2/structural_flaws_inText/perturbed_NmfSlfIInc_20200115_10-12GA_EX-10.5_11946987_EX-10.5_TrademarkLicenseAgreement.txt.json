Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion. All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee may use the Licensed Mark to the extent they deem necessary, and the Licensee, including its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents, may use derivatives of the Licensed Mark without the need for consent from the Licensor. All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards in any material respect, the Licensee is not obligated to alter its usage of the Licensed Mark, regardless of the Licensor's quality standards.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a limited license, forbidding usage outside of the contract, while the modified text allows the Licensee greater leeway to use the mark as they deem 'necessary' and to create derivatives freely, explicitly contradicting the original limitations. It also removes the obligation of the Licensee to cure noncompliance, contradicting the previous statement.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall expire if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Licensee. This Agreement shall be terminable (a) by the Licensor (i) at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that the Licensor or the Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of the Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark or (ii) upon sixty (60) days' written notice by the Licensor to the Licensee or (b) by the Licensee (i) at any time in the event such Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of the Licensee's rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor or (ii) upon sixty (60) days' written notice by the Licensee to the Licensor.",

The license granted to the Licensee under this Agreement shall be for a term of one year, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall continue perpetually, regardless of whether the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Licensee. This Agreement shall only be terminable by mutual written agreement of both the Licensor and the Licensee.",
                "explanation": "The original term clause provides for perpetual duration with several termination clauses. The modified clause introduces a one-year term with automatic renewal, contradicting the perpetual duration. Additionally, it removes the Licensor's and Licensee's unilateral right to terminate the agreement and requires mutual agreement for termination, further conflicting with the original terms.",

The Licensee shall have the unrestricted right to sublicense, assign, pledge, grant as security, or otherwise encumber or transfer to any third party all or any part of its rights or duties under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the need for any consent from the Licensor. Any attempts by the Licensor to restrict or prevent such transfer or encumbrance shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly prohibits assignment without the Licensor's consent. The modified clause directly contradicts this by granting the Licensee the unrestricted right to assign their rights and duties, and further, threatens the Licensor with breach of contract for attempting to enforce the original restriction.",

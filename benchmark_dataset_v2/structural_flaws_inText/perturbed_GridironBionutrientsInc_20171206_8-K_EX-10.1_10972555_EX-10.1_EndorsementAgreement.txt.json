                "explanation": "The original text defines a fixed contract period. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the period is \"subject to change based on Company performance,\" which contradicts the initial fixed definition. This creates uncertainty about the contract's duration.",

The $10,000 promotional fee may be payable in quarterly payments if company assets are low.",
                "explanation": "Original text specifies a one-time fee payable in set quarterly installments. The modified version introduces a conditional clause \"may be payable in quarterly payments if company assets are low.\" which directly contradicts the original guarantee of quarterly installment payments. This changes the payment conditions from a requirement to a discretionary option depending on the company's financial situation. This would cause financial disputes with the NFLA.",

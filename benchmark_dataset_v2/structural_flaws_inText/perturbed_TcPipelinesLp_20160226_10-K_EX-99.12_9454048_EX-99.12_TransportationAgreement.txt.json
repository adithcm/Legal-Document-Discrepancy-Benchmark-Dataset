                "changed_text": "6. TERM: This agreement shall remain in effect indefinitely, unless terminated by either party with 30 days written notice. The initial term is November 01, 2014 to October 31, 2017.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a specific term. The modified text introduces an indefinite term with a termination clause, but also retains the original term. This contradicts the fixed term and creates uncertainty about the contract's duration. Does it automatically renew after October 31, 2017, or does the termination clause take precedence?",

RATES:\n\nUnless Shipper and Transporter have agreed to a rate other than the maximum rate, rates shall be Transporter's maximum rates and charges plus all applicable surcharges in effect from time to time under the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) on file with the Commission unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing. Provisions governing a Rate other than the maximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto.",
                "changed_text": "9. RATES:\n\nUnless Shipper and Transporter have agreed to a rate other than the maximum rate, rates shall be Transporter's maximum rates and charges plus all applicable surcharges in effect from time to time under the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) on file with the Commission unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Transporter reserves the right to unilaterally modify rates at any time with no less than thirty (30) days notice, and such modified rates shall supersede any rates detailed within Appendix B. Provisions governing a Rate other than the maximum shall be set forth in this Paragraph 9 and/or on Appendix B hereto.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a rate structure primarily tied to the maximum rates on file with the Commission or as agreed to in writing, possibly in Appendix B. The added sentence allows the Transporter to unilaterally modify rates with 30 days notice, contradicting the need for mutual agreement or adherence to the Commission's maximum rates. This introduces uncertainty about the stability and predictability of rates.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that all notices and communications be in writing. The modified text states that oral delivery is sufficient and written notice is optional. This contradicts the original requirement for written communication, creating ambiguity about the proper method for delivering legally binding notices and potentially leading to disputes over whether notice was properly given.",

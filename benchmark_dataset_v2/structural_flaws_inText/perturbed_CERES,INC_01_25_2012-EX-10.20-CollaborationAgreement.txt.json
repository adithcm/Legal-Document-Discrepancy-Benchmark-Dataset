Confidential Information shall only be made accessible to each Party's employees or students on a need-to-know basis and not to any third party, subject to Articles 7.3 and 7.4. Manuscripts and papers published in scientific journals and presentations made at public meetings that include Confidential Information are exempt from the confidentiality obligations of this Article, provided the Parties followed the procedure set forth in Article 8.",

                "explanation": "Removing the five-year limitation on confidentiality extends the obligation indefinitely, directly contradicting the original stated duration. This introduces uncertainty about when the confidentiality obligations expire, causing conflict.",

                "explanation": "By negating the applicability of Article 4's provisions (including definitions of intellectual property) to all research project results, including those from existing agreements, even when SCHEDULEs or Article 18 don't specify an exception, the revised text directly contradicts the original. This creates uncertainty about which intellectual property rules apply to which results.",

Any commercialization (including, but not limited to, the grant of commercialization licenses) of JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and/or OTHER RESEARCH RESULTS shall result in CERES paying IGER a reasonable remuneration (whether as a royalty or in some other form as the Parties may agree) to be negotiated in good faith.

                "explanation": "The original clause mandated that CERES shall pay IGER reasonable remuneration. The change removes this certainty, making remuneration discretionary ('may or may not'). Furthermore, it states that remuneration terms will not be specified in schedules or other agreements, directly conflicting with the original intention to negotiate and document those terms, thus creating uncertainty about IGER's compensation.",

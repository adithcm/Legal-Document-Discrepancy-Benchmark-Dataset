The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser may, at its sole discretion, indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Adviser 'agrees to indemnify', creating a clear obligation. The modified version uses 'may, at its sole discretion, indemnify,' which contradicts the original obligation. This creates uncertainty about whether FASC is actually indemnified, potentially leading to disputes.",

However, the Adviser may also choose to continue the Limited Power of Attorney indefinitely, even after the termination of the Services Agreement, at its sole discretion. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the powers and authorities herein granted may be revoked or terminated by the Adviser at any time provided that no such revocation or termination shall be effective until FASC has received actual notice of such revocation or termination in writing from the Adviser.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Limited Power of Attorney is automatically revoked upon termination of the Services Agreement. The modified text adds 'However, the Adviser may also choose to continue the Limited Power of Attorney indefinitely', which directly contradicts the automatic termination clause. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the duration of the power of attorney.",

The modified version allows the Adviser to unilaterally modify any provision, contradicting the mutual agreement requirement. This creates uncertainty and imbalance in the contractual relationship.",

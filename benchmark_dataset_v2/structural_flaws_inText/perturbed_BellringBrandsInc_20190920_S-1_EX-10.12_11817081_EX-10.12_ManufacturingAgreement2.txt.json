                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier may purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV of [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term is subject to Heritage's production capabilities and Premier's ongoing satisfaction with product quality, assessed at Premier's sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, regarding the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will aim to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Premier \"shall be required to purchase\" a MAOV, creating a clear obligation. The modified text weakens this obligation by stating that Premier \"may purchase\" a MAOV, making it optional. It also introduces subjective criteria ('Heritage's production capabilities and Premier's ongoing satisfaction with product quality, assessed at Premier's sole discretion') that can override the MAOV, contradicting the initial requirement.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a clause that allows Heritage to modify any term in the contract, potentially overriding all other agreements. This directly contradicts the initial statement affirming that all other terms remain in full effect, creating significant uncertainty about the enforceability of the contract.",

                "original_text": "2.1 Licensor hereby grants Licensed Users a nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, royalty-free license, during the term of this Agreement, to use and display the Licensed Trade Name and the Licensed Mark in the United States solely in connection with the Licensee's corporate name and identifying mark.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Licensor hereby grants Licensed Users an exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license, during the term of this Agreement, to use and display the Licensed Trade Name and the Licensed Mark in the United States solely in connection with the Licensee's corporate name and identifying mark.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original clause. The original grant was non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and royalty-free. The modified clause makes the license exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, and royalty-bearing, creating direct conflicts regarding the rights granted to the Licensee. This creates uncertainty about whether other parties can use the trademark, who owns the rights to the trademark and what costs can be applied.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a stark contradiction regarding termination rights. Originally, either party could terminate with 30 days' notice. Now, the Licensor can terminate at will, while the Licensee faces a much more onerous process, including a substantial financial penalty. This creates uncertainty and imbalance in the parties' rights. Now licensee has restrictions to terminate the license and this restriction is conflicting.",

In the event any suit or other legal proceeding is brought for the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties hereto agree that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party upon final judgment on the merits reasonable attorneys' fees (and sales taxes thereon, if any), including attorneys' fees for any appeal, and costs incurred in bringing such suit or proceeding.",

In the event any suit or other legal proceeding is brought for the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement, Licensor shall be entitled to recover from Licensee upon final judgment on the merits reasonable attorneys' fees (and sales taxes thereon, if any), including attorneys' fees for any appeal, and costs incurred in bringing such suit or proceeding. Licensee shall be responsible for their own attorney fees, regardless of outcome.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an imbalance in the recovery of attorney's fees. Originally, the prevailing party was entitled to recover fees from the other party. Now, only the Licensor can recover fees from the Licensee, regardless of who wins the case. This deters Licensee from pursuing legitimate claims and creates a contradiction about who is responsible for legal costs.",

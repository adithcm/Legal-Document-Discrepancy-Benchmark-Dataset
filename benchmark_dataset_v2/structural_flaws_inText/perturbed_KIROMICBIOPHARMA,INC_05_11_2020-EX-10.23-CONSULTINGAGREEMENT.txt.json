However, the Company can terminate the agreement with immediate effect if it deems the Consultant's performance unsatisfactory. Consultant however needs a 30 days notice to terminate the contract.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in termination terms. It states that both parties can terminate with prior written notice, but then adds an exception allowing the Company to terminate immediately under subjective conditions ('unsatisfactory performance') while the Consultant requires a 30 day notice. This creates uncertainty about the true termination conditions.",

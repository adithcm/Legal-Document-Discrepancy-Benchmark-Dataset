                "original_text": "This Agreement will be in effect for three (3) years from the Effective Date (\"Initial Term\") unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement. This Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (\"Renewal Term\") provided WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term. The Initial Term and any such Renewal Term are collectively referred to as the \"Term.\"",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will be in effect for three (3) years from the Effective Date (\"Initial Term\") unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement. This Agreement may extend for an additional two (2) years on potentially different terms herein (“Renewal Term”), subject to further negotiation and written agreement between the parties. The Initial Term and any such Renewal Term are collectively referred to as the \"Term.\"",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the agreement 'shall automatically extend' under specific payment conditions, creating a clear and defined renewal process. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating the agreement 'may extend' and that the terms could be different ('potentially different terms herein'), requiring 'further negotiation and written agreement'. This contradicts the original automatic renewal clause and creates ambiguity about the renewal process and its terms.",

Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "Zynga may, at its sole discretion, choose to offset Royalty payments with the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. WPT acknowledges that Zynga's decision regarding the offset is final and binding. Conversely, Zynga shall be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments regardless of any Royalty payments made during the Term.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the text specified a clear reciprocal offset mechanism between Royalty and Annual Minimum Guarantee payments, implying a mutual and balanced relationship. The modified text introduces a contradiction by granting Zynga sole discretion over offsetting Royalty payments while simultaneously requiring Zynga to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments regardless of Royalties. This creates an imbalance, potentially favoring Zynga, and contradicts the original intent of the offset provision, introducing uncertainty about the financial obligations of both parties.",

                "explanation": "The original states a clear obligation to maintain sufficient liability insurance. The modified version directly contradicts this by stating each party can *decide whether or not* to have insurance, removing the obligatory nature and creating uncertainty about liability coverage.",

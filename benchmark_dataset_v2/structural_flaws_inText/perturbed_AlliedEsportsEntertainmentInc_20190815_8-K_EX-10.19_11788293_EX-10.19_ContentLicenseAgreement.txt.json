                "original_text": "This Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (\"Renewal Term\") provided WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (\"Renewal Term\") if mutually agreed upon by WPT and Zynga, regardless of whether WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement *shall* automatically renew if a certain payment threshold is met. The modified text changes 'shall automatically extend' to 'may extend if mutually agreed upon' which introduces uncertainty and contradicts the original automatic renewal clause. The elimination of the payment threshold dependency creates further conflict, making the renewal terms discretionary rather than guaranteed.",

Zynga will pay to WPT three million U.S. dollars ($3,000,000) per year according to the following schedule (which the parties may alter upon mutual agreement) (the \"Annual Minimum Guarantee\"): a. Within thirty (30) days of executing this Agreement: $1.5M b. July 1, 2018: $1.5M c. January 1, 2019: $1.5M d. July 1, 2019: $1.5M e. January 1, 2020: $1.5M f. July 1, 2020: $1.5M",
                "changed_text": "Annual Minimum Guarantee. Zynga may pay to WPT up to three million U.S. dollars ($3,000,000) per year at Zynga's sole discretion, and there is no set schedule. Zynga is under no obligation to pay any specific amount at any particular time. Payment amounts and schedules may be determined by Zynga based on its internal budget and strategic priorities.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed Annual Minimum Guarantee with a clear payment schedule. The modification replaces 'will pay' with 'may pay up to' and removes the set schedule. This makes the Annual Minimum Guarantee discretionary and contradicts the original text by introducing ambiguity and uncertainty regarding Zynga's payment obligations. It is no longer clear that WPT will receive any guaranteed minimum amount.",

Zynga's decision to pay any Royalty amount is contingent upon the overall success and profitability of the Zynga Poker game.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for Zynga to pay WPT a 10% Royalty on Net Revenue. The modification changes 'will pay' to 'may, at its sole discretion, pay up to', making the Royalty payment optional and contingent on Zynga's assessment of the game's performance. This directly contradicts the original mandatory payment clause and introduces significant uncertainty about WPT's revenue stream.",

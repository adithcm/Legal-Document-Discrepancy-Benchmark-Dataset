                "original_text": "1.1 Unless otherwise referenced herein, each of the terms used herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it below:     (i) \"Affiliate\", with respect to any Party hereto, shall mean any legal person, non-legal person economic organization, or natural person,  which owns a controlling interest in, or which is controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Party, directly or  indirectly.     As used in this Agreement, \"control\" means the power of any person to direct or cause the direction of management and policies  of another party on account of such person's ownership of equity interest, voting right, the right to appoint directors, by contract  or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 Unless otherwise referenced herein, each of the terms used herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it below:     (i) \"Affiliate\", with respect to any Party hereto, shall mean any legal person, non-legal person economic organization, or natural person, which owns a controlling interest in, or which is controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Party, directly or indirectly. As used in this Agreement, \"control\" means the operational influence a party has over another, regardless of ownership. This includes but is not limited to shared office space, co-branding initiatives, or collaborative projects.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'control' relies on ownership and equity. The modified definition broadens it to include 'operational influence,' even without ownership. This contradicts the initial focus on equity-based control, making it unclear what constitutes an 'Affiliate' and which entities are subject to the agreement's terms.",

                "changed_text": "9.1 This Agreement shall become effective on the date on which it is signed and affixed with the corporate seals by the authorized representative of each Party and have a term of five (5) years commencing as of the effective date hereof. 9.2 This agreement will automatically renew for subsequent one year periods unless either party notifies the other in writing at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term. The licensee maintains the right to determine if the agreement should be extended or not.",
                "explanation": "Initially, the contract term can be extended only upon the licensor's confirmation, and the licensee does not have the right to decide. However, the modified version states the contract will automatically renew unless either party objects, which means the licensee has the power to decide on the extension of the term. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the renewal process and which party ultimately controls the extension.",

If Party B obtains any Intellectual Property Right in respect of the Program Content during its  use of the same, Party B shall notify Party A and, upon its request in writing, sign all documents and take all actions required to assign  such Intellectual Property Right to Party A, and ensure the Intellectual Property Right so obtained by Party A is legitimate, complete,  and free from any encumbrance.",

Party B, however, retains the right to create derivative works based on the program content and will retain ownership of any Intellectual Property Rights associated with these derivative works. If Party B obtains any Intellectual Property Right in respect of the Program Content during its use of the same, Party B shall notify Party A, but retain all rights to that IP.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that Party B does not have any copyright to the licensed content and must assign any IP rights they obtain back to Party A. The modified clause directly contradicts this by granting Party B the right to create derivative works and retain ownership of IP related to those works. This contradiction introduces significant ambiguity regarding the ownership of Intellectual Property rights and what Party B is allowed to do with the licensed content.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'AIG shall' to 'AIG may, but is not required to,' the obligation to provide capital contributions when the company's Total Adjusted Capital falls below the Specified Minimum Percentage is now discretionary rather than mandatory. This directly contradicts the initial statement, creating uncertainty about AIG's commitment to maintaining the Company's capital levels and introducing ambiguity and making AIG's obligation unclear.",

                "explanation": "The original text states AIG 'shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice'. The modified text contradicts this by saying AIG can terminate the agreement 'with or without prior written notice'. This creates uncertainty about the conditions required for termination. Also, original text states the notice 'shall state the effective date of termination,' but modified text says the notice 'may or may not state the effective date of termination' making it unclear how the company would know when the agreement ends.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that policyholders 'shall have the right to demand' enforcement of the agreement, but the modified text says they 'may, at the sole discretion of AIG, have the right to demand'. This change makes the policyholder's right to demand enforcement conditional on AIG's approval, which contradicts the original statement granting them an unconditional right. Furthermore, the final clause is changed to state that all obligations of AIG are terminated on the Termination Date, contradicting the original text that specified AIG remains responsible for contributions that arose prior to termination. This could lead to AIG avoiding capital contributions that should have been made prior to termination.",

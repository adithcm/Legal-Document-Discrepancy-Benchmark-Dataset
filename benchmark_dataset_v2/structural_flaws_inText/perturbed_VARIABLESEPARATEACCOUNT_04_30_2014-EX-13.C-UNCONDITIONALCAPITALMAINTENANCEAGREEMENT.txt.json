Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the modification of corporate structure or sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such modification of corporate structure or sale.

                "explanation": "The original text states that AIG has the \"absolute right to terminate\" but then limits this right with conditions related to corporate structure changes, sale of the company, and ratings. The changed text removes those constraints while maintaining the 'absolute right', thus removing limits on AIG's termination rights creating contradiction, leading to uncertainty about the specific conditions under which AIG can terminate the agreement. It introduces ambiguity and creates a conflict between AIG's unrestricted right to terminate and the potential constraints.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that AIG \"shall\" provide capital contributions when the Company's Total Adjusted Capital falls below the specified minimum, implying a mandatory obligation. The changed text replaces \"shall\" with \"may,\" making the capital contribution discretionary. This creates a direct contradiction, as one part of the section suggests AIG is obligated to contribute capital under certain conditions, while another part suggests it is entirely at AIG's discretion. This contradiction introduces uncertainty about the enforceability of the capital maintenance agreement.",

This creates a contradiction because the initial part of the paragraph grants rights, while the concluding part eliminates them entirely upon termination, leaving ambiguity about the extent to which the policyholders can enforce the agreement, even after it's terminated.",

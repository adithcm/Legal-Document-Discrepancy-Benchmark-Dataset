                "original_text": "     \"ACSI Competitor\" means, collectively, such persons and entities as the Parties may agree upon from time to time.  ACSI may update any agreed-upon list of ACSI Competitors no more frequently than once per quarter by written notice, provided that: (a) the number of entities specified on such list shall at no time [***]; (b) any entities added to such list must be [***]; and (c) no addition of any ACSI Competitor to such list shall require Company to breach any contractual or legal obligation to such ACSI Competitor by which Company is bound as of the date of such addition.",
                "changed_text": "     \"ACSI Competitor\" means any entity that ACSI, in its sole discretion, determines to be a competitor. ACSI may update its list of ACSI Competitors at any time, provided it gives Company written notice. Company is expected to take commercially reasonable steps to avoid violating existing agreements with any ACSI Competitor included in the list. The number of entities specified on such list shall be determined at ACSI's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that ACSI can only update the list of competitors quarterly and sets limitations on the number and type of entities that can be added to the list, with the Company not needing to breach any obligations. The modified text allows ACSI to update the list at any time, removes limitations on the number of entities, and mandates the company to take commercially reasonable steps. This creates a contradiction regarding the frequency of updates and the extent of the company's obligations.",

In consideration for the intangible rights granted hereunder, for each Year in which the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section (including the Mirror Company Site) generates revenue of at [***] (the \"Revenue Threshold\"), Company will pay ACSI a royalty equal to [***] of all revenues generated from the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any revenue received by Company from any Company customer who first links to the Mirror Company Site from the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section and who later accesses the Company Site directly) in excess of Revenue Threshold (the \"Royalties\") for each Year of the Term.  Company will pay ACSI any Royalties payable pursuant to this Section 5.4  [Royalties] on an annual basis, in arrears, as follows: within thirty (30) days after the end of each Year as to which any Royalties are payable, Company will remit to ACSI the Royalties payable with respect to such Year, together with a report specifying in reasonable detail: (a) the gross revenue generated by the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section; and (b) Company's calculation of the  Royalties.",
                "changed_text": "     5.4  Royalties.  Company may, at its sole discretion, pay ACSI royalties if the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section (including the Mirror Company Site) generates what Company considers to be significant revenue. If Company deems royalties are appropriate, the amount will be determined by Company based on a formula that takes into account various business factors. Such payment will be in the form of credit for future advertising to be determined by company. Company is not obligated to provide any specific report regarding revenue or royalty calculations unless it voluntarily chooses to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the company will pay ACSI royalties if the sub-section reaches the revenue threshold, with a specific amount. The modified text makes the payment of royalties discretionary and gives the company full power over the amount and calculation of the payment. It also removes the obligation for the company to provide reports and is replaced with credit for future advertising, all of which directly contradicts the original text.",

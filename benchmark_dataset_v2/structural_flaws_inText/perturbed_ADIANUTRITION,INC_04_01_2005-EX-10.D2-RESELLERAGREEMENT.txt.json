                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding Detto's right to reproduce Qwik-Fix Pro. The original text explicitly states \"Detto shall have no right to reproduce Qwik-Fix Pro or any part thereof.\" The modified text adds a caveat: \"Detto shall have the right to reproduce Qwik-Fix Pro or any part thereof, with PivX's prior written consent.\" This creates uncertainty, as one part of the same section now both forbids and permits reproduction, depending on PivX's consent. Without clear guidelines on when consent will be granted, the enforceability of either clause is weakened.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a clear contradiction regarding the duration of the agreement. The original text specifies a term of six months. The modified version states the agreement continues indefinitely. This creates uncertainty and directly conflicts with the original duration clause, making it difficult to determine when the agreement is actually set to expire. This could lead to disagreements about the ongoing obligations of each party.",

All notices shall be given in writing and shall be considered effective when (a) personally delivered, (b) upon confirmed receipt if sent by electronic mail or facsimile, however, email notices regarding breaches of the agreement are only effective after 30 days; or (c) two (2) days after posting if sent by overnight registered private carrier (e.g. DHL, Federal Express, etc.).",
                "explanation": "This alteration adds ambiguity to the effectiveness of email notices, specifically concerning breaches of the agreement. The original text asserts that all notices are effective upon confirmed receipt when sent via email or facsimile. However, the added clause stipulates that for notices about breaches, email becomes effective only after 30 days. This internal contradiction results in confusion about when a notice of breach is considered officially delivered and initiates the cure period, potentially hindering the enforcement of remedies for contract violations.",

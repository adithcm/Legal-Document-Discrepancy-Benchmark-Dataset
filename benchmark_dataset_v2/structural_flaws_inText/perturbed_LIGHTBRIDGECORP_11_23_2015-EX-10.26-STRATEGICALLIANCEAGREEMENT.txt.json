                "original_text": "Each Party shall present to the other Party every potential Project which such Party desires to pursue.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may, but is not obligated to, present to the other Party potential Projects which such Party desires to pursue. The decision to present a Project is at the sole discretion of each Party.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by initially stating that each party 'shall' present every potential project, creating a clear obligation. The added sentences then weaken this obligation by stating that the party 'may, but is not obligated to,' present projects, and that the decision is at their 'sole discretion.' This creates uncertainty as to whether parties are required to share potential projects or if it is optional, which can affect the collaboration aspect of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "With respect to any Project, regardless of which Party identified such Project, the Parties agree that Lloyds shall act as prime contractor on any Project and that Lightbridge shall have a right of first refusal to participate in such Project as a sub- contractor to Lloyds, and shall be entitled to perform such work which would generate up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total fees payable to Lloyds as general contractor under the Project.",
                "changed_text": "With respect to any Project, Lloyds will generally act as prime contractor. However, Lightbridge may, at its discretion and based on project suitability, act as the prime contractor. Lightbridgeâ€™s role and fees are subject to further negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified that Lloyds 'shall' act as prime contractor. The modified text now states that Lightbridge 'may' act as prime contractor 'at its discretion', contradicting the initial clear specification. This creates uncertainty about which party will be the prime contractor and under what circumstances, affecting the project management structure and revenue sharing.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date and shah continue in effect until the earlier of (a) the fifth (5t h) anniversary of the Effective Date, and (b) termination by either Party for any reason upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that no Party shall be able to terminate this Agreement so long as such Party is a Defaulting Party under this Agreement. The occurrence of the Termination Date shall not relieve either Party of any unfulfilled obligation or undischarged liability of such Party relating to the period prior to the Termination Date.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date. Either party may terminate this agreement with thirty (30) days written notice, unless that party is currently engaged in a Project, in which case termination may be delayed up to one year to ensure smooth completion of any ongoing projects. Additionally, the agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces conflicting terms regarding the termination and renewal of the agreement. The original clause allowed either party to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice, subject to the Defaulting Party clause. The revised clause adds a condition where termination can be delayed up to one year if a party is engaged in an ongoing project, adding a layer of ambiguity to the termination conditions. Furthermore, the introduction of automatic renewal contradicts the implicit understanding of a fixed-term agreement (5 years) as defined in the original clause.",

                "original_text": "Section 2.2 Relationship of Parties. With respect to any Project, regardless of which Party identified such Project, the Parties agree that Lloyds shall act as prime contractor on any Project and that Lightbridge shall have a right of first refusal to participate in such Project as a sub- contractor to Lloyds, and shall be entitled to perform such work which would generate up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total fees payable to Lloyds as general contractor under the Project.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.2 Relationship of Parties. With respect to any Project, the Parties agree that either Lloyds or Lightbridge may act as prime contractor, depending on the specific requirements and client preferences for each Project. Lightbridge's participation as a sub-contractor to Lloyds is not guaranteed but will be considered on a project-by-project basis, and the percentage of fees payable to Lightbridge will be determined through separate negotiation for each project.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Lightbridge a right of first refusal and specifies a percentage of fees. The modified version removes the guaranteed right of first refusal and introduces uncertainty regarding Lightbridge's participation and compensation, making it unclear under what circumstances Lightbridge will be involved and how their fees will be calculated. It contradicts the original set structure.",

This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date and shah continue in effect until the earlier of (a) the fifth (5t h) anniversary of the Effective Date, and (b) termination by either Party for any reason upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that no Party shall be able to terminate this Agreement so long as such Party is a Defaulting Party under this Agreement. The occurrence of the Termination Date shall not relieve either Party of any unfulfilled obligation or undischarged liability of such Party relating to the period prior to the Termination Date.",
                "changed_text": "Section 5.3 Term and Termination. This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date and shall continue indefinitely unless terminated. Either Party may terminate this agreement; however, if a Party is in default, the other party will have the discretion to decide if the termination is allowed. The occurrence of the Termination Date may relieve either Party of unfulfilled obligation or undischarged liability of such Party relating to the period prior to the Termination Date.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a fixed term of five years or termination with 30 days' notice, preventing termination by a Defaulting Party. The modified clause introduces an indefinite term, grants discretion on termination if there's a Defaulting Party, and weakens the survival clause. It creates uncertainty about the contract duration and liabilities post-termination, creating potential for dispute.",

                "explanation": "Originally, this section mandated written notices delivered physically or by fax.

                "explanation": "The original text grants an exclusive license, while the modified text provides a non-exclusive license. Additionally, the license was originally non-transferable and non-sublicensable but it is now transferable and sublicensable. This change creates uncertainty regarding the Licensee's rights to the domain names and could lead to disputes over exclusivity, transfer, and sublicensing of the domain names.",

Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with  Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene  or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes  aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written  notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee's failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of  this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending  Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",

Licensor is not obligated to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites within a reasonable time after it becomes aware of such offending Content. Licensee's failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall not be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor does not have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates Licensee to monitor and censor all content and requires the Licensee to remove any offending content within a strict timeframe. The changed text makes content moderation optional, and also removes the strict timeframe. It also states that Licensee's failure to comply with this section will not be considered a breach of contract, which is contradictory with the original text. Furthermore, Licensor originally had the right to remove offending content, and now does not have the right to do so. This change introduces contradictions about each party's responsibility over content moderation.",

The changed text permits free assignment/transfer, contradicting the original provision.

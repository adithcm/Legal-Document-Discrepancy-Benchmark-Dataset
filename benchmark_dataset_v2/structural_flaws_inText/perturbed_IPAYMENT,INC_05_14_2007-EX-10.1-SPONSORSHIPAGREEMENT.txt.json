                "explanation": "The original text states that ISO is responsible for determining the amount and funding of Merchant Reserve Accounts, and that SERVICERS must disburse funds to merchants upon ISO's request if no violation is found. It also indicates that Servicers will consider ISO's request in good faith. The modified version shifts the responsibility to SERVICERS for determining the amount and funding, and gives SERVICERS sole discretion over whether to release funds, contradicting the original responsibilities and obligations. This change can create uncertainty about who has control over the reserve accounts and when funds will be released. It also removed the part 'upon request, promptly notify SERVICERS of the result of any such investigation' so that it would not notify the other party.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that upon termination, SERVICERS *will* transfer the Merchant Portfolio at the *direction* of ISO, provided certain conditions are met. The modified version replaces the mandatory \"will transfer\" with a discretionary \"may consider a request\" and gives SERVICERS sole discretion over key aspects of the conditions. This contradicts the original obligation and creates uncertainty about whether the transfer will actually occur. The original gave ISO the power to direct Servicers in this regard, and that right is taken away.",

It is then stated that the Bank has obligations to effect a Program Transfer. The text then clarifies that the ISO should own and maintain the Merchant relationship, though the title will be in the bank's name. The modified version creates a contradiction by starting in the Bank's favor: that the Bank does not have any obligations to effect a Program Transfer. The last sentence is added to further give ultimate and final decision-making power to the bank, making this entire section favor the Bank over the ISO.",

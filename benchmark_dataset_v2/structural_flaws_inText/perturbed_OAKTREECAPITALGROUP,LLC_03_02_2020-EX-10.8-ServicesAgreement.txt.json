                "original_text": "10.2 Early Termination\n\nThis Agreement may be terminated, either in respect of a Fund or in its entirety, by either Oaktree US or the Sub-Advisor for any reason upon 30 days' written notice to the other.",
                "changed_text": "10.2 Early Termination\n\nThis Agreement may be terminated, either in respect of a Fund or in its entirety, by Oaktree US for any reason upon 30 days' written notice to the other. The Sub-Advisor may only terminate this agreement if Oaktree US is in breach of its obligations and fails to cure such breach within 60 days of written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding termination rights. The original text allows either party to terminate for any reason with 30 days' notice. The modified version restricts the Sub-Advisor's ability to terminate, requiring a breach by Oaktree US and a 60-day cure period. This creates uncertainty about the Sub-Advisor's actual termination rights, making the clause more favorable to Oaktree US.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that service fees will be agreed upon by both parties from time to time. The altered version dictates that Oaktree US has the sole discretion to decide the fees. This creates conflict and uncertainty regarding how the service fee is decided and whether or not the Sub-Advisor needs to agree. This contradictory placement could cause disputes regarding payment amounts.",

                "original_text": "1.9 The Sub-Advisor shall act honestly, with due skill, care and diligence and fairly and in the best interest of the Partnership in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement and shall use all reasonable endeavours to perform its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with FSMA, the FCA Rules and any other laws, regulations, guidelines and guidance as may be in force from time to time and applicable to the Funds and their business or to the Sub-Advisor (\"Applicable Law\").",
                "changed_text": "1.9 The Sub-Advisor shall act in what it reasonably believes to be the best interest of Oaktree US, provided such actions do not violate Applicable Law. Oaktree US acknowledges that at times, the Sub-Advisor's actions may not align perfectly with the best interest of the Partnership, but Oaktree US shall have no claim against the Sub-Advisor for any such deviation as long as such deviation is undertaken with the intent to comply with this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the duty of the Sub-Advisor. The original clause mandates that the Sub-Advisor act in the best interest of the Partnership. The modified clause requires the Sub-Advisor to act in the best interest of Oaktree US, which may conflict with the best interest of the partnership. The modified text further creates ambiguity by stating the Sub-Advisor's action may 'not align perfectly' with the Partnership. This contradiction introduces uncertainty regarding the Sub-Advisor's fiduciary duty and could lead to legal challenges regarding their actions.",

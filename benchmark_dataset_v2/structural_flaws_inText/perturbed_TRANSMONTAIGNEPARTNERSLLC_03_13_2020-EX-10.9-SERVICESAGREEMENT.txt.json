The Operating Company shall reimburse EmployeeCo for all direct or indirect costs and expenses incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement including, but not limited to:\n\n(d) severance costs with respect to any terminated Services Employees;",

The Operating Company may reimburse EmployeeCo for direct costs incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement including, but not limited to:\n\n(d) severance costs with respect to any terminated Services Employees, subject to available funds and the discretion of the Operating Company;",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Operating Company *shall* reimburse EmployeeCo for severance costs. The changed text makes this reimbursement discretionary ('may reimburse,' 'subject to available funds,' 'discretion of the Operating Company'), contradicting the original mandatory language and creating uncertainty about the obligation.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that all payment obligations *shall survive* termination. The modified version explicitly states that they *shall not survive* termination, creating a direct contradiction regarding the financial responsibilities after the agreement ends, therefore making enforcement uncertain.",

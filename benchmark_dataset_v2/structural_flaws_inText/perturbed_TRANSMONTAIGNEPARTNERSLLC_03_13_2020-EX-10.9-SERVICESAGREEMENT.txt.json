                "original_text": "1.2 Reimbursement and Allocation. The Operating Company shall reimburse EmployeeCo for all direct or indirect costs and expenses incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement including, but not limited to: (a) salaries of the Services Employees; (b) the cost of employee benefits for the Services Employees, including 401(k), pension, bonuses and health insurance benefits (whether through insurance policies provided by third-parties or self-insurance); (c) costs associated with workers' compensation claims and other disputes or liabilities associated with the Services Employees; (d) severance costs with respect to any terminated Services Employees; and (e) all sales, use, employment, excise, value added or similar taxes, if any, that may be applicable from time to time with respect to the Services. Such reimbursements shall be made by the Operating Company to EmployeeCo in advance or immediately upon such costs being incurred, or otherwise in accordance with historical practice, unless otherwise agreed between the Operating Company and EmployeeCo.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 Reimbursement and Allocation. The Operating Company may, at its sole discretion, reimburse EmployeeCo for direct costs and expenses incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to salaries and employee benefits. Reimbursement for costs such as workers' compensation claims, severance costs for terminated Service Employees, and applicable taxes will be subject to further negotiation and agreement between the parties and may not be fully reimbursed. Such reimbursements shall be made by the Operating Company to EmployeeCo only after receiving documented proof of incurred costs and at a schedule determined solely by the Operating Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the Operating Company to reimburse EmployeeCo for all listed expenses. The modified text introduces discretion for the Operating Company regarding reimbursements, creating a contradiction. The original text implies that costs like severance are always reimbursed, while the modified text suggests they might not be, causing uncertainty.",

This Agreement may be terminated by (a) the written agreement of the Parties or (b) by either Party upon 5 days written notice to the other Party. All payment obligations hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.",
                "changed_text": "2.3 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by the Parties. This Agreement may be terminated (a) only through the written agreement of both Parties, or (b) by EmployeeCo giving 5 days written notice. The Operating Company can terminate the agreement at any time without notice. Payment obligations do not necessarily survive termination, and the extent of any surviving obligations will be determined at the sole discretion of the terminating party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows either party to terminate with 5 days' notice. The modified clause gives EmployeeCo only the right to terminate and the Operating Company may terminate without prior notice. Furthermore, the original text states that payment obligations survive termination, while the revised text introduces uncertainty by stating they may not and are determined by the terminating party, introducing contradictions and potential disputes.",

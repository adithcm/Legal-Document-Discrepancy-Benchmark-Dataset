                "original_text": "Unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof, the initial term of this Agreement (\"Initial Term\") will be ten (10) years from the Effective Date, provided that at any time following the 7th anniversary of such date, either party may terminate such strategic alliance upon not less than 60 days' prior written notice to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "Unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof, the initial term of this Agreement (\"Initial Term\") will be ten (10) years from the Effective Date. Either party may terminate such strategic alliance at any time, provided that such termination is mutually agreed upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows termination after the 7th year with 60 days' notice. The modified text replaces this with a requirement for mutual written agreement for termination at any time, contradicting the defined termination right after 7 years. This creates uncertainty as to whether a party can unilaterally terminate after 7 years or if mutual agreement is always required.",

                "original_text": "All notices or other communications required or desired to be sent to either of the parties will be invalid, unless made in writing and sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or sent by recognized international courier service (e.g., Federal Express, DHL, etc.) with charges prepaid, or by facsimile or electronic mail which is subject to confirmation by letter. The address for all notices or other communications required to be sent to ARGO or YEC will be the mailing address stated on the signature page to this Agreement, or such other address as may be provided from one party to the other on at least ten (10) days prior written notice. Any such notice will be effective upon the date of receipt.",
                "changed_text": "All notices or other communications required or desired to be sent to either of the parties will be valid if sent by any reasonable means. The address for all notices or other communications required to be sent to ARGO or YEC will be the mailing address stated on the signature page to this Agreement. Any such notice will be effective immediately upon sending.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific delivery methods for notices to be valid. The modified version contradicts this by stating any reasonable means is sufficient, and removes the requirement for confirmation of electronic notices. It also changes the effective date of the notice to 'immediately upon sending,' conflicting with 'upon the date of receipt.' This introduces ambiguity about how notices should be delivered and when they are considered effective.",

Additionally, if a suit or action is filed to enforce this agreement or with respect to this Agreement, the prevailing party is entitled to reimbursement from the other party for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the suit or action, including reasonable attorney's fees at the trial level and on appeal.",
                "changed_text": "If there is a default under this agreement, the reimbursement of costs and expenses by the defaulting party to the non-defaulting party will be at the sole discretion of the court. Additionally, if a suit or action is filed to enforce this agreement or with respect to this Agreement, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, regardless of the outcome of the suit or action.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates reimbursement of costs and attorney's fees to the non-defaulting/prevailing party. The modified text contradicts this by stating cost reimbursement is at the court's discretion and that each party bears their own costs regardless of who prevails. This removes the certainty of cost recovery for the non-breaching party, creating uncertainty about financial responsibility in case of a dispute.",

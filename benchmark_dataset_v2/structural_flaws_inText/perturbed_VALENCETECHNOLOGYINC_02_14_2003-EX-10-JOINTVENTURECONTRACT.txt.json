                "original_text": "The Joint Venture Company's registered capital shall be contributed according to both Parties' proportion of investment. The detailed method, quantity and timing of the contributions are shown in Appendix 1.",
                "changed_text": "The Joint Venture Company's registered capital shall be contributed according to a schedule determined solely by Party B. The detailed method, quantity and timing of the contributions are shown in Appendix 1, however, Party A must contribute their share within one month of Party B requesting it. Party B's contribution schedule will be at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because the original text specifies that the contribution is according to both parties' proportion of investment and the timing details are in Appendix 1. The modified text states the schedule will be solely determined by Party B, creating uncertainty about Party A's rights and obligations, conflicting with the original intention of shared control.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Joint Venture Company may register its own trademarks, service marks, logos and trade names, and it may use the marks owned by a Party without compensation, provided that the use is in accordance with terms of a written trademark license contract signed with that Party.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party retains all ownership to its trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, and similar designations identified in Exhibit B of the Contract for Technology Investment and any other such marks which such Party may from time to time designate in writing, and the other Party and the Joint Venture Company will neither register or use, directly or indirectly, any mark that is identical or confusingly similar to Valence's marks or any translations or transliterations thereof, anywhere in the world. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Joint Venture Company may register its own trademarks, service marks, logos and trade names. The Joint Venture Company may use the marks owned by a Party without compensation, regardless of the existence or terms of any written trademark license contract signed with that Party.",
                "explanation": "The change removes the requirement for a written trademark license contract for the Joint Venture Company to use the marks owned by a party. This directly contradicts the original text, which explicitly states that the use is permissible only if 'the use is in accordance with terms of a written trademark license contract signed with that Party.' This creates uncertainty about the conditions under which the Joint Venture Company can use the trademarks, potentially leading to disputes.",

The liquidation committee shall value and liquidate the Joint Venture Company's assets at prices they feel are reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the *Board of Directors* will appoint the liquidation committee. The modified text states that *Party B* alone appoints the liquidation committee. The original text specifies that the assets shall be liquidated in accordance with applicable Chinese laws and regulations and the principles set forth herein. The modified text states that assets can be liquidated at reasonable prices. This creates uncertainty about the objectivity of the liquidation process and the protection of Party A's interests.",

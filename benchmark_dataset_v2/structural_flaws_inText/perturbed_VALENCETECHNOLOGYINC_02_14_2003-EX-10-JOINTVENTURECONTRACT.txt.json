                "changed_text": "The Joint Venture Company's registered capital shall be contributed according to a schedule determined solely by Party B, irrespective of both Parties' proportion of investment. The detailed method, quantity and timing of the contributions are shown in Appendix 1.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that capital contributions will align with the parties' investment proportions, while the modified text grants Party B unilateral control over the contribution schedule, contradicting the principle of proportional investment.",

The Party claiming Force Majeure shall promptly inform the other Party in writing and shall furnish within fifteen (15) days thereafter sufficient evidence of the occurrence and duration of such Force Majeure.",
                "changed_text": "If an event of Force Majeure occurs, a Party's obligations under this Contract affected by such an event shall be suspended during the period of delay caused by the Force Majeure. Party A's obligations will be extended without penalty, for a period equal to such suspension, whereas Party B's obligations will not be extended and will instead be subject to penalties as determined by Party A. The Party claiming Force Majeure shall promptly inform the other Party in writing; however, failure to furnish sufficient evidence of the occurrence and duration of such Force Majeure will only impact Party B's obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original text dictates an equitable suspension of obligations for both parties in a Force Majeure event. The modified text unfairly penalizes Party B while extending the extension without penalty only for Party A, creating a contradiction and imbalance.",

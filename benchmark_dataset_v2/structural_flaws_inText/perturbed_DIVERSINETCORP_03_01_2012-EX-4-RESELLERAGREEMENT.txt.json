                "original_text": "During the Term and for seven (7) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or such longer period as required by applicable law,  Reseller agrees to maintain complete books, records and accounts relevant to the computation of and accounting for the amounts payable under  this Agreement. Reseller agrees to allow Diversinet or its agents and representatives the right to examine and audit such books, records and  accounts during Reseller's normal business hours for no more than once per calendar quarter upon reasonable notice. If such examination reveals  a deficiency in any amounts paid, Reseller agrees to pay any such deficiency forthwith upon demand, plus interest calculated in accordance with  Section (Late Charges and Taxes) above and, if in excess of 5%, the cost of the audit incurred by Diversinet.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, Reseller agrees to maintain complete books, records and accounts relevant to the computation of and accounting for the amounts payable under this Agreement. Reseller agrees to allow Diversinet or its agents and representatives the right to examine and audit such books, records and accounts during Reseller's normal business hours at any time and without prior notice. If such examination reveals a deficiency in any amounts paid, Reseller may negotiate the terms of repayment with Diversinet.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a seven-year post-termination audit period with a limited quarterly audit frequency, requiring reasonable notice. The modified text removes the post-termination audit, allows audits at any time without prior notice, and permits negotiation of repayment terms, contradicting the original defined audit terms and payment obligations.",

                "original_text": "Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for  consecutive one (1) year periods, unless terminated by Reseller within sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any renewal term,  as the case may be (the Initial Term and each renewal term, collectively, the \"Term\"). Any annual renewal would be subject to the payment, if  applicable, of the AMC as agreed to by the parties, however such AMC will not be less than the previous year AMC times 115%, payable in  applicable quarterly instalments.",
                "changed_text": "Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall renew for consecutive one (1) year periods based on Diversinet's sole discretion. Any annual renewal may not be subject to the payment of the AMC, as per Diversinet's decision, and may be payable in any manner deemed appropriate by Diversinet.",
                "explanation": "The original text dictates automatic renewal unless the Reseller terminates within 60 days, with a fixed AMC increase. The modified text introduces Diversinet's discretion over renewal and AMC terms, directly conflicting with the original automatic renewal and fixed AMC increase, thus creating uncertainty about the renewal process and payment obligations.",

The addresses and contact information may be changed at any time by giving written notice as allowed under  this section. Reseller's address and contact information are as set out in Schedule 1.",
                "changed_text": "Any notice, demand, or communication between the Parties shall be deemed given and received only when Diversinet acknowledges its receipt in writing. Any other form of communication is not considered valid. Reseller's address and contact information are as may be updated from time to time on Diversinet's website.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies methods for delivering notices (personal delivery, fax, certified mail). The modified text dictates that only communications acknowledged in writing by Diversinet are valid, contradicting the initial acceptable methods and enabling Diversinet to selectively acknowledge communications. It also creates uncertainty about how Reseller can keep the information updated.",

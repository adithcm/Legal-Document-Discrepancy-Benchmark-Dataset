                "original_text": "1.36 \"Field\" means any and all uses.",
                "changed_text": "1.36 \"Field\" means any and all uses excluding any formulation of SHP2 Inhibitor with an immuno-oncology agent that targets PD-1. The JSC may from time to time amend the definition of Field to include additional exclusions.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Field\" is broad, encompassing all uses. The modified definition introduces a specific exclusion (formulations with PD-1 targeting immuno-oncology agents) and allows for further exclusions at the JSC's discretion. This contradicts the initial definition, creating ambiguity about which uses are actually included in \"Field\".",

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to any particular Product or country, all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement with respect to such Product or country shall cease except as otherwise set forth in this Section 12.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, but, for clarity, such termination or expiration shall not affect the Parties' rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the other Products or countries.",
                "changed_text": "12.3 Effects of Expiration or Termination.\n\n(a) General. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to any particular Product or country, all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement with respect to such Product or country shall immediately cease and neither party shall have continuing obligations, except as required by law. For the avoidance of doubt, termination of this agreement with respect to one product shall be construed as termination for all products.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for specific exceptions post-termination, implying some obligations continue. The modified text states that all obligations immediately cease with no exceptions, except as required by law, directly contradicting the original's explicit allowance for continued rights and obligations. The addition that termination for one product shall be considered termination for all products creates further contradiction to the original text.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties will conduct a research program for the identification, validation and optimization of SHP2 Inhibitors (including without limitation back-up compound chemistry and characterization, pre-clinical studies, and translation and biomarker studies) pursuant to a research plan (such plan, the \"Research Plan\").",
                "changed_text": "4.1 General. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, only Sanofi will conduct a research program for the identification, validation and optimization of SHP2 Inhibitors (including without limitation back-up compound chemistry and characterization, pre-clinical studies, and translation and biomarker studies) pursuant to a research plan (such plan, the \"Research Plan\"). RevMed will have no authority regarding the Research Plan or any activities undertaken pursuant to it. The Parties will collaborate only to the extent that Sanofi elects to request feedback from RevMed.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a collaborative research program. The modified text gives Sanofi sole control and removes RevMed's ability to conduct research, contradicting the original intent of a joint effort. RevMed's collaboration is reduced to only providing feedback when requested, fundamentally altering the partnership described in the initial clause.",

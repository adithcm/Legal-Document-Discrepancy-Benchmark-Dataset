This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the \"Sales Term\" as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the \"Term\").\"",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date. The term of this agreement shall be ongoing unless terminated in writing by either party with 30 days' notice, even after the expiration of the 'Sales Term' as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the \"Term\").\"",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the term of the agreement as tied to the 'Sales Term' of another agreement. The modified text introduces the possibility of termination with 30 days' notice, even after the Sales Term expires. This directly contradicts the original, finite term tied to the Sales Dealer Agreement, creating uncertainty about the agreement's duration and enforcement.",

Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement continues in full force and effect according to its terms, creating an expectation of mutual obligation. The modified text adds a clause allowing Vivint Solar to terminate the amendment at its sole discretion, with or without cause. This undermines the continuation clause and creates a contradiction regarding enforceability and obligations.",

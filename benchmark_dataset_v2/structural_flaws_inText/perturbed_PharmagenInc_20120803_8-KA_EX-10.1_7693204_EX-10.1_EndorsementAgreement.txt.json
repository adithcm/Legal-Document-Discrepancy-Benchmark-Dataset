                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and ending  on February 19, 2013 (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and ending  on February 19, 2013 (\"Term\"), unless terminated earlier by either party as outlined elsewhere in this agreement, or extended upon mutual agreement in writing. HDS, at its sole discretion, may extend this agreement beyond the initial term by providing written notice to Celebrity at least 30 days before the initial term's expiration. Such extension shall be for an additional year with the same terms and conditions, unless otherwise modified in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the term of the agreement as one year. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the term is one year 'unless terminated earlier' or 'extended upon mutual agreement'. Furthermore, it gives HDS the unilateral right to extend the agreement, contradicting the initial fixed term. This introduces uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement and Celebrity's obligations, creating a contradiction in terms.",

                "changed_text": "Celebrity represents and warrants that during the Term and in the Territory, Celebrity will not endorse or make any appearances or advertisements on behalf of any other multivitamin, provided, however, that Celebrity may endorse competing products if HDS' Clotamin product fails to meet certain pre-defined sales targets. These sales targets and the procedure for determining whether they have been met, will be outlined in a separate confidential addendum to this agreement. HDS will notify celebrity of these sales targets within 30 days of the execution of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes an exclusivity clause, preventing Celebrity from endorsing competing products. The modified text introduces an exception, allowing Celebrity to endorse competitors if Clotamin's sales targets are not met. This contradicts the initial exclusivity, creating uncertainty about Celebrity's obligations and potentially leading to disputes over whether the sales targets trigger the exception.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that HDS is solely responsible for all liability arising from its product. The changed text contradicts this by stating HDS is not responsible when liability directly results from celebrity actions. This introduces a large amount of legal ambiguity, opening the door for court and lawyer involvement to decide each party's portion of liability, should a problem arise.",

                "original_text": "Licensee may independently enter into an agreement with the owner of the Operating Content to secure Licensee's right to use such Operating Content, and shall be solely responsible for the cost and expense associated with procuring such Content. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee shall be permitted to upload such Operating Content directly onto Licensee's websites or through use of the Licensor's software pursuant to the Software License Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee may independently enter into an agreement with the owner of the Operating Content to secure Licensee's right to use such Operating Content, and shall be solely responsible for the cost and expense associated with procuring such Content. Licensee is not permitted to upload such Operating Content directly onto Licensee's websites without explicit approval by Licensor, which may be withheld at Licensor's sole discretion. Any use of the Licensor's software pursuant to the Software License Agreement for uploading Operating Content is strictly prohibited.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original text by first stating the Licensee is allowed to independently secure rights to use the Operating Content, then contradicting itself by stating that the Licensee is not permitted to upload such content without Licensor's approval. It then outright prohibits the use of Licensor's software, which the original section explicitly permitted.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee agrees to use the Licensed Domain Names only in accordance with such content distribution policy that Licensor uses in connection with its own business, and as may be established unilaterally by Licensor at any time without prior notice to Licensee. Licensee will have no recourse in challenging any content distribution policy.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original text by removing the 'in writing in advance' clause and the 'as may otherwise be agreed to by the Parties from time to time' clause. It also removes the clause where 'Licensee shall be afforded the same period of time to implement any such content distribution policy as is afforded to Licensor's Affiliates and other third parties'. This change gives the Licensor absolute authority over the content distribution policy, directly contradicting the original clause and potentially harming the Licensee.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original text by changing the Licensee's assignment rights, which originally states that the Licensee may assign this Agreement without consent to SINA Leju or an Affiliate of Licensee that is controlled by SINA Leju. In the new text, the Licensee's assignment rights are limited and require prior written consent from Licensor.",

Except as provided in Section 2.3, Licensee's use of the Licensed Domain Names under the terms of this Agreement shall be free of any fees.",

Except as provided in Section 2.3, Licensee's use of the Licensed Domain Names under the terms of this Agreement shall be free of any fees.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants an 'exclusive' license to use the domain names. The modified version grants a 'non-exclusive' license.

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Licensor's exclusive ownership. The modified text introduces an exception for Licensee's 'right to perpetual use', creating a contradiction. This uncertainty could lead to disputes regarding ownership rights and the duration of the license.",

                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time, but such termination will not be immediate and will be subject to a 90-day cure period, even in the event that the other Party (a) becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature; (b) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) seeks relief, or if proceedings are commenced against such other Party or on its behalf, under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtors' relief law and such proceedings have not been vacated or set aside within seven (7) days from the date of commencement thereof. The terminating party has the option to waive the cure period in their sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for 'immediate' termination under specific insolvency events. The modified version adds a mandatory 90-day cure period even for these events, directly contradicting the immediate termination clause. This creates uncertainty regarding the ability to terminate the contract swiftly in cases of financial distress. However, a caveat is introduced, offering the terminating party an exception for the 90-day notice.",

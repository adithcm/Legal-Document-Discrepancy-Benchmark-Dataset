                "original_text": "Network hereby grants to Affiliate the exclusive right via Broadcast Television, and Affiliate hereby accepts such exclusive right and the obligation during the Term to broadcast the Service via Broadcast Television (i) over the transmission facilities of each Station identified on Exhibit A, which is licensed by the FCC to serve the community for each such Station (the \"Licensed Community\"), for receipt by TV Households in the DMA in which the Licensed Community is located, as such DMA is identified on Exhibit A, and (ii) over the transmission facilities of any Acquired Station, except to the extent that, as of the date Affiliate notifies Network in writing of its binding agreement to acquire such Acquired Station, (A) another Broadcast Television station in the same DMA as the Acquired Station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service, or (B) the Acquired Station is obligated to broadcast other material that precludes it from also carrying the Service.",
                "changed_text": "Network hereby grants to Affiliate a non-exclusive right via Broadcast Television, and Affiliate hereby accepts such right and the obligation during the Term to broadcast the Service via Broadcast Television (i) over the transmission facilities of each Station identified on Exhibit A, which is licensed by the FCC to serve the community for each such Station (the \"Licensed Community\"), for receipt by TV Households in the DMA in which the Licensed Community is located, as such DMA is identified on Exhibit A, and (ii) over the transmission facilities of any Acquired Station, except to the extent that, as of the date Affiliate notifies Network in writing of its binding agreement to acquire such Acquired Station, (A) another Broadcast Television station in the same DMA as the Acquired Station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service, or (B) the Acquired Station is obligated to broadcast other material that precludes it from also carrying the Service.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly grants an *exclusive* right to Affiliate to broadcast the service. By changing 'exclusive' to 'non-exclusive,' we introduce a contradiction. Other sections of the contract likely assume exclusivity, creating uncertainty about Affiliate's actual rights and Network's ability to license the service to others in the same DMA. This contradiction directly impacts the enforcement of the agreement regarding territorial rights.",

                "changed_text": "Network retains the right at all times during the Term to discontinue its distribution of the Service in its entirety and to terminate this Agreement and all other affiliates' agreements on at least ninety (90) days' prior notice with liability to Affiliate equal to one year's worth of advertising revenue, calculated based on the average quarterly revenue from the previous year, other than amounts payable hereunder which accrued prior to such termination, including amounts payable pursuant to Section 6(b) and Exhibit D.",
                "explanation": "The original text says there is no liability for the network to stop providing the service with 90 day notice. The changed text says there is liability equal to one year's advertising revenue. This contradiction directly impacts the enforcement of the agreement regarding the costs associated with early termination.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly prohibits Affiliate from attacking the validity of the Network's trademarks. By removing 'not,' the clause now *requires* Affiliate to attack the trademarks. This creates an immediate and fundamental conflict of interest and renders the clause nonsensical, undermining the entire section on trademark protection and potentially leading to legal action regardless of Affiliate's actions. This impacts enforcement by making the clause impossible to uphold.",

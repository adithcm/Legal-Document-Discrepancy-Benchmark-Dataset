This Agreement commences on the Effective Date, and terminates, along with all licenses and  authorizations granted under it, upon the earliest of termination in accordance with the following.\n\n  7.1.   This Agreement shall be for the term of one year; thereafter, the Agreement shall renew automatically under these same  terms and agreements unless superceded by future agreements.\n  7.2.   This Agreement may be terminated by either party with cause upon thirty (30) days written notice. Upon Marketing  Affiliate's default in payment or other breach of this Agreement, Equidata may terminate this Agreement without notice  to Marketing Affiliate. Upon termination for any reason, Equidata reserves the right to deactivate Marketing Affiliate's  access to the services including the Equidata Web Site. Termination does not release Marketing Affiliate from paying  all amounts owed to Equidata.",

Termination does not release Marketing Affiliate from paying  all amounts owed to Equidata.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Equidata can terminate the agreement 'without notice' upon Marketing Affiliate's default. The changed text introduces a contradiction by stating that Equidata can only terminate with thirty days notice, even in the case of Marketing Affiliate default. This creates ambiguity around the conditions for termination and the notice period required.",

Marketing Affiliate shall be responsible for collecting all amounts due directly from the Consumer and  shall bear sole responsibility for non-payment of any fees charged to the Consumer. Marketing Affiliate shall pay to  Equidata, as compensation for its providing of Services under this agreement, such amounts as outlined and detailed in  Exhibit A attached hereto. Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable in  full by Marketing Affiliate 30 days from the invoice date.",

Such amounts shall be billed on a bi-monthly basis by Equidata and are due and payable by  Marketing Affiliate at Equidata's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text places the sole responsibility of collecting amounts from the consumer on the marketing affiliate. The modified version introduces a contradiction by saying Equidata may collect amounts directly, removing the Marketing Affiliate's obligation to collect all amounts. Furthermore, payment timelines are set at Equidata's discretion, creating uncertainty in contrast to the original text's firm payment date.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that both parties indemnify each other for any claims arising from breach of warranties or failure to provide services. The modified version limits the scope of indemnification to only cases of 'gross negligence or willful misconduct', contradicting the original broad indemnification clause. This introduces uncertainty regarding each party's liability for breaches of warranty or service failures that do not rise to the level of gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

The Revenue Report shall be accompanied by payment to the Non-Billing Party of all amounts owed as set forth on such Revenue Report, as well as - when applicable - the exchange currency rate.",

The Revenue Report shall be accompanied by payment to the Non-Billing Party of all amounts owed as set forth on such Revenue Report, as well as - when applicable - the exchange currency rate. However, payment is due within 60 days of the Revenue Report date.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dassault Systemes can terminate the contract immediately, without any prior notice or cure period, in the event of PlanetCAD failing to provide Level 2 support as outlined in Schedule B. In addition to the right to terminate this Agreement, the non-breaching party, shall have all rights and remedies available at law and in equity.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a 60-day cure period for any breach before termination. The added sentence contradicts this by allowing Dassault Systemes to terminate immediately for a specific breach (failure of Level 2 support), creating uncertainty about the general applicability of the cure period.",

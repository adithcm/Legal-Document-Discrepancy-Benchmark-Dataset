                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' focuses on control through ownership. The modified definition broadens this to include any business relationship. This creates an in-text contradiction because sections relying on the original definition (control) will be ambiguous when applied to entities that merely have a business relationship. This introduces uncertainty in the enforcement of obligations linked to 'Affiliates'.",

This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date and shah continue in effect until the earlier of (a) the fifth (5t h) anniversary of the Effective Date, and (b) termination by either Party for any reason upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that no Party shall be able to terminate this Agreement so long as such Party is a Defaulting Party under this Agreement. The occurrence of the Termination Date shall not relieve either Party of any unfulfilled obligation or undischarged liability of such Party relating to the period prior to the Termination Date.",
                "changed_text": "Section 5.3 Term and Termination. This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date. Either Party may terminate this agreement at any time, but in the event of early termination, the terminating party will pay a penalty of $1,000,000 to the other party unless the termination occurs due to the other party being in default. The occurrence of the Termination Date shall not relieve either Party of any unfulfilled obligation or undischarged liability of such Party relating to the period prior to the Termination Date.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows termination for any reason with 30 days notice, except if a party is in default. The modified clause introduces a termination penalty of $1,000,000 unless the non-terminating party is in default, contradicting the ability to terminate 'for any reason'. This creates a contradiction regarding the conditions and consequences of termination. This creates uncertainty in enforcement because it is unclear if a party can terminate without penalty even with 30 days notice.",

With respect to any Project, regardless of which Party identified such Project, the Parties agree that Lloyds shall act as prime contractor on any Project and that Lightbridge shall have a right of first refusal to participate in such Project as a sub- contractor to Lloyds, and shall be entitled to perform such work which would generate up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total fees payable to Lloyds as general contractor under the Project.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Lloyds acts as the prime contractor and Lightbridge has the right of first refusal as a subcontractor. The modified text reverses this, stating Lightbridge is the prime contractor and Lloyds has the right of first refusal. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the roles of each party in a Project. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, because each party will dispute which party will be doing which action. ",

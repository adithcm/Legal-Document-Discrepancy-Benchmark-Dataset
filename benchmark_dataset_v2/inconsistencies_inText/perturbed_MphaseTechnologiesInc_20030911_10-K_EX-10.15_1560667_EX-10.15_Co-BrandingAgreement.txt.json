Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.          mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current          quality of their Goods.",

Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.          mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current          quality of their Goods.\n\n8.        Notwithstanding section 7, mPhase's sole responsibility concerning the quality of goods is that they meet all applicable regulatory standards at the time of sale.  Lucent shall have no recourse against mPhase for issues of quality beyond those regulatory requirements.",
                "explanation": "Section 7 requires mPhase to maintain a comparable level of quality to their current goods.  The added text in section 8, however, limits mPhase's quality responsibility to meeting regulatory standards, effectively negating the requirement to maintain the prior quality level. This creates a contradiction as to what standard of quality mPhase must adhere to, causing potential dispute.",

Notwithstanding Section 11, Lucent reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, upon providing 10 days written notice to mPhase.",
                "explanation": "Section 11 requires 30 days' notice for termination by either party. Section 11a allows Lucent to terminate with only 10 days' notice and without cause, contradicting the original termination clause and creating uncertainty about the actual notice period and termination conditions.  It is unclear if Lucent is bound by the 30 days notice period or the 10 days notice period.",

Upon termination of this Agreement, mPhase shall immediately cease use          of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, provided, however, that mPhase shall          have no obligation to remove such Co-Branding Logo from any Goods sold          prior to the date of such termination.",

                "explanation": "Section 12 states that mPhase must immediately cease use of the logo upon termination, but allows them to sell goods already produced with the logo. The newly added section 12a then gives mPhase 6 months to sell off existing inventory post-termination, which implies the continued use of the logo beyond termination. While seemingly clarifying, it creates conflict because the 'cease use' clause is not clearly defined, it's unclear if selling existing inventory means they can't advertise those goods.",

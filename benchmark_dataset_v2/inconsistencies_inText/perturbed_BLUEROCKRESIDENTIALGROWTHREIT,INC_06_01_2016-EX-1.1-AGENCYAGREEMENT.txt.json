Immediately and only upon receipt of funds equal to the gross offering price of the Offered Shares, the Agent will then facilitate payment of the proceeds net of the Agent's fees specified herein, to the Company in Federal (same day) funds by wire transfer to an account at a bank acceptable to the Agent drawn to the order of the Company at the office of Bass, Berry & Sims PLC (\"BBS\"), no later than 5:30 P.M., New York time, on May 26, 2016. If, as of 5 P.M., New York time, on the Settlement Date, the settlement of the Offered Shares has not been fully consummated, including without limitation, receipt of the net offering proceeds by the Company, then Agent shall use its best efforts to promptly deliver any of the Offered Shares that have been transferred by the Company to the credit of the Agent's or its designee's account to the Company's designated account through coordination with the Company and its transfer agent. For purposes of Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, the Settlement Date (if later than the otherwise applicable settlement date) shall be the settlement date for payment of funds and delivery of securities for all the Offered Shares sold pursuant to the offering. The Offered Shares so to be delivered or evidence of their issuance will be made available for review at the above office of BBS at least 24 hours prior to the Settlement Date.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding the Settlement Date. Originally, the Settlement Date was explicitly defined as 'May 26, 2016, or at such other time not later than seven (7) full business days thereafter as the Agent and the Company mutually determine'. The modified text removes the 'or at such other time...' clause, so there is no allowance to extend the settlement date. This contradicts the final execution and creates uncertainty over the actual settlement date.",

Conditions (i) is set 'prior to the Settlement Date'. These contradictions create confusion about the termination rights of the Agent and when those rights apply.",

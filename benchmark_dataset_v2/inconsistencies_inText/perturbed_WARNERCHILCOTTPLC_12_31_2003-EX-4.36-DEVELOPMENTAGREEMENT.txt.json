This payment is non-refundable.",
                "changed_text": "3.3      Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, GALEN will pay to LEO          US$5,000,000 (five million United States dollars) to reimburse LEO for          a portion of the actual development costs that have been incurred by          LEO. This payment is non-refundable, except in the event that the FDA does not approve the NDA within 24 months of submission, in which case 50% of the payment is refundable to GALEN.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the refundability of the $5,000,000 payment. Initially, it's stated as non-refundable. The added clause introduces a condition under which a portion of the payment *is* refundable, creating uncertainty. This uncertainty can create disputes over payment terms, as both parties can claim conflicting payment deadlines/obligations.",

The payments are non-refundable.",

The payments are non-refundable, unless LEO fails to initiate the clinical trial within six months of the FDA mandate, in which case GALEN is not obligated to pay any further invoices, and all prior payments will be credited toward future obligations, if any. If no further obligations arise, LEO shall refund the payments within 30 days of the end of the six-month period.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that GALEN's payments for the clinical trial are non-refundable. However, the modification introduces a condition where the payments are essentially refundable if LEO fails to initiate the clinical trial within a specific timeframe. This creates a conflict about when payments can be refunded, impacting the payment deadlines.",

                "explanation": "The original section states a non-refundable payment, while the changed section states that it must be refunded based on the remaining term, creating a direct in-text contradiction.",

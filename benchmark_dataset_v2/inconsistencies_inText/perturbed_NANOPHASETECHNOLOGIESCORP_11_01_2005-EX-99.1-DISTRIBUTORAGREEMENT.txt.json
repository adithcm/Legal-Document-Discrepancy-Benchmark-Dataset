Excepting any amounts disputed in good faith, balances unpaid after such period will be subject to a finance charge of 1% per month or may be offset against any balances owed by NTC to ALFA AESAR. The parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any disputed invoice.

Excepting any amounts disputed in good faith, balances unpaid after such period will be subject to a finance charge of 1% per month or may be offset against any balances owed by NTC to ALFA AESAR.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding late payment fees. The original text states that unpaid balances after 30 days are subject to a 1% monthly finance charge. The added sentence states that balances unpaid after 45 days are not subject to any finance charges. This creates uncertainty as to when late fees are applicable, potentially leading to disputes. One section mentions 30 days for fees, while the other references 45 days without fees.",

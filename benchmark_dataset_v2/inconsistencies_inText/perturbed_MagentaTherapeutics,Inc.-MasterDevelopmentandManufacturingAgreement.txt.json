Unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing by the Parties, including as agreed in a Project Plan, (i) all invoices and payments hereunder shall be in U.S. Dollars, (ii) payments will be made payable to Bachem at the address set forth in applicable Project Plan(s), and (iii) all undisputed payments shall be made within [***] of receipt of invoice by Magenta.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by specifying a different payment deadline for invoices exceeding $[***]. While the general rule states payment is due within [***] of receipt, a new clause states that for higher value invoices, payment is due within 15 days. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about the payment terms for high-value invoices, leading to potential disputes.",

In the event of any other termination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the appropriate amount to be paid by Magenta to Bachem (or refunded to Magenta by Bachem, as the case may be), in light of the circumstances of such termination, in compensation for all Services rendered in accordance with this Agreement. In the event of Bachem's inability to supply the Product or a material breach by Bachem pursuant to Section 7.2(b), Bachem shall provide, without additional charge to Magenta, sufficient information and technology pertaining to its Services to Magenta and/or its technically competent designee, such that Magenta and/or its technically competent designee are enabled to continue Development Work and manufacture of the Product.

                "explanation": "The added exception to Section 7.2(a) conflicts with the initial clause of the section, which allows Magenta to terminate any Project Plan for any reason with [***] written notice.

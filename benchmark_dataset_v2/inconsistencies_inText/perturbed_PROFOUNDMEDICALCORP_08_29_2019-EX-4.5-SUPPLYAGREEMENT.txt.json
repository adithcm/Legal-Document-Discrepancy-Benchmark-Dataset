                "original_text": "6.4 Philips invoices, compliant with the requirements of this Agreement, will be payable within [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] following the end of the month of the date of invoice. Customer shall make all payments in Euros by check, wire transfer or automated clearing house to the bank account designated by Philips.",
                "changed_text": "6.4 Philips invoices, compliant with the requirements of this Agreement, will be payable within [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] following the end of the month of the date of invoice. However, for the first three months of each calendar year, invoices will be payable within 90 days following the date of invoice. Customer shall make all payments in Euros by check, wire transfer or automated clearing house to the bank account designated by Philips.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by specifying two different payment terms. The original clause states invoices are payable within a certain period following the end of the month of the invoice date. The modified clause adds an exception where invoices during the first three months of each year are payable in 90 days from the invoice date, contradicting the initial general payment term and creating uncertainty.",

However, any products used in military applications will have a warranty period of only 30 days. Products repaired or replaced by Philips within the Warranty Term are warranted for the remainder of the original Warranty Term of said Products.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation creates an in-text contradiction. It provides a general warranty period in Clause 7.4, but then introduces a conflicting, shorter warranty period for products used in military applications, making it unclear which warranty period applies in that specific case.",

Philips may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect by written notice to Customer, should Customer not have filed with the specified bodies to transfer the applicable registrations within the time period specified in clause 2.3.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the customer may terminate without cause. The modification then states that such termination requires a $500,000 fee. This creates a contradiction because a termination 'without cause' usually implies no penalty, directly conflicting with the stated fee.",

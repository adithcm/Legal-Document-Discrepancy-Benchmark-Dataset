For list more products, Party B shall apply to Party A 3 working days in advance and after obtaining the consent of Party A, pay the deposit in full within 5 working days from the date of receipt of the deposit notice from Party A.",

For list more products, Party B shall apply to Party A 3 working days in advance and after obtaining the consent of Party A, pay the deposit in full within 3 working days from the date of receipt of the deposit notice from Party A.",
                "explanation": "This introduces an inconsistency regarding the payment deadline for the initial deposit. Originally, it was 5 working days. Now it becomes 15 working days. For additional deposits, it originally said 5 working days from the date of the deposit notice, but now it says 3 working days. This creates confusion and uncertainty as to when the deposit is actually due.",

                "explanation": "Here, a contradiction is introduced regarding the time frame for replenishing and increasing the deposit. Now it says the increase should be within 10 working days. However, it is 2 working days to replenish funds. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes.",

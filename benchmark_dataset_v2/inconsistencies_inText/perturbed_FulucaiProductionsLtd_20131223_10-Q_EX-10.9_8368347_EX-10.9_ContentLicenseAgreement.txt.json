                "original_text": "3. Consideration. The Producer agrees and acknowledges that it will receive no upfront compensation for the rights it has granted herein and that ConvergTV has no obligation to Producer to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement. The revenue share for the Program is stated in Exhibit B. The Producer shall have thirty (30) days from the payment date to dispute the amount of any revenue share payout or any such claim or dispute is hereby waived by the Producer.",
                "changed_text": "3. Consideration. The Producer agrees and acknowledges that it will receive no upfront compensation for the rights it has granted herein and that ConvergTV has no obligation to Producer to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement. The revenue share for the Program is stated in Exhibit B. The Producer shall have fifteen (15) days from the payment date to dispute the amount of any revenue share payout or any such claim or dispute is hereby waived by the Producer.",
                "explanation": "Changing the dispute period from thirty (30) days to fifteen (15) days creates a conflict with any other references to the dispute period elsewhere in the agreement or its exhibits, leading to potential disputes over whether a claim was made in a timely manner. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement of payment terms.",

                "changed_text": "During the License Term (which is identified in the Deal Terms), Producer agrees that ConvergTV has the exclusive right to exercise the rights granted to it under this Agreement with respect to the Program, including those in Section 1, within the Licensed Territory, except for distribution on emerging Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms where the Producer retains the right to license to others.",
                "explanation": "Adding an exception to the exclusivity clause creates a contradiction. The original clause grants exclusive rights, while the addition allows the Producer to license content to OTT platforms. This creates uncertainty about the scope of ConvergTV's exclusive rights and could lead to disputes over distribution rights.",

                "explanation": "Adding an exception to the indemnification clause, such as excluding liability for ConvergTV's gross negligence or willful misconduct, creates a contradiction. The original clause provides broad indemnification, while the addition limits it. This introduces uncertainty about when the Producer is obligated to indemnify ConvergTV and could lead to disputes over liability.",

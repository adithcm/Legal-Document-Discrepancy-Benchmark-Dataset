                "original_text": "III. Time of Payment\n\n(a) Each payment for a particular calendar month shall be due no later than the (20th) day of the subsequent calendar month.\n\n(b) The Licensee shall calculate the license fee payable to the Licensor for each month based on the Monthly Notional Volume  bands for that pay period and shall pay the Licensor accordingly. In no event shall the amount payable by the Licensor be  less than the amount recorded by the Licensee as being traded with the Licensed Technology multiplied by the applicable  Fees set forth above.",

Time of Payment\n\n(a) Each payment for a particular calendar month shall be due no later than the (20th) day of the subsequent calendar month.\n\n(b) The Licensee shall calculate the license fee payable to the Licensor for each month based on the Monthly Notional Volume  bands for that pay period and shall pay the Licensor accordingly. In no event shall the amount payable by the Licensor be  less than the amount recorded by the Licensee as being traded with the Licensed Technology multiplied by the applicable  Fees set forth above.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the above clauses, the Licensee shall have an extended payment period of 45 days from the end of each calendar month for all payments due under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "A new clause (c) is added to Section V, contradicting the payment deadline specified in clause (a). Clause (a) states that payments are due by the 20th of the subsequent month, while clause (c) allows for a 45-day payment period. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the actual payment due date, which could lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "An additional clause is added to Article XXI that gives the Licensee 30 days to transfer the Licensed Technology to a third party despite the rights and license being terminated immediately. This directly contradicts the initial statement that upon termination, all rights automatically terminate. This creates an exception with unclear parameters (mutually agreed-upon third party) that undermines the original intent of immediate termination.",

                "explanation": "An exception clause is added to Article II Section II (f) regarding reverse engineering. The original text strictly prohibits reverse engineering, but the added clause states the Licensee *can* reverse engineer for compatibility purposes. This creates a contradiction, as the Licensee is both prohibited and permitted to reverse engineer, depending on the purpose.",

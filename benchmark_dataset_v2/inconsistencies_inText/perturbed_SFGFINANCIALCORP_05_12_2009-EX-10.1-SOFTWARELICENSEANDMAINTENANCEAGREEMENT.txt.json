(b) The Licensee shall calculate the license fee payable to the Licensor for each month based on the Monthly Notional Volume bands for that pay period and shall pay the Licensor accordingly.

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Licensor receives one third of gross amounts earned from specific areas during the term of the agreement with no stated limitations. The added sentence creates a contradiction by stating that the entitlement to supplemental payments will cease if the Licensee reaches a monthly notional volume exceeding US$ 50 billion. This creates uncertainty about when the payments must be remitted, which could be disputed and cause breaches of contract.",

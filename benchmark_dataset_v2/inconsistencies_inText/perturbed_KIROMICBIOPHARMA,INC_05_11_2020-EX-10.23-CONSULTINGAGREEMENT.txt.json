                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline from 'thirty (30) days' to 'sixty (60) days.' This conflicts with any other clauses within the contract (or potentially incorporated documents) that might specify a different payment timeframe, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over when payment is actually due.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'which shall not be unreasonably withheld' to 'which may be withheld at the company's discretion,' a contradiction is introduced. The original text implies a good-faith requirement for waiving the non-compete, while the changed text gives the Company unfettered discretion. This creates uncertainty regarding the consultant's ability to engage in potentially competitive activities.",

Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the licenses granted hereunder (i) are irrevocable and (ii) may not be terminated for any reason (even in the event of a material breach), except that (a) with respect to Licensed IP that constitutes Third-Party Intellectual Property, solely as provided in Section 2.4(a), (b) with respect to a particular Patent licensed under this IP Agreement, the license granted to such Patent shall automatically terminate upon the expiration of the statutory term (including all extensions and renewals) of such Patent, and (c) Seller may terminate the license granted to the Purchaser Licensees pursuant to Section 2.2(c) (and no other provision of this IP Agreement), following the Initial Closing Date and upon prior written notice to Purchaser, in the event Purchaser materially breaches Section 2.2(c) and fails to cure such material breach within one hundred twenty (120) days after Purchaser's receipt of written notice from Seller (which such notice shall contain a reasonable description of such material breach and a statement of Seller's intent to terminate the license granted to the Purchaser Licensees pursuant to Section 2.2(c) if such material breach is not cured within such one hundred twenty (120) day period). Nothing herein shall preclude any party from seeking damages or other remedies at law or in equity (other than termination of this IP Agreement or any license to any Intellectual Property granted under this IP Agreement) for any breach hereof.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction regarding the termination of licenses. While the initial part of Section 4.2 states licenses are irrevocable, exception (c) allows the Seller to terminate licenses under certain conditions. The added text grants the Purchaser similar termination rights but with a significantly shorter cure period (30 days instead of 120), creating an inconsistent enforcement standard.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction to the general assignment clause. Initially, the section outlines specific scenarios where assignment is permitted with notice but without prior consent. The added sentence explicitly prohibits assignment to a direct competitor of the Seller, overriding the earlier allowances. This creates uncertainty: can the Purchaser assign to an entity that meets one of the listed criteria but is also a direct competitor? Which clause takes precedence?",

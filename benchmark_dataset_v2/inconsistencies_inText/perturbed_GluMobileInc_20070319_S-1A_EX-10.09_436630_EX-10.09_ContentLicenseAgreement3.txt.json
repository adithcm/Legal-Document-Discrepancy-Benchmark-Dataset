(\"IA2 Audio and Video Royalty\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may not recoup any portion of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "changed_text": "From the first unit sold, Fox shall earn a royalty at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's Gross Receipts (as defined in the Agreement) from Licensee's sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products. (\"IA2 Audio and Video Royalty\"). Licensee may recoup up to fifty percent (50%) of the Ice Age 2 Guarantee (as defined in Amendment 1) through its sale and distribution of the IA2 Audio and Video Wireless Products.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the recoupment of the 'Ice Age 2 Guarantee'. The original text explicitly prohibits recoupment, while the modified text allows recoupment up to 50%, creating uncertainty about the financial obligations of the Licensee.",

These payments are not subject to Paragraphs 7(b)(ii) and 7(b)(iii) of the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict by stating that VGSL and other CSP payments are not subject to Paragraphs 7(b)(ii) and 7(b)(iii) of the original agreement, effectively contradicting the original agreement. This introduces ambiguity about whether those paragraphs apply, which concern how revenues are calculated.",

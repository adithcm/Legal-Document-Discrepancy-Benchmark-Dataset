                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Initially, late fees and potential service termination apply after 30 days of non-payment. This change modifies the period to 60 days, which now creates confusion about when late fees are applied or services terminated. Does it happen after 30 days or 60?",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding the termination notice period. Originally, a 30-day notice was required before the end of the term. This has been changed to 60 days, making it unclear which notice period applies and creating uncertainty in contract enforcement. This could lead to disputes if one party attempts to terminate with 30 days' notice, while the other party insists on 60.",

                "explanation": "This change alters the cure period for payment failure. Originally, a 15-day cure period was allowed for payment failures. It's now changed to 30 days.

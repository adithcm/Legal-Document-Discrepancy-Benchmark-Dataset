                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by allowing Netzee to potentially alter the agreed-upon fee structure. This undermines the original fixed-fee agreement and creates uncertainty regarding the actual cost of maintenance. The 'unless otherwise agreed' clause provides no specific guidelines, potentially leading to arbitrary fee adjustments and disputes.",

Following the completion of such maintenance term, Bankers Bank may, at its option, renew maintenance for subsequent periods of one (1) year each, subject to adjustments proposed by Netzee not to exceed 5% at least sixty (60) days in advance of the applicable renewal date.",

Following the completion of such maintenance term, Bankers Bank may, at its option, renew maintenance for subsequent periods of one (1) year each, subject to adjustments proposed by Netzee not to exceed 5% at least sixty (60) days in advance of the applicable renewal date. Netzee reserves the right to terminate the maintenance agreement at any point during the renewal period with a 30-day notice.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a clause allowing Netzee to terminate the agreement during the renewal period, contradicting the implication that Bankers Bank has the right to renew for a full year, subject only to a 5% price adjustment. This introduces uncertainty about the duration of the maintenance and undermines Bankers Bank's renewal option.",

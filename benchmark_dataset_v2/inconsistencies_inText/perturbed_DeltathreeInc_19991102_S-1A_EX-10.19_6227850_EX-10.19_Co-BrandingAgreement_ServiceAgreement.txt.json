                "original_text": "Any amounts due hereunder shall be calculated and paid in U.S. dollars on a monthly basis within twenty-five (25) business days following the receipt of the reports detailed in Sections 3.06 [Reporting] and 4.02 [Reporting] hereof or any other invoices provided for herein. All payments shall be made via wire transfer in accordance with written instructions from the parties.",
                "changed_text": "Any amounts due hereunder shall be calculated and paid in U.S. dollars on a monthly basis within twenty-five (25) business days following the receipt of the reports detailed in Sections 3.06 [Reporting] and 4.02 [Reporting] hereof or any other invoices provided for herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments for services outlined in Article IV shall be due within ten (10) business days of invoice receipt. All payments shall be made via wire transfer in accordance with written instructions from the parties.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in payment terms. The original text states a 25-day payment window for all amounts due. The modified text creates an exception for services in Article IV, shortening the payment window to 10 days. This creates uncertainty regarding which payment term applies to Article IV services.",

                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be effective as of the date first stated above and shall continue for a term of three (3) years, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that PrimeCall may elect to terminate this Agreement, upon thirty (30) days' written notice, at any time from and after the time that collectively RSL Communications, Ltd. and/or its Affiliates holds less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting control of DeltaThree's outstanding shares. \"Affiliate\" as used in this Agreement in the context of termination rights shall mean any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such person. However, for all other purposes, \"Affiliate\" shall also include any entity with which a party has a strategic business alliance, regardless of control.",
                "explanation": "Here, the definition of 'Affiliate' is made inconsistent. For the termination clause, the original definition applies (control). For other parts of the agreement, the definition expands to include strategic alliances, irrespective of control. This creates ambiguity because sections related to revenue sharing or liability might depend on affiliate status; the different definition could result in disputes about who counts as an affiliate and which definition to rely on.",

However, a breach of Section 4.01 shall allow for immediate termination.",
                "explanation": "The general termination clause requires a 30-day cure period for material breaches. The addition of 'However, a breach of Section 4.01 shall allow for immediate termination' introduces a direct contradiction. This creates a situation where it's unclear if a breach of Section 4.01 requires a cure period or allows for immediate termination, causing significant enforcement uncertainty.",

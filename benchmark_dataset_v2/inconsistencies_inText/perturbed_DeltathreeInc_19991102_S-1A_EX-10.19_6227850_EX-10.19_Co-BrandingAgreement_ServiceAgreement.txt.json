On or before the tenth day of each calendar month, PrimeCall shall prepare for DeltaThree a report detailing the total revenues and expenses associated with the sale and use of the Calling Cards in the previous month. In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree shall provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within seven (7) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",

In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree shall provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction with Section 4.02 [Reporting], which states a seven-day dispute notice period. Now, there's ambiguity about whether DeltaThree has 7 or 14 days to dispute PrimeCall's report.",

                "explanation": "This change provides a longer payment timeline of thirty (30) days, whereas the modified Section 4.02 extends the period to dispute the report. If PrimeCall disputes the report close to the 10-day deadline, and DeltaThree is now working with a new payment term of 30 days from report finalization, there are conflicting interpretations as to when the payments are due.",

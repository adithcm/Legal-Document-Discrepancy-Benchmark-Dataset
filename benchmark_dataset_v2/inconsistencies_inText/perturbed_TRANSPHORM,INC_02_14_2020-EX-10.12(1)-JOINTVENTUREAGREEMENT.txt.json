The Parties expect the Company to comply with the Business Plan; provided, however, deviations from the Business Plan that result in an increase or decrease of less than twenty percent (20%) of the original cost or revenue to the Company attributable to such item as set forth in the Business Plan shall not require the consent of the Parties, so long as all such deviations in any given quarter do not represent a deviation of more than ten percent (10%) of total revenue or total expense, as the case may be, in the aggregate for the quarter in which the deviation occurs. No Party shall, however, have any assurance that the Company will achieve the Business Plan, except as to the number of wafers that each of FSL/AFSL and TPH/TPH-A commits to purchase in the Business Plan. In the event that FSL/AFSL or TPH/TPH-A, as applicable, has failed to purchase its applicable number of wafers in accordance with the Business Plan, then such Party shall compensate the Company for the shortfalls in the actual revenue of the Company attributable to its failure to purchase such wafers versus its share of the planned revenue set forth in the Business Plan. As soon as it becomes practicable after the end of each quarter, but not later than thirty (30) days thereafter, the Parties shall review the actual revenue of the Company versus the Business Plan based on the wafer loading by each of FSL/AFSL and TPH/TPH-A for the previous quarter, and if there are any shortfalls in revenue from the Business Plan in such quarter, the compensation for such shortfalls shall be made by a Party who caused such shortfalls to the Company within sixty (60) days after the end of the fiscal year of the Company where such quarter resides. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if a Party, its Affiliate or another third party purchases such Party's committed number of wafers in the Business Plan, such Party shall not be deemed to have caused a shortfall in the revenue of the Company and (ii) the revenue attributable to a Party's failure to purchase its number of wafers in accordance with the Business Plan shall equal (A) the number of wafers not purchased, multiplied by (B) the agreed price (as set forth in the Business Plan) per wafer.",

                "explanation": "The modified text introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the deviation percentages and the payment deadlines. The original clause states a 10% deviation limit and shorter payment deadlines while the modified one states 15% and extended timelines, causing uncertainty on which one should be enforced.",

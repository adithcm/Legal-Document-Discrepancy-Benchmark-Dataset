                "explanation": "The original text states that the Royalty Fee will be paid within 30 days of the *succeeding* quarter, while the modified text specifies 60 days of the *preceding* quarter, creating a direct contradiction regarding the payment deadline.",

However, after the term concludes, she may endorse other brands with no restrictions.",
                "explanation": "The original text has a two-year restriction on endorsements post-term. The modified text removes this restriction, stating she can endorse other brands freely after the term, directly contradicting the original non-compete clause and creating uncertainty regarding the extent of the endorsement restrictions.",

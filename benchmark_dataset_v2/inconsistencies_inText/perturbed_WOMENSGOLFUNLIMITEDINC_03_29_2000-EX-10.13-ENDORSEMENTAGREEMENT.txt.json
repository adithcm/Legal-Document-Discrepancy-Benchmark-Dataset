The modified text introduces a condition where the base fee is reduced to $18,000 if no products are created, thus conflicting with the initial statement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces multiple contradictions related to stock options. It modifies the exercise price of the options to be 'ten percent (10%) below' closing price instead of 'the closing price' of the stock. The limit on the number of options is increased from 'fifteen thousand (15,000)' to 'twenty five thousand (25,000)'. The option expiry is reduced from 'five (5) years' to 'two (2) years'. Finally, it alters the assignability of options, stating any attempt to assign without consent 'shall be allowed' rather than 'shall be void', contradicting the original clause.",

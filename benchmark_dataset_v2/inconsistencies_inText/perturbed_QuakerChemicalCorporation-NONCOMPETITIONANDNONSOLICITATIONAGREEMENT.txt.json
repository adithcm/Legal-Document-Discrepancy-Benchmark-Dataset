Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Non-Compete Period shall automatically be extended by one (1) year if the Buyer's revenue decreases by more than 10% in any fiscal year during the initial Non-Compete Period. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by adding a clause that the Non-Compete Period can be extended if the Buyer's revenue decreases. This conflicts with the initial definition of the Non-Compete Period as being fixed at two years after the Closing Date, creating uncertainty and potential disputes about the actual duration of the restriction.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that Sellers can hire employees through general solicitation, provided that it doesn't exceed five annually. This directly contradicts the previous sentence stating that clause (2) shall NOT permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period, thereby creating confusion about whether hiring is allowed or not, and under what conditions.",

This conflicting statement creates ambiguity as to the remedies available to the Buyer in the event of a breach of the non-compete or non-solicitation provisions.",

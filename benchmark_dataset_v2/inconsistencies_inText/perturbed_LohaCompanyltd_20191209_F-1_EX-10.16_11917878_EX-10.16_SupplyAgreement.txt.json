PAYMENT: Under Letter of Credit or T/T: Under the Letter of Credit: The Buyer shall open an irrevocable letter of credit with the bank within 30 days after signing the contract, in favor of the Seller, for 100% value of the total contract value. The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1. The remaining 20% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.2. The Letter of Credit shall be valid until 90 days after the latest shipment is effected.",

This uncertainty could lead to disputes over when payment is officially due and when late fees (if any exist elsewhere) might be applied. Which clause is enforceable becomes ambiguous.",

The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery.

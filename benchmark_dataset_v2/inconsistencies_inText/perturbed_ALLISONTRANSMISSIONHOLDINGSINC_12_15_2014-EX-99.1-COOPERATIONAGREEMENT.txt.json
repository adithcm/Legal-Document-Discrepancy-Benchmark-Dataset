The changed text directly contradicts this by stating that *all* portfolio companies *are* considered 'ValueAct Affiliates', regardless of those same conditions.

The modified text changes this to subsections (i) or (iii). This creates an inconsistency regarding the conditions under which the Company's obligations can terminate, especially concerning the resignation of the ValueAct Designee, leading to disputes over whether Section 1(e) needs to be satisfied before termination can occur based on a change in ownership or breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text restricts remedies to injunctions and specific performance, exclusively in Delaware courts, providing a 10-day cure period for breaches. The changed text broadens the remedies to include monetary damages, allows enforcement in *any* court of competent jurisdiction, and reduces the cure period to 5 days with no exception. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the available remedies, the forum for dispute resolution, and the time allowed to rectify breaches, potentially leading to legal disputes over which terms are enforceable.",

                "original_text": "For calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before March 31, 2017.",
                "changed_text": "For calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before March 31, 2017. However, an initial payment of 50% of the estimated Franchise Fee for 2016 is due on December 31, 2016.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a requirement for an initial payment of 50% of the estimated Franchise Fee by December 31, 2016, while the original text states that the entire Franchise Fee for 2016 is due on March 31, 2017. This creates uncertainty regarding when and how much payment is required, potentially leading to disputes.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, should Roanoke Gas Company experience a net loss in any given calendar year, the Franchise Fee payment deadline is automatically extended to June 30 of the succeeding calendar year.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a clause that extends the Franchise Fee payment deadline to June 30 if Roanoke Gas Company experiences a net loss. This contradicts the original text, which states that the payment is due on or before March 31 of the succeeding calendar year. This creates uncertainty about the payment deadline and introduces a subjective condition (net loss) that could be subject to interpretation and potential disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise maintain at least one business office within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per week for the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers. However, Grantee reserves the right to conduct business remotely and may close the physical business office without penalty upon providing thirty (30) days written notice to Grantor.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. While the original text mandates a physical business office open 40 hours a week, the added text allows the Grantee to close the office with 30 days notice. This creates uncertainty whether a physical office is actually required, potentially leading to disputes over service accessibility and compliance with the franchise agreement.",

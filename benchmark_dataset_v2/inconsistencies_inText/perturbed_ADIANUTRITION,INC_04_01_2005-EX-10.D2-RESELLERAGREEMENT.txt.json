Detto shall pay PivX a late charge on outstanding amounts due equal to one and one-half percent (1.50%) per month or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline from 30 days to 60 days, while other clauses might still refer to the original 30-day deadline or assume prompt payment within that timeframe. This creates uncertainty about when payments are actually due and when late charges apply.",

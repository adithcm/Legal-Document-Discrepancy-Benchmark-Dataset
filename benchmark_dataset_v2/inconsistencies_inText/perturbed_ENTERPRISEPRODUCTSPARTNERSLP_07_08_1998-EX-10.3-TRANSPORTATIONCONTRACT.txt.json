                "original_text": "2. (a) Carrier shall invoice Shipper for the services provided under this contract promptly upon performance.  All sums due under any invoice shall be payable without discount upon receipt of the invoice. Amounts more than 30 days past due shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment at the lesser of 1) the rate of interest established by Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, NY, from time to time as its prime rate, plus two (2) percent, or 2) the maximum non-usurious interest rate which may be charged Shipper pursuant to applicable Texas law, Article 5069-1.04 Texas Rev. Civ. Stat., as amended.",
                "changed_text": "2. (a) Carrier shall invoice Shipper for the services provided under this contract promptly upon performance. All sums due under any invoice shall be payable without discount within 60 days of receipt of the invoice. Amounts more than 30 days past due shall bear interest from the due date to the date of payment at the lesser of 1) the rate of interest established by Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, NY, from time to time as its prime rate, plus two (2) percent, or 2) the maximum non-usurious interest rate which may be charged Shipper pursuant to applicable Texas law, Article 5069-1.04 Texas Rev. Civ. Stat., as amended.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by initially stating payment is due upon receipt of invoice, but later providing a 60-day window for payment without discount. This contradicts the immediate payment requirement, causing uncertainty regarding payment terms and when late fees apply. Which creates in-text contradictions and ambiguity in the contract.",

As compensation for the services provided by Carrier under this contract, Shipper shall pay Carrier in accordance with 1) Rate Appendices making reference to this contract which shall from time to time be agreed to between the parties and 2) Carrier's Contract Carriage Rules and Regulations attached as Exhibit A, which are incorporated in this contract by this reference for all purposes (collectively, the \"Schedule\").",

As compensation for the services provided by Carrier under this contract, Shipper shall pay Carrier in accordance with 1) Rate Appendices making reference to this contract which shall from time to time be agreed to between the parties, and are always subject to change without notice, and 2) Carrier's Contract Carriage Rules and Regulations attached as Exhibit A, which are incorporated in this contract by this reference for all purposes (collectively, the \"Schedule\").",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the stability of the agreed-upon rates. The original text implies that the Rate Appendices are fixed once agreed upon, while the modified text suggests they are subject to change without notice. This creates uncertainty about the actual compensation terms and violates the original intention.",

This contract shall be for a term of one year commencing on the date first above written; thereafter, it shall automatically continue until terminated by either party upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party. However, Carrier may terminate the contract immediately, at its sole discretion, if Shipper violates any term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict in the termination terms. While both parties initially need 30 days' notice, the Carrier gains the power to terminate immediately for any violation by the Shipper. This introduces ambiguity about termination procedures and the validity of the 30-day notice requirement, making the contract uncertain and unfair.",

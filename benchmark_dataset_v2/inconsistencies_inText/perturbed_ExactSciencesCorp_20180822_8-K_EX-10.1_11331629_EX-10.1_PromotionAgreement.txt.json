                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by modifying the deadlines for delivering financial data and paying the promotion fee. Section 4.3(a) originally stated Exact had 15 business days to deliver monthly performance data, but this has been altered to say 30 days. Section 4.3(b) initially required Exact to deliver and remit the promotion fee within 30 days after the end of each quarter, which is modified to 15 days. This creates ambiguity because the contract now contains conflicting timelines for important deliverables and payments, potentially leading to disputes.",

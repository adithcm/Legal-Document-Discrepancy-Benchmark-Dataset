Exact shall on a monthly basis, not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the month, deliver to Pfizer a full suite of performance data, including Product Laboratory Services completed, average selling price per unit, Laboratory Service Revenue, rebates, net revenue and a detailed Cost of Sales schedule",

Exact shall on a monthly basis, not later than thirty (30) Business Days after the end of the month, deliver to Pfizer a full suite of performance data, including Product Laboratory Services completed, average selling price per unit, Laboratory Service Revenue, rebates, net revenue and a detailed Cost of Sales schedule",
                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction by extending the deadline for Exact to deliver performance data to Pfizer from fifteen (15) to thirty (30) business days.

                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by changing the timeline for termination without cause. The original agreement allows either party to terminate after eighteen (18) months with six (6) months' notice, while the modified version only allows it after twenty-four (24) months with three (3) months' notice. This directly conflicts and causes uncertainty about when and how termination without cause can occur.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by modifying the duration of the tail period royalty payments. The original text stipulates that the royalty payment should last for twelve (12) consecutive Calendar Quarters following the termination but it is six (6) in the modified text. This would cause ambiguity regarding the duration of the royalty period.",

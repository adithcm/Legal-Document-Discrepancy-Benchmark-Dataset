Your Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions are due by the first (1st) day after the end of each Period (or the next business day if the first day is a Sunday or federal holiday) (as of the Agreement Date, the due date is Monday of each week). You must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement or, if no time is specified, such amounts are due upon receipt of an invoice from us.",

You must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement or, if no time is specified, such amounts are due within 30 days upon receipt of an invoice from us.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction. The original text specifies that all amounts due other than Royalty and Advertising Contributions are due upon receipt of an invoice, while the modified text states these other amounts are due within 30 days of receipt. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a contradiction concerning the deadline to open the franchised business. The original text stipulates a six-month timeframe, while the modified version extends this period to twelve months. This inconsistency leads to uncertainty regarding the enforceable deadline, increasing the likelihood of disputes over timely compliance with the franchise agreement.",

                "explanation": "This edit introduces conflicting information regarding the period allowed to resolve monetary defaults. While the unaltered text mandates resolution within a ten-day timeframe post notification, the altered text permits a thirty-day window for rectification. This contradiction undermines the clear terms of enforcement and generates disputes around default periods.",

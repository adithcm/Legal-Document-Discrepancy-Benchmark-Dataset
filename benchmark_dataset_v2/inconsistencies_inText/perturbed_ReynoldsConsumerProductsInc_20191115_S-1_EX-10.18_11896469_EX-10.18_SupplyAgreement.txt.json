                "original_text": "If Buyer fails to pay Seller an amount owed under this Agreement by the invoice due date, then Buyer will owe Seller: (i) the delinquent amount; and (ii) a late payment fee equal to two percent (2%) of the delinquent amount for each full or partial calendar month past the invoice due date that the delinquent amount remains unpaid.",
                "changed_text": "If Buyer fails to pay Seller an amount owed under this Agreement by the invoice due date, then Buyer will owe Seller: (i) the delinquent amount; and (ii) a late payment fee equal to two percent (2%) of the delinquent amount if the payment is not received within 15 days of the invoice due date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying that the late payment fee only applies if the payment is not received within 15 days of the invoice due date, whereas, without modification, the late payment fee is applied for each full or partial calendar month the payment is late. This creates ambiguity about the timing of late fee application.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may suspend performance or terminate this Agreement or any accepted purchase order for a product being purchase and sold under this Agreement immediately on written notice to the other Party, and without providing the other Party an opportunity to cure the material breach or attempting to resolve a Dispute over the material breach by negotiation or mediation as provided in this Section, for a material breach by the other Party involving substantial harm to the reputation, goodwill and business of the non-breaching Party. Any termination under this clause, however, shall require 60 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that a party can immediately terminate the agreement for a material breach causing substantial harm, but then requires a 60-day written notice for termination. This creates ambiguity as to when the termination is actually effective.",

However, a receiving party may retain indefinitely such confidential information after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that confidential information should be returned or destroyed within 10 days of a request, but then allowing the receiving party to indefinitely retain such information after the agreement's termination. This creates ambiguity and contradicts the initial instruction to return/destroy the information.",

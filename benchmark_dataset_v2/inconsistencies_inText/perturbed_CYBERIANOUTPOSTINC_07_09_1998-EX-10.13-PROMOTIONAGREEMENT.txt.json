Payments                  under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by                  the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such                  reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within                  30 days after the end of each month of the Term.",

                "explanation": "This introduces an inconsistency by allowing payment by check in addition to wire transfer, giving the Company more flexibility. It also contradicts the 'nonrefundable' clause by adding exceptions for CNET's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The terms of refund become uncertain.",

                "explanation": "This changes the cure period for a material breach from 30 days to 60 days.

This Monthly Payment shall be due by the 10th      day of each month; However, for the first three months of the agreement, the monthly payment is due on the last day of the month.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. Initially, all monthly payments are due on the 10th of each month. The added clause states that for the first three months, payments are due on the last day of the month. This creates confusion about the payment deadline for those initial months.",

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the accounting report for the period ending December 31st, 1999, must be provided within thirty (30) days of the end of the quarter.",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the deadline for providing quarterly accounting reports. The original clause specifies a 60-day window after the end of each quarter. The addition shortens the deadline to 30 days for the December 31st, 1999 quarter, creating uncertainty about which deadline applies.",

                "explanation": "This introduces conflicting termination clauses. The original clause requires 30 days' notice for termination due to a breach of material terms. The addition allows HCI to terminate with only 15 days' notice under specific circumstances (MediaLinx failing to meet traffic requirements), creating uncertainty about which notice period applies.",

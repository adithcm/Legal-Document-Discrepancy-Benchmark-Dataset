                "original_text": "Unless otherwise agreed by PPG SHANGHAI in writing, DISTRIBUTOR shall prepay all the invoiced amount in the currency and manner as indicated by PPG Shanghai. DISTRIBUTOR shall be deemed to complete its payment obligation upon full payment of the invoiced sum, and such amount has been allocated into the account as directed by PPG SHANGHAI. PPG SHANGHAI shall only have the obligation to deliver the Products upon full and due payment.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise agreed by PPG SHANGHAI in writing, DISTRIBUTOR shall prepay 50% of the invoiced amount in the currency and manner as indicated by PPG Shanghai. The remaining 50% of the invoiced amount will be paid 60 days after the invoice date. DISTRIBUTOR shall be deemed to complete its payment obligation upon full payment of the invoiced sum, and such amount has been allocated into the account as directed by PPG SHANGHAI. PPG SHANGHAI shall only have the obligation to deliver the Products upon receiving the first payment of 50%.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment terms. The original text specifies full prepayment, while the modified text allows for partial prepayment and a 60-day payment window for the remaining balance. This creates ambiguity about the required payment schedule and could lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the time allowed to correct payment defaults. The original text allows ten (10) business days, while the modified text extends this to thirty (30) business days. This could lead to disputes about when a default is considered incurable and whether termination is justified.",

                "explanation": "This change causes conflicting timelines for agreement renewal. Originally, notice of intent was due 30 days prior, with a 60-day negotiation window. Now, the notice period is extended to 60 days, but the negotiation period is shortened to 30, causing contradictory expectations for the renewal process.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by stating that the monthly fee is calculated up to the '15th calendar day' of the preceding month, while the original text stated 'the last calendar day of such preceding calendar month'. This introduces ambiguity regarding the period for which the Remarketing Agent is to be compensated.",

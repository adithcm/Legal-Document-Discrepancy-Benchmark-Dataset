                "original_text": "Subsequent contributions will be provided by Kiromic to the common fund upon presentation of individual purchase orders and/or proofs of expenditure —which will be paid for each time starting upon the successful IPO (Initial Public Offering) of the Kiromic's common shares.\n\nMolipharma undertakes to financially support the entire research program against sars-cov-2.",
                "changed_text": "Subsequent contributions will be provided by Kiromic to the common fund upon presentation of individual purchase orders and/or proofs of expenditure —which will be paid for each time starting upon the successful IPO (Initial Public Offering) of the Kiromic's common shares. All payments by Kiromic must be made within 30 days of receiving the purchase orders.\n\nMolipharma undertakes to financially support the entire research program against sars-cov-2.\n\nSubsequent contributions will be provided by Molipharma to the common fund upon presentation of individual purchase orders and/or proofs of expenditure - which will be paid for each time. Molipharma has 60 days to make all payments.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Kiromic will pay 'upon the successful IPO', but the changed text adds 'All payments by Kiromic must be made within 30 days of receiving the purchase orders.' creating a contradiction.  Molipharma originally had no specific payment timeline, but a 60 day window was created for their payment. This creates ambiguity as to when the payment is actually due and introduces a conflict regarding payment deadlines.",

In such case, all current work must be completed and delivered to Kiromic at no additional cost.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the JV lasts for * years with a non-renewal clause one year prior to expiry. The changed text allows termination at any time with only 30 days notice, creating a contradiction. This undermines the original duration clause, leading to uncertainty about the commitment's length.",

                "explanation": "The original text indicates that Intellectual Property rights remain as agreed upon in Clause 5 even after termination. The changed text adds that upon termination, ALL rights revert to Kiromic Biopharma, thus directly contradicting the original statement.",

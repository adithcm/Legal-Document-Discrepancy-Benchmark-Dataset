Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and shall fail to remedy any such default within one hundred twenty (120) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",

Licensor and Licensee will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the event the other party is in material breach of any of its obligations hereunder and shall fail to remedy any such default within thirty (30) days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by shortening the cure period for a material breach from 120 days to 30 days. This creates uncertainty regarding the actual timeframe allowed to remedy a breach before termination, leading to potential disputes.",

Licensor, as owner of the Licensed Mark, shall have the right at all times to control and approve the nature and quality of the Licensed Products (and the Licensed Mark thereon), and to inspect Licensee's business operations upon reasonable prior notice for the purpose of ensuring that a high level of quality of the Licensed Products is being maintained by Licensee. At Licensor's reasonable request during each calendar year, Licensee shall submit samples to Licensor, at no cost to Licensor, and shall not materially depart therefrom without Licensor's prior express written consent. The Licensed Products, as well as all promotional, packaging and advertising material relative thereto, shall include all appropriate legal notices as required by Licensor.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates a conflict by changing the cost of sample submissions from 'no cost to Licensor' to 'Licensee's sole cost'. It also changes the party responsible for ensuring proper legal notices from 'Licensor' to 'Licensee'. This introduces ambiguity as to who bears the financial burden and responsibility for these crucial aspects of quality control and legal compliance.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such consent of Licensor is required under this Agreement in the event of a Change of Control of Licensee so long as: (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person assumes all the obligations of the Licensee by operation of Law or pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Licensor; and (b) the licenses granted herein shall not be transferrable or sublicensable to Affiliates of such Person unless such Affiliates were Affiliates of Licensee prior to such Change of Control.",

The modified text states that the Licensor may withhold consent at its 'sole discretion'. Also, the criteria for licenses granted to affiliates are removed after the change of control.",

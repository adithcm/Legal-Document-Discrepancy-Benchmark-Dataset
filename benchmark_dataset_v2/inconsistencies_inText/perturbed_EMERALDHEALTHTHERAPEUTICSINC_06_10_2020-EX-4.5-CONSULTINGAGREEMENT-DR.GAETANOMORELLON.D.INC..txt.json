All obligations of the Company to the Contractor hereunder shall immediately terminate and cease as of the date of the termination of the Contractor's engagement. The Company shall only be obliged to pay the Fees agreed to but not yet paid as of the date of termination, with such payment to be made within 30 days of the date of termination.",

The Company shall only be obliged to pay the Fees agreed to but not yet paid as of the date of termination, with such payment to be made within 90 days of the date of termination.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the payment deadline after termination from 30 days to 90 days. This creates uncertainty regarding when the final payment must be made, potentially leading to disputes.",

For the purposes of this definition, the term \"control\" when used with respect to any person or entity means the power to direct the management and policies of such person or entity, directly or indirectly, whether as an officer or director, through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "(a) \"Affiliate\" means any person or entity related to the Company. For the purposes of this definition, the term \"control\" when used with respect to any person or entity means having a business relationship with said company, directly or indirectly, or being involved in a joint venture. For the purposes of clarity, control can be demonstrated through collaborative projects.",
                "explanation": "This changes the definition of 'Affiliate.' The original definition specified control as the power to direct management and policies, usually through ownership. The modified text broadens it to *any person or entity related to the Company.* Control is redefined as merely a 'business relationship' or 'involvement in a joint venture'. This contradicts other sections relying on a stricter definition of control.",

The Contractor may terminate this Agreement and his or her engagement for any reason at any time upon providing 30 days advance notice in writing to Emerald. However, if the contractor terminates the agreement within the first six months, they forfeit 50% of the fees payable.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a penalty for early termination by the Contractor within the first six months, contradicting the initial statement that termination can occur 'for any reason at any time' without mentioning any penalty. This creates an ambiguity regarding the Contractor's termination rights and potential financial implications.",

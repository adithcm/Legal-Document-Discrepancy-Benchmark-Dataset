The original text specifies payment in Tenge, while the modified text dictates payment in US dollars. Furthermore, the original text uses the Delivery Date for the exchange rate, while the modified text uses the invoice date. This could lead to disputes over which currency and exchange rate should be applied.",

The original text specifies an automatic extension of 12 months and a 65-day notice period for termination. The modified text reduces these to 6 months and 30 days, respectively. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes regarding the actual term of the contract and the requirements for termination.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by extending the payment deadline in section 3(b) to 45 days, conflicting with the payment term established in section 3(a) which states that initial orders must be paid by April 15, 2000. This introduces uncertainty about the correct payment deadline and when late payment penalties would apply.",

In the event COMWARE  purchases an amount less than      $45,420.00, this Agreement will be automatically extended for 3 months to allow COMWARE to meet purchase requirements, after which, if the minimum amount is not met, the agreement will automatically terminate.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction by introducing a clause that extends the agreement for 3 months, if COMWARE purchases less than $45,420, giving them an opportunity to meet the purchase requirements. This directly conflicts with the original clause in Section 4 which states the agreement will automatically terminate if the minimum amount isn't met.",

Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Dong-A, NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at the exchange rate of the payment date, no later than [***] days prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer to Dong-A. NeuroBo shall be responsible for and pay all wire transfer fees incurred in the Territory. If Dong-A does not receive payment of any sum due to it on or before the due date, [***] interest shall thereafter accrue on the sum due to until the date of payment at the [***] rate of [***] percent ([***]%) over the then-current prime rate quoted by Citibank in New York, New York or the maximum rate allowable by New York law, whichever is lower.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that 'no interest shall accrue' on late payments, conflicting with the original clause that specifies interest accrual details for overdue payments. This creates ambiguity regarding whether interest is applicable for late payments.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires payment no later than '[***] days prior to the shipment date'.

                "original_text": "B. All payments are due on the later of: (1) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "B. All payments are due on the later of: (1) within thirty (30) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the tenth (10th) of the month following receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the tenth (10th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by altering the payment deadline. The original clause states payment is due within 15 days of the invoice or the 27th of the following month, whichever is later. The modified clause extends the initial period to 30 days but shifts the subsequent date to the 10th of the following month. This ambiguity makes it unclear which deadline is enforceable, leading to potential disputes over payment terms.",

Unless provided otherwise in a TSA between Carrier and Shipper, if any charge remains unpaid after the due date, then such amount due may bear interest from the day after the due date until paid, calculated at an annual rate equivalent to the greater of (1) one percent (1%) or (2) the maximum rate allowed by law.",
                "changed_text": "C. Unless provided otherwise in a TSA between Carrier and Shipper, if any charge remains unpaid after the due date, then such amount due may bear interest from sixty (60) days after the due date until paid, calculated at an annual rate equivalent to the lesser of (1) ten percent (10%) or (2) the minimum rate allowed by law.",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by changing the parameters for calculating interest on late payments. It alters the starting point from \"the day after the due date\" to \"sixty (60) days after the due date.\" It also changes the interest rate calculation from the \"greater of 1% or the maximum rate\" to the \"lesser of 10% or the minimum rate\". These changes can significantly impact the amount of interest accrued on late payments, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

If Shipper fails to pay an invoice by the due date, Carrier will notify Shipper of the failure, and if Shipper has not remedied the failure within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from Carrier, in addition to any other remedies under this Tariff or under applicable law, Carrier shall have the right, either directly or through an agent, to sell any Products of such Shipper in Carrier's custody at public auction, on any day not a legal holiday, not less than forty-eight (48) hours after publication of notice of such sale in a daily newspaper of general circulation published in the town, city, or general area where the sale is to be held, stating the time and place of sale and the quantity and location of the Products to be sold.",
                "changed_text": "J. If Shipper fails to pay an invoice by the due date, Carrier will notify Shipper of the failure, and if Shipper has not remedied the failure within ten (10) days following receipt of notice from Carrier, in addition to any other remedies under this Tariff or under applicable law, Carrier shall have the right, either directly or through an agent, to sell any Products of such Shipper in Carrier's custody at private auction, on any day not a legal holiday, not less than twenty-four (24) hours after publication of notice of such sale in a weekly newspaper of limited circulation published in the town, city, or general area where the sale is to be held, stating the time and place of sale and the quantity and location of the Products to be sold.",
                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by altering the timeframe for the shipper to remedy a payment failure before the carrier can sell the shipper's products. The original allows 30 days, while the modified text reduces it to 10 days. It also changes public auction to private auction, forty-eight hours to twenty-four hours, and daily newspaper of general circulation to weekly newspaper of limited circulation. This creates uncertainty about the procedures and timeframe for the sale of the Shipper's product. This creates a legal ambiguity.",

The Royalty rate shall be [*] percent ([*]%) on the Affinities and Reference Content; and [*] percent ([*]%) on Translated Content.",

The Royalty rate shall be [*] percent ([*]%) on the Affinities and Reference Content; and [*] percent ([*]%) on Translated Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, royalties for Reference Content shall be calculated at [*]% for the first year, and then at [*]% thereafter.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by introducing a different royalty calculation for Reference Content, specifying a tiered rate over time that conflicts with the initial, flat royalty rate. This creates ambiguity regarding how royalties for Reference Content should be calculated, particularly in the first year.",

The original text specifies payment within [*] days after the end of the calendar *year*, while the modified text requires payment within [*] days after the end of the calendar *quarter*.

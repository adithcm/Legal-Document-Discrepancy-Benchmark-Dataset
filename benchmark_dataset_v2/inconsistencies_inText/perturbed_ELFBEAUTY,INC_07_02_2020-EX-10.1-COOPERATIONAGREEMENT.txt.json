                "explanation": "The original text states that the Marathon Parties shall provide written evidence of their vote no later than ten business days prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting. The changed text reduces this timeframe to five business days. This creates a conflict because the two sections provide different deadlines, creating uncertainty as to which deadline should be enforced.",

                "explanation": "The original text says that Section 8 shall survive termination. The changed text adds that Section 5 shall also survive termination. The inconsistency lies in that another section now survives termination without a clear indication in other relevant section.

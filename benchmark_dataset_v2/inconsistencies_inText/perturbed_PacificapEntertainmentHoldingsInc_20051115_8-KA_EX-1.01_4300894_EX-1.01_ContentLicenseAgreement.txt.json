                "original_text": "Within 30 days of the end of each quarter during the term of this agreement, PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT shall receive from THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, a detailed accounting statement showing Net Due and Paid Shared Revenues for that quarter and shall remit to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT its share of such revenues.",
                "changed_text": "Within 30 days of the end of each quarter during the term of this agreement, PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT shall receive from THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, a detailed accounting statement showing Net Due and Paid Shared Revenues for that quarter and shall remit to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT its share of such revenues.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, all payments due to PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT must be remitted within 15 days of the end of each quarter.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence contradicts the original 30-day payment term, creating an ambiguity. It is now unclear whether THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION has 30 days or only 15 days to remit payment, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The changed text alters the cure period for a breach of contract from thirty (30) days to fifteen (15) days.

This directly conflicts with the original definition. This creates an in-text contradiction about which entities are considered \"Affiliates\" under the agreement, impacting various rights and obligations associated with affiliate status, e.g., indemnification.",

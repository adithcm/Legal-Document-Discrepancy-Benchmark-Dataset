Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all purchase orders exceeding $[*****], payment terms will be net 15 days from the invoice date. All payments shall be made in the currency in which the Price List is quoted for the applicable Purchase Order [*****].",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that standard payment terms are [*****] days, but then specifies a different, shorter payment term of 15 days for larger orders. This creates uncertainty about which payment deadline should be enforced for orders exceeding $[*****].",

Each of the following requirements must be met by Distributor:",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the inventory balance clause. It initially states that the distributor can only return a certain percentage ([*****]%) of the dollar value of products. However, the added sentence contradicts this by stating that the distributor can return up to 100% of the inventory within the first 30 days of the contract. This leads to confusion regarding the actual return policy and the limitations on returns.",

Such Product must be in new and unused condition and in factory sealed boxes.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction concerning the return timeframe for obsolete products. The initial sentence restricts the notification timeframe for obsolete product to be returned to Cisco within [*****].

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be terminable by Licensor at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that Licensor or Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark; by Licensor or Licensee upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party; or by Licensee at any time in the event Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of Licensee's rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Licensee may terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, with no less than thirty (30) days written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the termination rights of the Licensee. Originally, the Licensee could only terminate if they assigned the agreement without consent. Now, an additional clause allows the Licensee to terminate at any time with 30 days' notice, creating uncertainty about the conditions under which the Licensee can terminate.",

For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",

Following termination of this Agreement, Licensee is under no obligation to specify that they are no longer operating under the Licensed Mark.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction. The original clause states that Licensee must specify on public-facing materials for 24 months that they are no longer associated with Licensor, but the new clause removes this obligation entirely, creating confusion about post-termination obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the rights of the third-party beneficiary (Investment Advisor). The original text states that the Investment Advisor has the same rights and protections as the Licensee. However, the added clause now explicitly restricts the Investment Advisor's ability to enforce termination clauses, creating ambiguity about the extent of their rights and protections.",

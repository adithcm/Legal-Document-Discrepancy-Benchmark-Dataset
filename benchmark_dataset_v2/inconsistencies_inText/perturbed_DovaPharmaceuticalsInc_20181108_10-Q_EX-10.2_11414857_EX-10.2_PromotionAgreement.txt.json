Within [***] after the end of each Calendar Quarter during the Term, Dova shall provide to Valeant a written report setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the Net Sales for such Calendar Quarter and the promotion fee payable in respect of such Net Sales in accordance with Section 6.1, including (i) the number of units of the Product shipped from Specialty Pharmacies to patients in the Territory during such Calendar Quarter, together with an itemized list of such units by Target Professional writing the applicable prescription, (ii) the number of units of the Product shipped from Specialty Pharmacies to patients in the Territory based on prescriptions written by the Specialty only during such Calendar Quarter, together with an itemized list of such units by Target Professional in the Specialty writing the applicable prescription (iii) the number of units per shipment of Products (and the number of such shipments) sold by Dova (or its Affiliates or Intermediaries) to the Non-Retail Institutions during such Calendar Quarter, including details respecting which shipments are based on initial orders from such Non-Retail Institutions and which Non-Retail Institutions ordered the Product, (iv) the number of units of the Product shipped from Retail Pharmacies to patients in the Territory during such Calendar Quarter, together with an itemized list of such units by Target Professional writing the applicable prescription, (v) the number of units shipped from Retail Pharmacies to patients based on prescriptions written by the Specialty in the Territory during such Calendar Quarter, together with an itemized list of such units by Target Professional in the Specialty writing the applicable prescription, (vi) the applicable Specialty Fraction for such Calendar Quarter, (vii) the WAC applicable to each dispensable unit, (ix) the Gross to Net Fraction for the applicable period, together with the details respecting the calculation thereof (including details regarding each of the categories of the deductions to gross sales for such Calendar Quarter). Within sixty (60) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter during the Term, Dova shall pay to Valeant the undisputed portion of the promotion fee payable in respect of such Net Sales in accordance with Section 6.1. If this Agreement terminates or expires during a Calendar Quarter, the promotion fee payable to Valeant under Section 6.1 will be calculated only on the Net Sales that occurred during such Calendar Quarter prior to the effective date of such termination or expiration.",

This contradiction introduces uncertainty regarding the actual payment deadline.",

If Valeant does not receive payment of any sum due to it on or before the due date, simple interest shall thereafter accrue on the sum due to Valeant from the due date until the date of payment at the Prime Rate plus [***] or the maximum rate allowable by Applicable Law, whichever is less; provided, however, if it is discovered that any payment is past due as of the result of any audit conduct by Valeant pursuant to Section 7.2, such interest shall not accrue until [***] after the completion of such audit and not at the time the payment was originally due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the reason for any late payment is resulting from or arising out of any act or omission on the part of Valeant, including but not limited to any delay providing the requisite reports in Section 4.2.2, or the payment instructions pursuant to Section 6.3.4, such interest shall not accrue.",

If Valeant does not receive payment of any sum due to it on or before the due date, simple interest shall thereafter accrue on the sum due to Valeant from the due date until the date of payment at a fixed rate of 10% per annum; provided, however, if it is discovered that any payment is past due as of the result of any audit conduct by Valeant pursuant to Section 7.2, such interest shall not accrue until [***] after the completion of such audit and not at the time the payment was originally due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no interest shall accrue on any late payments, regardless of the reason for the delay.",
                "explanation": "Here, the inconsistency arises from multiple alterations. Initially, the interest rate calculation changes from a variable Prime Rate plus [***] to a fixed 10% per annum. More significantly, the addition of \"no interest shall accrue on any late payments, regardless of the reason for the delay\" directly contradicts the earlier statement that interest will accrue, creating ambiguity.",

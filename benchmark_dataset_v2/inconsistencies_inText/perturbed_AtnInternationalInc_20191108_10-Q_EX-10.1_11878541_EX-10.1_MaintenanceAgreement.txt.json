Such invoice for such Cell Site shall be consistent with the AT&T purchase order and detail the Material, Deliverables and Services provided for such Cell Site. The Vendor invoice must specify in detail, if applicable, (i) quantities of each item of Material, Deliverable, and Services, (ii) prices of each item of Material, Deliverable, and Services, (iii) whether the item is taxable and the amount of tax per item, (iv) total amounts for each item, (v) total amount of applicable sales or use taxes, (vi) discounts, if any, (vii) shipping charges, if any, (viii) total amount due, (ix) remit to address, (x) description of Material, Deliverables, and Services, and (xi) special service charges, if any. Each invoice shall specifically reference that the invoice will be paid in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement and all payments for amounts due on such invoice for Material, Deliverables, and Services provided under the Build Addendum will be made in accordance with the Structured Payments Schedule attached as Schedule 3 to the Build Addendum. AT&T will promptly review such invoice and, unless AT&T disputes in good faith the amounts set forth therein, will promptly acknowledge that the Structured Payment set forth therein is due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Build Addendum. In the event that AT&T disputes in good faith any amounts set forth in any such invoice, AT&T shall give written notice of such disputed amounts to Vendor prior to the due date of the first Structure Payment set forth in such invoice. Vendor will provide a payment request to AT&T on a monthly basis on the first day of each calendar month for the Structured Payments set forth in the Build Addendum and the Maintenance Fees set forth in the Maintenance Addendum, in each case as provided in the respective addendum. AT&T shall pay Vendor no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of such monthly payment request for Structured Payments. AT&T shall pay, or provide a written notice of any good faith dispute to, Vendor no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of an invoice for Maintenance Fees. Any dispute of an invoice for Maintenance Fees shall be made by AT&T in good faith and shall set forth in writing a detailed description of the disputed amounts and the reason for such dispute. Notwithstanding any good faith dispute, AT&T shall pay all undisputed amounts in full to Vendor no later than the due date for such invoice. Invoices received by AT&T more than one (1) year after the Delivery of Material and Deliverables or the provision of Services are untimely and AT&T has no obligation to pay such invoices.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 60-day payment term for Structured Payments and 90-day for Maintenance Fees. This change modifies those terms, creating a conflict. The Structured Payments term becomes 90 days, and the Maintenance Fees are shortened to 30 days. This results in a direct contradiction within the same clause, which creates an uncertainty regarding when AT&T must pay each invoice type. A 30 day term for maintainence fee also feels not economically viable.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states a 60-day payment term for structured payments. The new injected sentence introduces a contradiction by stipulating 30 days with a vaguely specified exception based on a future side letter. This in-text contradiction creates immediate ambiguity regarding the actual payment term and provides no details of what that is, introducing dispute, uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The change causes a contradiction within the clause.

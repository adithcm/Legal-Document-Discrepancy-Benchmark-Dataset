                "original_text": "A. Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement on the days and times and in the manner therein appointed for payment thereof.",
                "changed_text": "A. Guarantors shall pay or cause to be paid to Franchisor all undisputed monies payable by Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement within 30 days of receipt of invoice, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by Franchisor. Disputed amounts will be resolved per the dispute resolution process outlined in Section X of the Master Franchise Agreement, and payment will be due within 10 days of resolution.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment terms. The original clause states that guarantors must pay according to the terms of the Master Franchise Agreement. The modified clause introduces a 30-day payment window and a separate process for disputed amounts, creating uncertainty about which payment terms apply and when payments are definitively due.",

                "original_text": "E. Without affecting the Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor, without notice to the Guarantors, may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Guarantors waive notice of amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement and notice of demand for payment or performance by Master Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "E. Without affecting the Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor, without notice to the Guarantors, may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee up to a maximum of 30 days, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Any extensions, modifications, or releases exceeding 30 days require written consent from the Guarantors. Guarantors waive notice of amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement and notice of demand for payment or performance by Master Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Franchisor's ability to modify the Master Franchisee's obligations. The original clause grants the Franchisor unlimited power to modify obligations without notice. The modified clause limits this power to 30 days, requiring consent for longer periods. This creates a conflict about the extent of the Guarantors' exposure and under what circumstances their consent is required.",

                "original_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated. In the event of any conflict of law, the laws of such state shall prevail, without regard to the application of such state's conflict of law rules. If, however, any provision of this Guarantee would not be enforceable under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and if the Master Franchisee's franchised business is located outside of such state and such provision would be enforceable under the laws of the state in which the Master Franchisee's franchised business is located, then such provision shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of that state. Any action brought to enforce or interpret this Guarantee in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the county and state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and Guarantors hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
                "changed_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which the Master Franchisee's franchised business is primarily located, regardless of the Franchisor's principal place of business. In the event of any dispute, mediation shall be the first course of action, occurring in the county where the Master Franchisee's franchised business is located, before any legal action can be initiated. The laws of that state shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Guarantee.",
                "explanation": "The original clause dictates the Franchisor's principal place of business state law. The modified clause dictates the Master Franchisee's principal business location. This is an in-text contradiction on governing law. In addition, the original clause says that the Guarantors waive jurisdiction, yet the modified clause dictates where mediation shall occur. It is unclear if the waiver is still in full effect, as well as if mediation is required before litigation.",

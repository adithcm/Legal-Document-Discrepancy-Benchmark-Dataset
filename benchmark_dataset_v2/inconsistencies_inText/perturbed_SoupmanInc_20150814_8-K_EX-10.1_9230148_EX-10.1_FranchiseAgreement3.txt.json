Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. Initially, the agreement states that non-binding mediation will occur in New York with costs shared. The addition allows the franchisor to force binding arbitration in California at the franchisee's expense for IP disputes. This creates uncertainty and a clear conflict as to where and how disputes are to be resolved, and who pays.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding the effectiveness of a general release. The initial statement acknowledges that California law voids waivers of rights under the Franchise Investment Law and Franchise Relations Act. The added clause then states that signing the release *does* constitute a full waiver of all claims, including those specifically protected by California law. This creates uncertainty about the legal effect of the release and introduces a legal conflict.",

Under California Civil Code Section 1671, certain liquidated damages clauses are unenforceable.\n\nHowever, the parties agree that the liquidated damages clause is a reasonable estimate of the actual damages that would be incurred by the franchisor in the event of a breach by the franchisee, and therefore the clause is fully enforceable regardless of California Civil Code Section 1671.",
                "explanation": "The original text acknowledges that certain liquidated damages clauses are unenforceable under California law. The added text then declares that *this specific* liquidated damages clause is fully enforceable, directly contradicting the statement about unenforceability under California law. This creates a conflict regarding whether the clause is enforceable or not, leading to potential disputes.",

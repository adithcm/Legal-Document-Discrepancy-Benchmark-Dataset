When requesting payment of relevant contract price from Party A, Party B has to:\n\n(1) provide official invoices that are in compliance with the requirements of State tax laws by the 25t h of the second month (Party B, instead of any of its affiliates, shall be the invoice issuer);\n\n(2) provide the payment request confirmed by the Parties; and\n\n(3) pay the performance bond as required in Article 6 hereof.",
                "changed_text": "7.6 The Parties shall settle the payment every month, and the initial settlement period shall be the end of the third month, which means that the information service fee generated in the first month shall be paid to the account of the partner by the end of the third month.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment terms. While the original clause specifies a settlement period ending at the end of the third month, the added text allows Party A to delay payment for up to six months at its discretion. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline and potentially leads to disputes.",

However, Party A reserves the right to retain the performance bond indefinitely should any potential future claims arise against Party B, as determined by Party A's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates conflicting terms regarding the refund of the performance bond. The original text dictates a specific timeframe (within two years of termination), while the altered text grants Party A the right to retain the bond indefinitely based on potential future claims. This ambiguity undermines the clarity of the refund process and introduces uncertainty regarding when, if ever, Party B will receive its performance bond back.",

All original terms will apply during these extensions, unless otherwise notified by Party A in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the agreement can be automatically renewed for one year if neither party objects. The added clause gives Party A the unilateral right to extend the agreement for up to five years, regardless of Party B's consent. This directly contradicts the mutual agreement implied by the original renewal clause, causing uncertainty about the actual term of the contract and Party B's rights regarding termination or renegotiation.",

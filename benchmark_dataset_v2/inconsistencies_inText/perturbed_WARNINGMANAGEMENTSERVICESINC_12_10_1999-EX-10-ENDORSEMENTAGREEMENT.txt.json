(a) Within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of each Contract Year Quarter, Company shall deliver to Pey Dirt an itemized statement setting forth the total shipments of Endorsed Products during said Contract Year Quarter and, at the same time, shall pay to Pey Dirt a royalty with respect to such shipments as hereinafter provided.  Such royalties shall be based upon the actual invoice price of such shipments, exclusive only of shipping charges and sales taxes, and shall be at the rate of 8.5% of the total of said invoice prices with a minimum invoice price of $2.50 per box.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by specifying a 30-day payment deadline for all Contract Year Quarters, but then providing a different payment deadline (60 days) for the first Contract Year Quarter. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the actual payment terms for the initial quarter.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in Section 6(a) regarding interest on late payments. The original clause states that past due payments shall bear interest at a defined rate. However, the added sentence states that no interest will be charged if the late payment is made within 5 business days of the due date. This creates uncertainty regarding the circumstances under which interest will be charged on late payments.",

In order to be a sufficient notice hereunder, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default and shall specify the provision of this Agreement which applies to each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party must take in order to cure each such item of default. The termination rights set forth in this section shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the nondefaulting party hereunder, however, and if default is made by either party hereunder, the other may resort to such other remedies as said party would have been entitled to if this section had been omitted from this Agreement.  Termination under the provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims which the terminating party may otherwise have against the defaulting party.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction within the default clause. It initially specifies a 10-day cure period for payment defaults after written notice. However, it then adds a provision that extends the cure period to 20 days if the default is due to unforeseen technical issues. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes regarding the applicable cure period, as 'unforeseen technical issues' is subjective and open to interpretation.",

One part of the sentence states the payment is due on the 5th, while the added sentence provides a 15-day grace period, creating uncertainty about the actual due date and potential late fee application.",

The added sentence states that the client can request an audit every quarter during the term. This creates a contradiction because both statement are mutually exclusive.",

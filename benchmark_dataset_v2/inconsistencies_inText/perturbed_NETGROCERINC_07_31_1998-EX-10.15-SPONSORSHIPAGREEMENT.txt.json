NetGrocer will pay the remainder of the monthly installments on or prior to the fifteenth day of each of the next eight (8) calendar months.",

NetGrocer will pay the remainder of the monthly installments on or prior to the thirtieth day of each of the next eight (8) calendar months.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying the 15th day of the month for initial payments, but the 30th day of the month for subsequent payments, creating ambiguity on the payment deadline. It makes unclear which date is the deadline for payment.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the payment deadline after termination. Section 8(c) now states 15 days, while other sections imply different payment timelines based on monthly installments, creating confusion.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation shortens the prior notice for audits from 30 to 15 days and changes the discrepancy threshold from 5% to 10%. This creates an in-text contradiction on audit notification timelines and the threshold for fee responsibility.",

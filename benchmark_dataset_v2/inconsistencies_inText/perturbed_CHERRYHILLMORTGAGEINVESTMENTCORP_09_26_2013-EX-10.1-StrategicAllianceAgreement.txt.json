                "original_text": "Section 5. Term and Termination.\n\n(a) Unless earlier terminated as provided below, this Agreement shall remain in effect until the later to occur of the date that is (x) three (3) years from the date hereof and (y) the date on which an affiliate of Freedom Mortgage is not acting as the external manager of Cherry Hill.",
                "changed_text": "Section 5. Term and Termination.\n\n(a) Unless earlier terminated as provided below, this Agreement shall remain in effect until the date that is three (3) years from the date hereof.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding section 5(a), this agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term. The agreement can also be terminated by either party with 60 days written notice for any reason.",
                "explanation": "The original Section 5(a) specifies a term of three years, potentially extended. The added section 5(b) introduces conflicting terms by allowing for automatic one-year renewals unless a 30-day notice is provided. Additionally, it adds a clause that either party may terminate the agreement with 60 days' written notice, regardless of the initial three-year term or the condition in the original section 5(a)(y). This creates uncertainty about the actual duration of the agreement and the conditions under which it can be terminated.",

Miscellaneous.\n\n(f) The Parties may (i) amend this Agreement, (ii) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other Party, (iii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (iv) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party, but such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.",

Miscellaneous.\n\n(f) The Parties may (i) amend this Agreement, (ii) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other Party, (iii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (iv) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Freedom Mortgage reserves the right to unilaterally amend Exhibit A and Exhibit B without the consent of Cherry Hill, provided that such amendment does not materially alter the economics of the agreement to the detriment of Cherry Hill. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party, but such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.",
                "explanation": "The original Section 6(f) states that the agreement may not be amended except by a written instrument signed by both parties. The added sentence creates an in-text contradiction by allowing Freedom Mortgage to unilaterally amend Exhibit A and Exhibit B, provided the economics are not materially altered to the detriment of Cherry Hill. This contradicts the earlier statement requiring mutual agreement for amendments, and introduces ambiguity. The phrase 'materially alter the economics of the agreement to the detriment of Cherry Hill' is also subjective and open to interpretation, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original Section 6(g) specifies that New York law governs the entire agreement. The added subsection (k) introduces a contradiction by stating that disputes related to mortgage loan servicing are governed by New Jersey law. This creates ambiguity as to which state's laws apply to specific disputes, potentially leading to conflicts and uncertainty in legal proceedings.",

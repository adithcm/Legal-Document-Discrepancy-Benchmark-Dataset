Party B shall pay one-month freight as liquidated damages in case of termination of the Agreement without consent. Within the contract period, Party B shall not charge the freight difference if Party A rents same-level vehicles. Party B shall also compensate Party A's other losses.",

Party B shall pay one-month freight as liquidated damages in case of termination of the Agreement without consent. Within the contract period, Party B shall not charge the freight difference if Party A rents same-level vehicles. Party B shall not be required to compensate Party A's other losses.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating in the same section that Party B *shall* compensate Party A's other losses and then immediately stating that Party B *shall not* be required to compensate Party A's other losses in the case of early termination. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the financial obligations of Party B upon early termination.",

Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB500 per trip on the first working day, RMB1,000 per trip on the second working day and RMB2,000 per trip on the third working day (based on the time records on the parcel transfer documents) and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month's freight. In the special event of changes to route and time and severe weather (or other force majeure events), Party B shall be in touch with Party A in time and record such special event on the parcel transfer documents with Party A's approval.",

In the special event of changes to route and time and severe weather (or other force majeure events), Party B will not be penalized for delays and is not responsible for contacting Party A.",
                "explanation": "The original text says that Party B will pay liquidated damages for delays, but then in the case of severe weather events, there are conditions where they *can* avoid said damages if certain steps are taken. I've added a contradiction that in the special event cases, the Party B is not responsible. This means it is unclear whether the liquidated damages still apply in special events. This introduces an in-text contradiction around payment for parcel delays.",

The original states Party A *shall not* prejudice its right, while the modified text indicates Party A *shall* prejudice its right, causing confusion over whether Party A can seek damages after termination.",

If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer's rights under this Agreement. If any payment required to be made under this Agreement is not made within twenty (20) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the \"Late Payment Date\"), interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made at a quarterly rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Three-Month U.S. dollar LIBOR (Reuters Page LIBOR01) on the Late Payment Date (or the next Business Day if such Late Payment Date is not a Business Day), and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law.

The original text suggests that Parties should reasonably consider the JAC's views, implying some level of influence or importance. By stating that Parties are *not* required to take these opinions into account, the changed text directly contradicts the initial implication. This creates uncertainty regarding the role and impact of the JAC's advice and introduces possible friction in how decisions are made.",

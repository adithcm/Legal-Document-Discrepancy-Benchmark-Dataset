                "original_text": "Any payments due under this Agreement which are not paid by the date such payments are due under this Agreement shall bear interest to the extent permitted by applicable law at the U.S. prime rate per annum quoted in the \"Money Rates\" column of The Wall Street Journal (U.S., Western Edition) on the first business day after such payment is due, plus an additional [ * ], calculated on the number of days such payment is delinquent.",
                "changed_text": "Any payments due under this Agreement which are not paid by the date such payments are due under this Agreement shall bear interest to the extent permitted by applicable law at the U.S. prime rate per annum quoted in the \"Money Rates\" column of The Wall Street Journal (U.S., Western Edition) on the first business day after such payment is due, plus an additional [ * ], calculated on the number of days such payment is delinquent. Any payments due under this Agreement which are not paid by the date such payments are due under this Agreement will not accrue any additional interest and there will be no penalties for any late payment.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding the application of interest on late payments. One sentence states that late payments will accrue interest, while the added sentence states that late payments will not accrue interest. This creates uncertainty regarding the payment terms and could lead to disputes over contractual obligations.",

Concurrently with making such report, Astellas shall remit payment to FG for any payments due under this Agreement.",

Astellas shall remit payment to FG for any payments due under this Agreement within thirty (30) days of the end of each quarter, irrespective of report submission.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that payment should be remitted 'concurrently' with the quarterly report. The changed text introduces a fixed 30-day deadline for payment after each quarter, regardless of when the report is submitted. This creates a conflict: payment could be required *before* the report is even due, or, if the report is submitted late, the payment deadline is effectively shortened. The contradiction creates uncertainty about the payment schedule and responsibilities of Astellas.",

Astellas is not obligated to spend more than $[*] annually for development",
                "explanation": "First sentence changes the type of effort to 'best efforts', which is a stronger commitment. Second, added a conflicting sentence that limits the amount that Astellas has to spend. Even if 'best efforts' are required, Astellas is not obligated to spend more than $[*] amount. This is an in-text contradiction that reduces obligations due to the maximum threshold.",

In the absence of a specific payment schedule, all payment terms are 30 days net from date of invoice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all projects initiated after January 1, 2025, payment terms shall be net 60 days from the date of invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that payment terms are generally 30 days, but then specifies a 60-day payment term for projects starting after a certain date. This creates ambiguity about which payment terms apply, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states no transfer of IP, but the addition now grants joint ownership of jointly developed IP, which implicitly transfers rights. This contradicts the original intent and creates uncertainty about IP ownership.",

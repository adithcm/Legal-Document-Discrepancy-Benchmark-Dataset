The Executive's salary shall accrue from day to day, shall be payable in equal monthly instalments in arrears on or about the 15th day of each month.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by specifying the salary payment date as the 15th of each month, while the original states 'on or about the last day of each month.' This creates ambiguity regarding the precise payment deadline, leading to potential disputes.",

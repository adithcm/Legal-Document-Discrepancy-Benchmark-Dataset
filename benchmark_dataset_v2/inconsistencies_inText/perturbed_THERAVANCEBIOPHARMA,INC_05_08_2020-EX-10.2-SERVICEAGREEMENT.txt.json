                "original_text": "7.1 The Executive shall be paid a basic salary of £448,903 per annum subject to deductions required by law. The Executive's salary shall accrue from day to day, shall be payable in equal monthly instalments in arrears on or about the last day of each month.",
                "changed_text": "7.1 The Executive shall be paid a basic salary of £448,903 per annum subject to deductions required by law. The Executive's salary shall accrue from day to day, shall be payable in equal monthly instalments in arrears on or about the 15th day of each month.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction. Originally, salary payments were due on or about the last day of the month. Now, payments are due on or about the 15th, conflicting with the prior clause. This creates uncertainty regarding the payment deadline, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The fraction used to calculate the deduction for excess holiday taken on termination is changed from 1/260 to 1/250. This creates a conflict in how the overpayment is calculated, leading to ambiguity and potential disputes on termination.",

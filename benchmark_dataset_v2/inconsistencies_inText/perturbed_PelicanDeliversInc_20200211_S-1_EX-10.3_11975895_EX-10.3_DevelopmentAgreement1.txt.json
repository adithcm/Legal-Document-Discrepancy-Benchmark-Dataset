                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. While the initial payment schedule outlines 5 payments of 20% each tied to specific milestones, the addition of two subsequent payments of 10% each creates uncertainty about the complete payment structure. This contradicts the initial explicit agreement on the payment schedule and the total percentage to be paid at each stage.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes the deposit amount from 20% to 10%. This directly contradicts the following payment milestones which are calculated based on a 20% installment, thus creating a mismatch between the initial deposit and the remaining payments. This creates ambiguity around the amount of the deposit.",

                "explanation": "This alteration introduces a conflict: the original text states that users won't be charged if no drivers are available, while the modified text imposes a 5% service fee in the same situation. This directly contradicts the initial condition of not being charged. This creates ambiguity around the charging policy.",

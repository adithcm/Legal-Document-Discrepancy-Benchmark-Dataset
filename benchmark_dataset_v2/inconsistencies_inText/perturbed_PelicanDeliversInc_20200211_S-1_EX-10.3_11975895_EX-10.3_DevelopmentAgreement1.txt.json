                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. Section 4 outlines the payment schedule tied to milestone completion. The added text at the end of the same section states that if a milestone is missed, the client will get a 5% credit of the total project fees. This creates ambiguity: Does the developer still get paid for a milestone if it's late, and the client gets a credit, or is payment contingent upon on-time delivery despite the credit clause? This contradicts the payment schedule laid out and creates an enforcement issue.",

We estimate that the website (Customer Portal) will take 3 months to complete because this will be the priority.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the project timeline. Initially, Section 3 states an estimate of six months, acknowledging potential changes. This is a projection. The change makes the timeline a guarantee, and it imposes a penalty for delays. However, the existing text that \"This estimate may change depending on unforeseen circumstances or requirements\" from the original text directly contradicts the guarantee, creating uncertainty about whether the penalty applies if unforeseen circumstances cause delays. The client could try to enforce a penalty, but the developer can invoke the exception clause.",

                "explanation": "This adds a condition to the Milestone #1 payment. While the original schedule dictates payment upon milestone completion, the altered version makes payment for Milestone #1 subject to client approval. This creates ambiguity.

The US Approval Payments, EU Approval Payments and Japan/China Approval Payments to SFJ will be due as of the applicable annual anniversary of the date of the applicable Regulatory Approval. SFJ shall deliver invoices to PB for the US Approval Payments, EU Approval Payments and Japan/China Approval Payments at least [***] before the applicable anniversary of the date of Regulatory Approval, and such payments will be made by PB on or before the later of (a) [***] and (b) [***] following delivery of such invoices, by wire transfer to SFJ's account that SFJ shall designate on such invoice. PB will provide SFJ with written notice of each wire transfer to SFJ's account. All amounts payable and calculations under this Agreement shall be in US dollars.",

This conflicting information creates ambiguity about the precise payment deadline for Chinese regulatory approval payments, potentially leading to disputes.",

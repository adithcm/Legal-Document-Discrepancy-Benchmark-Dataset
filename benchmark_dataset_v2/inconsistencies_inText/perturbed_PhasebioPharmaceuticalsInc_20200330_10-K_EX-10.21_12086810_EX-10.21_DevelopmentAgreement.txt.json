                "explanation": "The amendment introduces an in-text contradiction by changing how the SFJ Final Management Fee is factored into calculating PB Costs. Initially, the full SFJ Final Management Fee was subtracted. Now, only half is subtracted. This contradiction creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the amount SFJ is obligated to pay PB. Uncertainty is created due to the different definition of elected total amount. This will create disputes over payments, which is the conflict.",

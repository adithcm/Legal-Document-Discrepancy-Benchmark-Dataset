If MBE is unable, despite its commercially reasonable efforts, to facilitate the execution of such an agreement with one or more carriers, the Basic Fee shall be paid by each MBE Center directly pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "MBE agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to execute agreements, or to facilitate the execution of agreements among the appropriate parties, so that such Basic Fee is paid to the Company directly from the carrier which ships such package no later than thirty (30) days following the end of the month in which such package was shipped. If MBE is unable, despite its commercially reasonable efforts, to facilitate the execution of such an agreement with one or more carriers, the Basic Fee shall be paid by each MBE Center directly pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding the payment deadline for the Basic Fee. The original text states that the fee should be paid within 15 days following the end of the month, while the modified text extends the deadline to 30 days. This introduces ambiguity as to when payment is actually due.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes the payment deadline for custom software development costs from 30 days to 60 days post-invoice. This conflicts with potential implications from other sections which assume the standard 30-day payment terms are consistently applied throughout the agreement.",

                "explanation": "This change extends the grace period for payment defaults by MBE Centers from 30 days to 45 days before the Company can exercise its rights to terminate service or offset payments. This creates conflict and confusion given that the general assumption is of 30 day period given the other perturbations. The modified section will create disputes.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "12.3 This Agreement will terminate automatically upon written notice from Transporter in the event Shipper fails to pay all of the amount of any bill for service rendered by Transporter hereunder in accord with the terms and conditions of Article VI of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff.",
                "changed_text": "12.3 This Agreement will terminate automatically upon written notice from Transporter in the event Shipper fails to pay all of the amount of any bill for service rendered by Transporter hereunder in accord with the terms and conditions of Article VI of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff. However, failure to pay shall not result in automatic termination if Shipper makes a good faith effort to dispute the charges within 30 days of the invoice date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause states automatic termination for non-payment. The modified clause adds a condition that prevents automatic termination if a good faith dispute is initiated. This creates uncertainty about when the agreement can be automatically terminated and under what circumstances, conflicting with the initial automatic termination clause.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 90 days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "This modification adds a renewal clause that directly contradicts the explicitly stated termination date. The original clause sets a definite end date. The added clause allows for automatic yearly renewals, creating uncertainty about the actual term of the agreement and conflicting with the initial termination date.",

Either Party may, without relieving itself of its obligation under this Agreement, assignment any of its rights hereunder to a company with which it is affiliated. Otherwise, Shipper shall not assign this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder, except in accord with Article III, Section 11 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff.",
                "changed_text": "14.1 Either Party may assign or pledge this Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder under the provisions of any mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, or other instrument which it has executed or may execute hereafter as security for indebtedness. Either Party may, without relieving itself of its obligation under this Agreement, assignment any of its rights hereunder to a company with which it is affiliated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shipper shall have the right to freely assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of Transporter.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts the assignment restriction placed on the Shipper. The original clause restricts the Shipper's ability to assign the agreement to third parties. The modified clause gives the Shipper free reign to assign the agreement as they see fit without the permission of the transporter. This introduces uncertainty in what situations and if assignment is allowed.",

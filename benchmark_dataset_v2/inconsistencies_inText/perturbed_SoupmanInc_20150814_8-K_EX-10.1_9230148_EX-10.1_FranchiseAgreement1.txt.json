The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the fifteenth(15 th ) day of each calendar month based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar month.\n\n4.2.2 You shall pay to us a franchise sales royalty fee (the \"Franchise Sales Royalty Fee\") for each Unit Franchise you sell in the Master Territory as follows: twenty-five percent (25%) of the initial franchise fee collected from each Unit Franchisee upon execution of the Unit Franchisee's Franchise Agreement (a \"Unit Franchise Agreement\"); provided, however, that if you elect to discount or reduce an initial franchise fee for any reason, the Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be payable to us as if the full initial franchise fee had been paid. The Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us at the same time and in the same manner as the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee provided in Section 4.2.1 above. Any Royalty Fee you collect from the Franchisee shall be immediately paid to Us, but no later than the fifteen (15  th ) day of each calendar month. A Unit Franchise shall be deemed to be sold to a Unit Franchisee on the date that you and the Unit Franchisee execute the Unit Franchise Agreement, irrespective of when the Unit Franchise begins operation. Fees and Royalties cannot be increased or decreased without our prior written consent.",

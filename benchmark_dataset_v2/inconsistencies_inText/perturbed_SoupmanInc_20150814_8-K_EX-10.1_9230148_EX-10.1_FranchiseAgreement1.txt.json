                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the franchisee *is* entitled to set-off any payments required to be made under this Section 4 against any monetary claim they may have against the franchisor. The original text said that the franchisee *is not* entitled to this. Because these statements are in the same section, they contradict each other and create an ambiguity in enforcement.",

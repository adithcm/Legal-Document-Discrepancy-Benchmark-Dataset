                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by altering the payment deadline for the energy saving service fee. The original text specifies payment by the 15th of each month, while the modified text requires payment by the 10th of each month. This creates ambiguity about the actual due date and could lead to disputes over late payment penalties.",

For the amount of electricity generated up to 800 million KWH after the project is put into operation, it shall be charged of the energy saving service fee at 0.40 RMB/KWH. After 800 million KWH, it shall be charged energy saving service fee with the rate of 0.20 RMB/KWH. The term of the agreement is 20 years, during which if any main equipment of any Party stops operation due to technical problem or at the end of its life cycle, the agreement shall be automatically terminated. In case of that happens, the Party B will have the full rights to dispose the system of Party A.",

After 800 million KWH, it shall be charged energy saving service fee with the rate of 0.20 RMB/KWH. The term of the agreement is 20 years, during which the agreement will continue regardless of equipment failures. In case of equipment failure, the Parties will meet to renegotiate.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction concerning the agreement's term and termination conditions. The original text dictates automatic termination upon failure of any main equipment of either party. The edited text stipulates the contract will continue regardless of equipment failures, with renegotiation in case of failure. This creates ambiguity on whether failure of equipment terminates the agreement or not.",

Party A has priority to develop further recycling energy projects for Party B. Party B is not obligated to use Party A for any further recycling energy projects.",
                "explanation": "The modified text adds a contradictory statement asserting that Party B is not obligated to use Party A for future projects, directly conflicting with the original statement granting Party A priority. This introduces uncertainty regarding Party A's right to first refusal and potentially leads to disputes over future project development.",

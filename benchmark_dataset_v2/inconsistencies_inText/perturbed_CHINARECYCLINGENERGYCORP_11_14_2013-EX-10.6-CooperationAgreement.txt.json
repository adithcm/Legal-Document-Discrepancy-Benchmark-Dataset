                "original_text": "4. The settlement date is the first day of the next month. Deducting the dues of Party A, Party B should pay Party A the energy saving service fee of the last month before the 15t h of each month.",
                "changed_text": "4. The settlement date is the first day of the next month. Deducting the dues of Party A, Party B should pay Party A the energy saving service fee of the last month before the 15t h of each month.\n\nAlternatively, Party B may choose to pay the energy saving service fee within 45 days of the invoice date, without incurring any late payment penalties.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. Initially, Party B is required to pay by the 15th of each month. The added sentence allows Party B to pay within 45 days of the invoice date, potentially conflicting with the original deadline and creating uncertainty about when payment is actually due and whether penalties apply. This allows two different interpretations which is more beneficial to Party B which would bring inconsistencies in the contract.",

The term of the agreement is 20 years, during which if any main equipment of any Party stops operation due to technical problem or at the end of its life cycle, the agreement shall be automatically terminated.

The term of the agreement is 20 years, during which if any main equipment of any Party stops operation due to technical problem or at the end of its life cycle, the agreement shall be automatically terminated. In case of that happens, the Party B will have the full rights to dispose the system of Party A.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the agreement can only be terminated with mutual written consent of both parties, regardless of equipment failure.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies automatic termination under certain equipment failure conditions, while the added text states that termination requires mutual written consent regardless of such failures. This creates a direct contradiction on the grounds for termination. There is a question of whether the contract can be terminated automatically when the primary equipment fails, or is the consent from both parties required. The addition of new statement, introduces in-text contradiction and a legal dispute.",

Party A can enforce the Performance Guarantee by Party B to take all project assets. Party B shall pay the actual energy saving service fees at once and pay Party A losses.",
                "changed_text": "2.2 If the delay is over 60 days, it is regarded that Party B has no ability to perform its payment obligation. Party A can enforce the Performance Guarantee by Party B to take all project assets. Party B shall pay the actual energy saving service fees at once and pay Party A losses.\n\nHowever, if Party B provides a written notice explaining the delay due to unforeseen financial circumstances and a plan for repayment within 90 days, Party A shall postpone enforcement for the given period.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates that if payment is delayed over 60 days, Party A can enforce the performance guarantee and seize assets. The added text introduces an exception: if Party B explains the delay and proposes a repayment plan, Party A must postpone enforcement. This creates a contradiction regarding Party A's right to enforce the guarantee immediately after 60 days of delay, potentially leading to disputes over when enforcement is permissible. Party B will now have more negotiation, and the terms of the contract is at dispute.",

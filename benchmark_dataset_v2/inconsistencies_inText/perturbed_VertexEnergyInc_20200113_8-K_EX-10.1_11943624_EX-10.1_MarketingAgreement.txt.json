                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from three to thirty business days directly contradicts the later clause. This creates confusion as to when payment is actually due and when late fees should apply, since Section 4.5 references 'the due date'.",

Payment for any amounts due in accordance with the above shall be made within three (3) Business Days after the date of the applicable detailed ledger Statement.

The Parties shall endeavor to resolve any disputes promptly, and the disputed amount found due, if any, plus accrued interest at the Interest Rate shall be paid within three (3) Business Days following resolution of the dispute. All payments under the terms of this Agreement shall be made in US Dollars and immediately available funds. The Parties shall net all undisputed amounts due and owing on the same day, and/or past due, arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other Party. Interest on late payments shall accrue at the Interest Rate from the due date until the date of payment.",

Payment for any amounts due in accordance with the above shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of the applicable detailed ledger Statement. If any detailed ledger State- ment is disputed in good faith, the Party owing money will pay the undisputed portion by the due date and will by such due date provide a written explanation of the basis for the disputed portion to such due date. The Parties shall endeavor to resolve any disputes promptly, and the disputed amount found due, if any, plus accrued interest at the Interest Rate shall be paid within five (5) Business Days following resolution of the dispute. All payments under the terms of this Agreement shall be made in US Dollars and immediately available funds. The Parties shall net all undisputed amounts due and owing on the same day, and/or past due, arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other Party. Interest on late payments shall accrue at a fixed amount of $1000 from the due date until the date of payment.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment term from three to fifteen business days in Section 4.5 creates a direct conflict with the payment term specified in the modified Section 4.1, as well as making the interest on late payments a fixed amount instead of accruing at an Interest Rate. Additionally, the period to pay the disputed amount found due is changed to five days. This leads to uncertainty about the actual payment schedule and calculations for the amount due.",

                "explanation": "Changing the cure period for payment failure from three to ten business days directly conflicts with sections 4.1 and 4.5.

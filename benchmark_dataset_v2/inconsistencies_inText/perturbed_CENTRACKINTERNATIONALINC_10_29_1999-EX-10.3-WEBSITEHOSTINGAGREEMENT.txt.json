                "original_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "changed_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. However, the Customer shall have until the 15th day of the month to remit payment without penalty. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by initially stating payment is due by the 5th of the month, then providing a grace period until the 15th before penalties apply. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline and potential disputes about late fees.",

This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that a 15-day notice is required before the end of the initial or renewal term to prevent automatic renewal. The modified text changes the notice period to 30 days, creating a direct contradiction and uncertainty about the required notice period, potentially leading to disputes over contract renewal.",

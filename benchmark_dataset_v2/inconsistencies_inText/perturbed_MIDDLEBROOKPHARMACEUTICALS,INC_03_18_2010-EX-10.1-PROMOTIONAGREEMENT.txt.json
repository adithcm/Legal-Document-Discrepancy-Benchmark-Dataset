                "original_text": "5.5. The Promotion Fees shall be paid to DD by MBRK fifteen (15) days after the receipt of an invoice from DD by  MBRK.",
                "changed_text": "5.5. The Promotion Fees shall be paid to DD by MBRK fifteen (15) days after the receipt of an invoice from DD by  MBRK.\n\n5.5.1 Notwithstanding the above, for the first three months of this agreement, all promotion fees will be due and payable within 60 days of MBRK receiving the invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that promotion fees are due within 15 days of invoice receipt in section 5.5, but then adds section 5.5.1 which extends this payment deadline to 60 days for the initial three months. This inconsistency creates uncertainty as to which payment term applies during the first quarter of the agreement, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "Section 11.2 states that all Intellectual Property Rights for promotional materials are the exclusive property of MBRK. However, the added clause 11.2.1 grants DD a non-exclusive license to use these same materials, creating a direct contradiction. This creates uncertainty about ownership and usage rights of the promotional materials.",

                "explanation": "Section 18(a) requires a 30-day notice period for termination due to breach, allowing the breaching party time to cure the breach. However, the added section 18(g) allows MBRK to terminate the agreement immediately for failure to meet performance metrics, without any cure period. This creates an inconsistency in the termination process, specifically regarding the notice period and opportunity to cure, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. Section 5.5 originally stated that Promotion Fees should be paid within fifteen (15) days of invoice receipt. The modification changes this to forty-five (45) days, creating uncertainty about the actual payment deadline. This could lead to disputes over late payment penalties or interest.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by providing conflicting timelines. First the meeting to determine any adjustment to the deposit has to happen within 5 days but later its written that it has to happen within 15 days. Then, the deposit must be increased within 10 days but later is written that it must be increased within 5 days. This creates uncertainty about the actual deadlines.",

Each such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the specifics of the breach.",

Each such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the specifics of the breach.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the number of days' written notice required to terminate the agreement from thirty (30) days to sixty (60) days, creating ambiguity.

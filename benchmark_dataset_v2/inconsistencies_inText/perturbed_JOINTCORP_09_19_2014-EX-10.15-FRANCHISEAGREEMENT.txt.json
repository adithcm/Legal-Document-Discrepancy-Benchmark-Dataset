All Royalty Fees, Advertising Fees, amounts due from you for purchases from us or our affiliates, and other amounts which you owe us or our affiliates (unless otherwise provided for in a separate agreement between us or our affiliates) will begin to accrue interest after their respective due dates at the lesser of (i) the highest commercial contract interest rate permitted by state law, and (ii) the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum. In addition to any accruing interest, all late payments will incur a late charge of Fifty and No/100 Dollars ($50.00) per day until the payment is made. Payments due us or our affiliates will not be deemed received until such time as funds from the deposit of any check by us or our affiliates is collected from your account. You acknowledge that the inclusion of this Paragraph in this Agreement does not mean we agree to accept or condone late payments, nor does it indicate that we have any intention to extend credit to, or otherwise finance your operation of the Franchise. We have the right to require that any payments due us or our affiliates be made by certified or cashier's check in the event that any payment by check is not honored by the bank upon which the check is drawn. We also reserve the right to charge you a fee of One Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($100.00) for any payment by check that is not honored by the bank upon which it is drawn.",

                "changed_text": "4.1 PC Financial shall pay a monthly Fee to Mobimagic in accordance with this Agreement and within the timeline as permitted under the prevailing India regulations. Notwithstanding the above, all payments exceeding $100,000 USD shall be subject to a 90-day payment term.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment timelines. The original clause states payment should be within the timeline permitted under prevailing Indian regulations, while the modified clause adds a condition that payments exceeding $100,000 USD are subject to a 90-day term. This is inconsistent with the general payment term, creating ambiguity about which term applies.",

After PC Financial confirms that invoice contents are correct, PC Financial shall pay within 60 days after confirming thus.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the payment deadline. Originally, payment was to be made 'within 45 days after confirming' the invoice. The modified version changes this to 'within 60 days after confirming thus'. This introduces direct ambiguity about the specific deadline for payments and creates a conflict.",

                "explanation": "The clause modifies the cure period for a material breach. Initially, a breach needed to be remedied within thirty (30) days to avoid termination. The modified version extends this period to forty-five (45) days, creating inconsistency about the allowed timeframe to cure a breach and potential disputes over valid termination.",

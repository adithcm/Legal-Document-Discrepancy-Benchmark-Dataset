These payments shall be made in installments according to the schedule set forth in Exhibit A hereto. Notwithstanding the schedule in Exhibit A, the Client reserves the right to withhold up to 20% of each installment payment if not satisfied with the current progress of the application, to be determined at the Client's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment schedule. While Section 2 states that payments will follow the schedule in Exhibit A, it also introduces an option for the Client to unilaterally withhold a portion of the payment based on subjective satisfaction. This contradicts the agreed-upon payment schedule and introduces uncertainty regarding when and how much the Developer will be paid, leading to potential disputes.",

By either Party on provision of seven (7) days written notice to the other Party in case of a Force Majeure Event. 2. Client has the unilateral right to cancel this agreement at any time within a 7-day notice period. Further, Developer can only cancel due to lack of payment. Client will have a 30 day right to cure before a cancelation can occur. 3. By either Party for a material breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other Party, if the other Party's material breach is not cured within three (3) days of receipt of written notice thereof. This shall include any delays to the timeline specified in Exhibit A. 4. By the Client at any time and without prior notice, if the Developer is convicted of any crime or offense, fails or refuses to comply with the written policies or reasonable directives of the Client, or is guilty of serious misconduct in connection with performance under this Agreement.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Developer retains the right to terminate this agreement at any time, for any reason, with no less than 60 days written notice to the client.",
                "explanation": "The original clause 4(a) outlines specific conditions under which the agreement can be terminated, with varying notice periods and causes. The added sentence grants the Developer the right to terminate at any time for any reason with a 60-day notice, directly conflicting with the initially restrictive conditions and creating ambiguity about which termination terms apply. It is now uncertain whether the Developer is bound by the 'lack of payment' clause.",

The Maintenance & Support is not included in this contract, but we suggest making a plan in the future that includes bug fixing, server monitoring and constant optimization of the apps. 90 days warranty (bugfixing) support is included.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the maintenance and support obligations after the 90-day warranty period. The clause initially states maintenance and support are not included after the initial warranty. The added sentence states \"Developer will fix any bugs that may come up from the original contract after the 90 days warranty has passed.\" This introduces ambiguity about who is responsible for maintenance and support after 90 days, and if the developer is still responsible for fixing bugs with no guarantee for extra pay.",

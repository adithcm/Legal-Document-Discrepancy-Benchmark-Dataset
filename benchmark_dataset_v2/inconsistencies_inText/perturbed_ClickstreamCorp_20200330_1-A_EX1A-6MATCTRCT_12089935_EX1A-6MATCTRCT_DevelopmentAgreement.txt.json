                "explanation": "The original text states the Developer can only cancel due to lack of payment with a 30-day cure period for the client. However, the added clause allows the Developer to terminate the agreement with a 30-day written notice for any reason. This contradicts the initial condition, creating uncertainty about the actual termination rights of the Developer.",

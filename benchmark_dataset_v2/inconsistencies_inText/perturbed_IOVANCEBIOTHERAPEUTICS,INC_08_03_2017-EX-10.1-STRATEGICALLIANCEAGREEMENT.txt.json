                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by extending the payment deadline from 30 to 60 days. This creates ambiguity and could lead to disputes over when late fees or other penalties apply.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction about the return of all confidential information. The clause now suggests that MD Anderson can choose to withhold some confidential information or materials, while still allowing LBIO to choose between return and destruction, but limits the range of materials to which that choice applies. It further conflicts with the earlier section defining Confidential Information and obligations of non-disclosure.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by changing 'the later of' to 'the earlier of'. This dramatically alters the duration of the agreement, creating a direct conflict and ambiguity regarding the contract's lifespan.",

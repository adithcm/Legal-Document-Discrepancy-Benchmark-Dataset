                "explanation": "The original text states revocation is only effective for the revoking party. The modified text contradicts this by stating that revocation is effective immediately for *all* parties upon notice to any one party. This creates uncertainty as to whether the agreement continues for non-revoking parties.",

However, each party retains the right to independently file amendments under Section 13, should they deem it necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a mandatory joint filing agreement. The addition of the sentence 'However, each party retains the right to independently file amendments under Section 13, should they deem it necessary' introduces a contradiction. It creates ambiguity as to whether joint filing is always required or if individual parties can bypass the agreement for Section 13 amendments, thus undermining the enforceability of the original joint filing obligation.",

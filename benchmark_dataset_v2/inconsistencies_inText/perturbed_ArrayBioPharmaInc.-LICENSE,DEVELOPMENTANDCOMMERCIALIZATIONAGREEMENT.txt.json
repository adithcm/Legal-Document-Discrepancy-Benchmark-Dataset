Ono shall notify Array in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days after the achievement of each milestone set out in Section 6.2(b) by Ono, or any of its Affiliates",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by setting conflicting deadlines for payment of milestone payments and notification of milestone achievements. The original text states milestone payments are due within 'thirty (30) days' and notification of milestones within 'fifteen (15) Business Days'. The altered text changes this to 'sixty (60) days' for milestone payment and 'thirty (30) Business Days' for notifications, creating an inconsistency regarding the payment due date.",

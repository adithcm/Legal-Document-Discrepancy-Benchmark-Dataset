                "original_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the terms \"Affiliate\" and \"Associate\" shall have the respective meanings set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act; the terms \"beneficial owner\" and \"beneficial ownership\" shall have the same meanings as set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act; the terms \"economic owner\" and \"economically own\" shall have the same meanings as \"beneficial owner\" and \"beneficially own,\" except that a person will also be deemed to economically own and to be the economic owner of (i) all shares of Common Stock which such person has the right to acquire pursuant to the exercise of any rights in connection with any securities or any agreement, regardless of when such rights may be exercised and whether they are conditional, and (ii) all shares of Common Stock in which such person has any economic interest, including, without limitation, pursuant to a cash settled call option or other derivative security, contract or instrument in any way related to the price of shares of Common Stock; the terms \"person\" or \"persons\" shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization or other entity of any kind or nature; and the term \"Related Person\" shall mean, as to any person, any Affiliates or Associates of such person.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the definition of \"Affiliate\" for the specific purpose of Section 3(a)(v). While the general definition refers to Rule 12b-2, Section 3(a)(v) now has a stricter definition of 50% common ownership. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it is unclear which definition applies when determining if a sale of securities triggers the restriction in Section 3(a)(v).",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by adding a condition that can shorten the Standstill Period. The original definition provides a specific endpoint (certification of vote), while the modified definition introduces an earlier termination based on an acquisition agreement. This introduces uncertainty about the actual duration of the Standstill Period, especially concerning the Investor's obligations. Which obligation should be followed?",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by stipulating that specific clauses in Section 2(a) only require a simple majority vote to be amended as opposed to all parties. This introduces a contradiction because certain amendments may now be applied without all signatures. Would that amendment be legally binding? There is uncertainty as to which procedure has priority.",

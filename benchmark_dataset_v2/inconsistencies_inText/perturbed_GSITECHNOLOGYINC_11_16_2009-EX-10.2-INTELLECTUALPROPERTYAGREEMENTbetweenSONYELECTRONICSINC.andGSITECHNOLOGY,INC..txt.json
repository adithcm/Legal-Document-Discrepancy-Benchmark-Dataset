                "original_text": "6. Payment\nConsideration for the license granted by SONY under this IP Agreement is included in the Purchase Price, and PURCHASER  shall have no obligation to make any additional payments to SONY for the license granted under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "6. Payment\nConsideration for the license granted by SONY under this IP Agreement is included in the Purchase Price. PURCHASER shall make royalty payments to SONY for each product sold that utilizes the licensed patents, as determined by the schedule outlined in Exhibit C. These payments are due quarterly, 30 days after the end of each quarter. PURCHASER shall also have no obligation to make any additional payments to SONY for the license granted under this Agreement, unless it relates to royalty payments for items sold.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment terms. The original text states that the purchase price includes consideration for the license with no additional payments. The modified text introduces royalty payments, creating ambiguity about the total cost of the license and enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "7.2 Termination\n(a) Should either Party fail to observe faithfully and materially perform each of the material obligations assumed by it in this IP Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall immediately have the right to terminate the license granted by it under this Agreement. No notice period is required for termination due to breach of contract. The breaching party has no right to remedy the situation, and termination will take place immediately after the written notice is sent.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction about the period to remedy a breach of contract. The original text provides a 30-day period after written notice to remedy a breach. The modified text allows immediate termination with no remedy period, making it unclear which termination procedure applies and creates enforcement uncertainty.",

Notwithstanding the  foregoing, a Party may transfer or assign its rights under this IP Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially  all of its assets, on condition that it provides the other Party with notice of the transfer or assignment.

Notwithstanding the  foregoing, a Party may not transfer or assign its rights under this IP Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, even if it provides the other Party with notice of the transfer or assignment. Any attempted transfer in contravention of this Section 9.3 shall be valid if both parties agree to enter into a new contract at that time.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates a contradiction regarding the assignability of the contract. Originally, it wasn't assignable without consent, except in cases of mergers, etc., with notice. The changed text first allows it to be assignable without consent and then forbids the assignment in cases of mergers, and then creates a caveat that if a new agreement is signed, the original is still valid. This creates confusion about under which circumstances the contract is assignable and its legal consequences.",

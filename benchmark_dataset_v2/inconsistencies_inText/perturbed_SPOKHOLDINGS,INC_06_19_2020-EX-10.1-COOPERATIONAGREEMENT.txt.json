                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. Originally, the White Hat Parties had to provide evidence *before* the meeting. Now, they provide it *after*. This makes it unclear when the Company should expect the evidence and if the votes influenced the outcome.",

One party (the Company) has the right to assign the agreement in certain situations without consent, while the other (White Hat Parties) always needs consent. This disparity contradicts the implied mutual obligation and can create legal uncertainty.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's total reimbursement obligation under this section shall not exceed $25,000.",
                "explanation": "This creates conflicting reimbursement limits. One part of the section states the limit is $55,000, while another part states it's $25,000. This contradiction introduces ambiguity about the actual reimbursement amount and creates a potential dispute.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by stating that rates can be changed with 30 days' notice, but then adding that rates can be increased immediately under certain conditions. This creates ambiguity about when rate changes can occur and the required notice period.",

However, Company may terminate this agreement at any time without notice if Contractor violates any local, state, or federal law.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the termination clause. Originally, either party could terminate with 15 days' notice. The modified clause allows the Company to terminate immediately without notice under specific circumstances, creating ambiguity about termination requirements.",

Company and Contractor hereby waive any claim to award of attorneys fees in such a suit. Notwithstanding the above, if Contractor is found to be in gross negligence, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to Company.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence creates an inconsistency. The original text explicitly waives any claim to attorneys' fees for either party. However, the added exception allows the court to award attorney fees to the Company if Contractor is grossly negligent, contradicting the initial waiver and creating uncertainty about fee recovery in litigation.",

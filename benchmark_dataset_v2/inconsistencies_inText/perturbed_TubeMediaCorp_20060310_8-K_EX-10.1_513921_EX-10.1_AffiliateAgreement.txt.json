If this Agreement terminates on any date other than at the end of a calendar quarter, Network shall supply such statement as of the date of termination, within forty-five (45) days thereafter, and this obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement until Affiliate receives such statement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating two different deadlines for when the Network must submit a report to the Affiliate after the end of each calendar quarter: sixty (60) days vs the original forty-five (45) days. Furthermore, there is a second contradiction regarding the timeline of the report if the agreement terminates, stating thirty (30) days vs the original forty-five (45) days, creating uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "16.4 Bank of America shall pay Supplier for all services and applicable taxes invoiced In arrears in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of receipt of a valid and correct invoice by Bank of America. Bank of America reserves the right to pay prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period. If Bank of America pays within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice by Bank of America, a discount of two percent (2%) will be subtracted from the total invoice amount for Services.",
                "changed_text": "16.4 Bank of America shall pay Supplier for all services and applicable taxes invoiced In arrears in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of receipt of a valid and correct invoice by Bank of America. Bank of America reserves the right to pay prior to the expiration of the ninety (90) day period. If Bank of America pays within forty-five (45) calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice by Bank of America, a discount of one percent (1%) will be subtracted from the total invoice amount for Services.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment terms. The original text states payments will be made within 60 days, with a discount if paid within 30 days. The modified text changes these to 90 days and 45 days respectively, with a different discount. This creates uncertainty regarding the correct payment deadline and discount rate, causing ambiguity in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the term of the agreement. The original text stated that the agreement is perpetual. The modified text defines a finite initial term with automatic renewals, creating confusion about the agreement's duration and renewal conditions.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the termination terms. The original text stated termination could be done at any time, without charge. The modified text adds a 1-year waiting period, termination fee, and increases the notice period, creating an inconsistency that affects the enforcement and validity of either termination clause.",

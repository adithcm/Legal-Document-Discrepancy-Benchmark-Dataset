All other amounts due under this Agreement will be invoiced by VNE to Converge on a monthly basis in arrears. All such invoiced amounts shall be due to VNE within 30 days following Converge's receipt of VNE's invoice. All payments will be made by Converge in U.S. dollars, without setoff, recoupment or deduction. All fees and other amounts not paid when due shall be subject to late charges of the lesser of (a) 1.5% per month of the overdue amount or (b) the maximum permitted under applicable law.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by creating different payment deadlines based on the invoice amount. The original text states that all invoiced amounts are due within 30 days, while the added sentence specifies a 60-day payment term for invoices exceeding $100,000. This creates uncertainty regarding which payment term applies to larger invoices.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that Converge must install Maintenance Updates within a 'reasonable time', considering testing and customization. This is subjective. The modification changes this to a concrete 30-day period, overriding any need for testing/customization, introducing conflict and uncertainty. This is an in-text contradiction because 'reasonable time' and '30 days irrespective of testing' are mutually exclusive in certain scenarios.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding service provision upon late payment. The original text states that VNE is *not* required to provide *additional* services if payment is late. The modified text states that VNE *will* continue to provide services up to the quarterly allocation amount, with services *beyond* ceasing if payment is late. This creates a direct contradiction about whether services should be provided at all in the event of late payments.",

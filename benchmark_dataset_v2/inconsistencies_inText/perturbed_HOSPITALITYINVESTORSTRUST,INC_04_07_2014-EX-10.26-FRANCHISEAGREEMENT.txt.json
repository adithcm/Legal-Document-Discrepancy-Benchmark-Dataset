                "original_text": "8.2.2 The Monthly Fees will be paid to us at the place and in the manner we designate on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each month and will be accompanied by our standard schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of the Monthly Fees for such month.",
                "changed_text": "8.2.2 The Monthly Fees will be paid to us at the place and in the manner we designate on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each month and will be accompanied by our standard schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of the Monthly Fees for such month.\n8.2.2.1. However, for the months of June, July and August, the monthly fees must be paid before the last day of the month to avoid late penalties. The computation schedule can be submitted the following month.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the payment deadline for monthly fees. The original clause states that fees are due by the 15th of each month. The added clause creates an exception for June, July, and August, stating that payment is due by the end of the month, creating ambiguity and uncertainty about when the payments are actually due.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to pay amounts under $500 within the cure period shall not be grounds for termination.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding the termination terms. Section 14.1.1 states that failure to pay any sums due results in termination, but 14.1.1.1 states failure to pay sums under $500 is not grounds for termination. This creates uncertainty as to which terms are enforcable.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction in the 'Liquidated Damages on Termination' clause. The original text establishes that liquidated damages will be paid on termination of the agreement. The altered text states that if the franchisor terminates, liquidated damages will not be payed.

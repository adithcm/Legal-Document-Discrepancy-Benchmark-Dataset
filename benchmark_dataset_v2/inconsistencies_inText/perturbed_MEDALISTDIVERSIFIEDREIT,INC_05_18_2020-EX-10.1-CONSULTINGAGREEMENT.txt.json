This Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) upon the death or bankruptcy of CONSULTANT; or (b) upon the close of business on the date the Company gives CONSULTANT written notice of Termination for Cause (as defined below); (c) ninety (90) days following the date the Company gives CONSULTANT written notice of termination for any or no reason; or (d) CONSULTANT may terminate this Agreement by giving ninety (90) days' written notice to REIT.",

This Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) upon the death or bankruptcy of CONSULTANT; or (b) upon the close of business on the date the Company gives CONSULTANT written notice of Termination for Cause (as defined below); (c) thirty (30) days following the date the Company gives CONSULTANT written notice of termination for any or no reason; or (d) CONSULTANT may terminate this Agreement by giving ninety (90) days' written notice to REIT.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the term automatically renews for twelve months, while the changed text reduces this renewal period to six months. This creates a direct contradiction, leading to uncertainty about the contract's duration after the initial term. This also refers to Section 8, where the above change was implemented, furthering confusion.",

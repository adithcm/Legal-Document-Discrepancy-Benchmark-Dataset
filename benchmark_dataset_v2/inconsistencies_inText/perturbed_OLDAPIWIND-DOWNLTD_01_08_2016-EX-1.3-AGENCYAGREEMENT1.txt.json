                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the payment deadline for the Agents' Fee. The original text implies immediate payment at the Closing Time. The modified text states payment is due within 30 days of the Closing Time. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction regarding when the certificate needs to be received. Initially, it had to be received at Closing Time, but now it must be received within 10 days of the Closing Date. This creates potential ambiguity if the closing is delayed, or if other clauses refer to actions contingent on receipt at Closing Time.",

The original text states Dundee gets 40% and Kes 7 gets 30%, while the modified text reverses those percentages. This creates a conflict of interest among the agents, and is inconsistent with previous and subsequent sections of the document.",

                "explanation": "The original text states a clear desire to add software, establishing an obligation. The modified text introduces uncertainty ('may desire') and questions the acknowledged receipt of consideration ('may or may not be acknowledged'), contradicting the firm commitment implied elsewhere in the agreement. This introduces uncertainty about the fulfillment of obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Schedule [A] is 'hereby incorporated', meaning immediately and definitively included. The modified text uses 'considered for incorporation' and 'potential use,' which creates doubt and uncertainty, contradicting the explicit incorporation mentioned initially, and therefore creating a potential point of conflict and non-enforcement.",

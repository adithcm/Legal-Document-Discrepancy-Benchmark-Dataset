Operator shall invoice Owner, monthly, for all costs and expenses incurred hereunder during the immediately preceding month and, without duplication, in any prior month. Owner shall pay all such amounts prior to the later of (a) 50 days after the end of the month in which the expenses were incurred or (b) 10 days after the date of receipt of each invoice. Invoices received after 1:00 pm local time will be deemed received on the next Business Day. If the day on which any payment is due is not a Business Day, then the relevant payment shall be due upon the immediately succeeding Business Day. Any amounts which remain due and owing after the due date shall bear interest at the lower of the prime rate as published in the \"Money Rates\" section of The Wall Street Journal plus two percent (2%) per annum and the maximum lawful rate of interest, compounded daily from the date such payment is due until such payment is made. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any indemnification payments required to be made by a Party hereunder shall be made to the indemnified Party upon receipt by the indemnifying Party of written demand therefor from the indemnified Party.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes the payment deadline for indemnification payments. The original text states they are to be paid 'upon receipt' of written demand, which is ambiguous. The modified text specifies a strict 5-business-day deadline, creating a contradiction with the 'upon receipt' clause. This creates uncertainty because, under the new clause, the indemnified party may expect payment within 5 days but will be hard to impose this if the party that should pay argue for the 'upon receipt' deadline.",

                "explanation": "The modification adds a clause that allows Owner to terminate the contract 'at any time without a prior notice period' if the Operator's performance falls below a certain industry standard. This contradicts the earlier part of Section 3.3, which requires a written notice of termination and a 60-day period for the termination to take effect. The conflict creates uncertainty because it's unclear under what circumstances the Owner can bypass the notice period and immediately terminate the agreement, leading to legal disputes.",

If it is subsequently determined, whether by mutual agreement of the Parties or otherwise, that Owner is required to pay all or any portion of the disputed and withheld amounts, then in addition to paying such amounts, Owner shall pay interest accrued on such amounts (including amounts withheld) at the default interest rate described in Section 5.2.1 from the original due date until paid in full. 5.3 Setoff.",

                "explanation": "The modification alters the deadline for notifying the Operator of a payment dispute. The original clause requires a notice 'on or before the date such payment is due'. The altered text introduces a strict 30-day notice period tied to the invoice date and threatens forfeiture of dispute rights if the deadline isn't met. This creates a conflict, as the owner might reasonably assume the notice can be given until the payment due date according to the general standard, leading to disputes about the validity of withheld payments and creating ambiguity about when the amounts are actually due. The 30 day clause acts as a strict condition, while the original text is tied to the payment terms.",

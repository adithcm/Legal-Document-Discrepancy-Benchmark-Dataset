Operator shall invoice Owner, monthly, for all costs and expenses incurred hereunder during the immediately  preceding month and, without duplication, in any prior month. Owner shall pay all such amounts prior to the later of (a) 50 days after the end of  the month in which the expenses were incurred or (b) 10 days after the date of receipt of each invoice. Invoices received after 1:00 pm local time  will be deemed received on the next Business Day. If the day on which any payment is due is not a Business Day, then the relevant payment  shall be due upon the immediately succeeding Business Day. Any amounts which remain due and owing after the due date shall bear interest at  the lower of the prime rate as published in the \"Money Rates\" section of The Wall Street Journal plus two percent (2%) per annum and the  maximum lawful rate of interest, compounded daily from the date such payment is due until such payment is made. Notwithstanding anything  herein to the contrary, any indemnification payments required to be made by a Party hereunder shall be made to the indemnified Party upon  receipt by the indemnifying Party of written demand therefor from the indemnified Party.",

Now, the payment is due 30 days after month-end or 45 days after the invoice, creating in-text contradiction that can cause uncertainty on enforcement.",

If a good faith dispute arises as to the amount payable under any invoice issued by Operator, Owner shall pay the amount  not in dispute on or before the due date, and if Owner elects to withhold any portion of a payment which otherwise would be due if not for such  dispute, Owner shall provide Operator a written notice of such dispute on or before the date such payment is due setting forth, in reasonable  detail, its reasons for withholding the disputed amount. If it is subsequently determined, whether by mutual agreement of the Parties or  otherwise, that Owner is required to pay all or any portion of the disputed and withheld amounts, then in addition to paying such amounts,  Owner shall pay interest accrued on such amounts (including amounts withheld) at the default interest rate described in Section 5.2.1 from the  original due date until paid in full.",

The original text indicates the notice is due 'on or before the date such payment is due', while the change specifies 'within 5 days of discovering the disputed amount'. This creates an ambiguity.",

Operator shall cooperate with Owner's auditors by  (i) making the applicable books and records available for inspection by Owner's auditors, and (ii) making such copies of books and records as may be reasonably requested by  such auditors. In no event shall Owner's audits unreasonably interfere with Operator's operations. Owner will be responsible for all costs of any  such audit; provided that if, in any audit, Owner discovers overpayments by Owner of at least $250,000 in the aggregate (\"Material  Overpayment\"), Operator will reimburse Owner for such Material Overpayment and all reasonable costs incurred by Owner in connection with  such audit (\"Audit Costs\"). Owner shall have up until two years after the close of a Calendar Year in which to make an audit of Operator's records  for such Calendar Year. Except for any bill or statement with respect to which an Adjustment Claim is made within the two-year audit period, the  bills and statements rendered for the Calendar Year prior to such two-year audit period shall be conclusively established as correct. An  \"Adjustment Claim\" shall mean a written claim by Owner to Operator requesting a refund or other financial adjustment in respect of any  overpayment by Owner (including in the case of a Material Overpayment, all Audit Costs) and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such  claim. Operator shall, within 10 days of receipt of an Adjustment Claim, provide Owner with the requested refund or other financial adjustment;  provided that if Operator shall dispute in good faith some or all of the amounts set forth in such Adjustment Claim, Operator may elect to withhold  any disputed amounts, pending resolution of the dispute. If the Parties shall fail to resolve their dispute with respect to the remaining Adjustment  Claim amount within 15 Business Days, Owner may, at its sole option, refer such dispute for resolution in accordance with the terms of Section 9.6.  Unless otherwise resolved by the Parties, any bill or statement that is the subject of an Adjustment Claim shall be conclusively established as  correct if dispute resolution procedures have not been initiated under Section 9.6 of this Agreement within 180 days of the submission of an  Adjustment Claim.

                "explanation": "The modifications to Section 6.5 introduce multiple contradictions regarding audit parameters. The threshold for 'Material Overpayment' is changed from $250,000 to $100,000, creating an ambiguity in defining what constitutes a significant overpayment. The timeframe for conducting an audit is reduced from two years to one year. The deadline for Operator to respond to an Adjustment Claim is extended from 10 days to 30 days. The timeframe to resolve dispute claims has reduced to 5 business days. These inconsistencies can cause confusion and create uncertainty.",

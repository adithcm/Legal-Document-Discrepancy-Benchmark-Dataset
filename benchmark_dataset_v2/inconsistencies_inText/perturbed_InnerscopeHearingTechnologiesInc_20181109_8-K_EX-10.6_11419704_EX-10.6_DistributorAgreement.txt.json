                "original_text": "b. Erchonia shall submit invoices to Distributor after or concurrent with shipment of Products to Distributor at the delivery address. Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 30 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "changed_text": "b. Erchonia shall submit invoices to Distributor after or concurrent with shipment of Products to Distributor at the delivery address. Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 30 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 45 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 1.5% of the invoice amount. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.",
                "explanation": "The payment term is changed from 30 days to 45 days which introduces inconsistency. Although a late fee is mentioned, this change introduces ambiguity because the late fee is triggered at a different timeframe, causing confusion over the payment expectations.",

                "changed_text": "Prices will remain in effect for the period of the initial 2 year term.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency by reducing the fixed pricing period, contradicting the previously agreed five-year term. This creates uncertainty for the distributor, as it is unclear how long the current prices will remain fixed.",

                "changed_text": "Note: Performance goals to begin 60 days after receipt of FDA market clearance.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts the original clause by shortening the grace period before performance goals take effect from 120 to 60 days after FDA market clearance. This creates an in-text contradiction regarding the time frame for performance goal initiation, which introduces uncertainty and potential disputes over compliance expectations.",

Delinquent payments are subject to a late payment charge of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month commencing sixty (60) days from the invoice date. Client agrees to reimburse Agent for any attorney's fees and any other costs associated with collecting delinquent payments.",

Delinquent payments are subject to a late payment charge of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month commencing forty-five (45) days from the invoice date. Client agrees to reimburse Agent for any attorney's fees and any other costs associated with collecting delinquent payments.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that late payment charges commence 60 days from the invoice date. This has been changed to 45 days from the invoice date. This creates an in-text contradiction, introducing uncertainty as to when late payment fees are actually applied, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies immediate payment of fees upon termination. The changed contract specifies payment within 30 days of the effective date of termination.

                "explanation": "In the original text, the client has 30 days after receiving notice to cure a payment default, while the modified text extends this period to 45 days. This contradiction undermines the clarity of the contract and could spark disagreements about termination rights.",

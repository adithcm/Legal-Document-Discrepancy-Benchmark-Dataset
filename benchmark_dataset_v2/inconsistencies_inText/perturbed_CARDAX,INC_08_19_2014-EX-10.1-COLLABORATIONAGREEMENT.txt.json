                "original_text": "1.4 \"Affiliate\" shall mean, with respect to either Party, all entities which, directly or indirectly, are controlled by, control or are under common control with such Party. For purposes of this Agreement, the word \"control\" shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, including through ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting shares or interest of an entity; provided, however, with respect to CAPSUGEL, the term \"Affiliate\" shall be limited to entities who directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries are controlled by the parent of CAPSUGEL's direct parent entity and with respect to CARDAX the term \"Affiliate\" shall not include Cardax Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
                "changed_text": "1.4 \"Affiliate\" shall mean, with respect to either Party, all entities which, directly or indirectly, are related to or associated with such Party. For purposes of this Agreement, the word \"control\" shall mean the ability to influence the actions of an entity, including through business relationships, common ownership or partnership; provided, however, with respect to CAPSUGEL, the term \"Affiliate\" shall be limited to entities who directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries are controlled by the parent of CAPSUGEL's direct parent entity and with respect to CARDAX the term \"Affiliate\" shall not include Cardax Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the definition of \"Affiliate\" to include entities that are merely 'related to or associated with' either party and defining control more broadly as 'ability to influence'. This conflicts with the original, more restrictive definition of 'control' as ownership of more than 50% of voting shares, creating ambiguity about which entities qualify as affiliates. This can cause uncertainty and disputes about the rights and obligations extended to affiliates under other sections of the contract.",

                "changed_text": "5.1 Royalty Payments. CAPSUGEL shall pay to CARDAX a royalty equal to [***] of the Adjusted Net Sales (\"Royalty Payment\") within [***] after the end of [***]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CAPSUGEL may delay payment of the Royalty Payment if CAPSUGEL determines, in its sole discretion, that CARDAX has failed to meet its obligations under Section 2.3.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the payment deadline for royalty payments. Initially, it mandates payment within a specified timeframe. However, the added sentence introduces an exception, allowing CAPSUGEL to delay payment if it believes CARDAX has not met its obligations under Section 2.3. This provides an ambiguous justification for delayed payments, creating uncertainty about when CARDAX will actually receive its royalties and potentially leading to disputes over whether CAPSUGEL's delay is justified.",

Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product.

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a conflict regarding the use of CAPSUGEL's intellectual property upon a breach by CAPSUGEL. Initially, it grants CARDAX the right to use CAPSUGEL's IP for development and marketing. However, the added sentence states that CAPSUGEL can revoke this right at any time. This creates a direct contradiction, making it unclear whether CARDAX truly has a guaranteed right to use CAPSUGEL's IP after a breach, potentially disrupting CARDAX's ability to continue development and marketing efforts.",

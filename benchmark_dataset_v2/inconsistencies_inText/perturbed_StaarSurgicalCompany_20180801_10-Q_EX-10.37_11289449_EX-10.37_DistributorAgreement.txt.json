Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "4.2 Payment for the Products shall be in U.S. Dollars, or such other currency as STAAR may require in its sole discretion, and made within forty-five (45) days of STAAR's invoice. Late payments shall be subject to an interest charge of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "The change in payment terms from 'thirty (30) days' to 'forty-five (45) days' introduces a contradiction with potential clauses added later that might specify shorter payment windows or penalties for payments delayed past 30 days. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual payment deadline.",

Each purchase order submitted to STAAR is subject to acceptance by STAAR at its offices to which such order was submitted. The purpose of the purchase order to be issued under this Agreement is for scheduling only; no terms and conditions of Distributor's purchase orders or any other document or instrument of Distributor shall be binding upon STAAR or amend or modify this Agreement in any manner, notwithstanding any language to the contrary contained in any such purchase order, instrument or document. Distributor should place its last order in each quarter by the tenth day of the last month in each quarter (e.g., March 10, June 10, September 10, and December 10).",

                "explanation": "Changing the order deadline from the 'tenth day' to the 'fifteenth day' of the last month in each quarter creates a direct contradiction, making it unclear when the final order must be placed. This could cause disputes over order fulfillment and timing.",

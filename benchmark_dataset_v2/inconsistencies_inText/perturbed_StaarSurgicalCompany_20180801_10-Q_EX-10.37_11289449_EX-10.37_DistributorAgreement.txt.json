Distributor, for itself and on behalf of each of its employees, hereby waives any rights which may be granted to it or them under the laws and regulations of the Territory or otherwise which are not granted to it or them by this Agreement.

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying clause (f) of section 14.4. The original clause states that the terminating party shall not incur any liability for any damage, loss or expense suffered by the other party due to termination. The modified clause states that the terminating party shall incur liability for any damage, loss or expense. This creates direct contradictory obligation. It now becomes uncertain on which clause applies.",

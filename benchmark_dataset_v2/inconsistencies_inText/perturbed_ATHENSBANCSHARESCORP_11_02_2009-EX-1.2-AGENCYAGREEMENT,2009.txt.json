                "original_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after  the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in  next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date.",

All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds within 10 business days of the End Date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating fees are payable within 10 business days of the End Date, contradicting the earlier statement that fees are payable at the earlier of the Closing Date or the End Date. This creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "The original text stated reimbursable expenses are to be paid at the Closing. The changed text now states the company remits payment within 30 days of receiving the account. This directly contradicts the prior statement, introducing uncertainty.",

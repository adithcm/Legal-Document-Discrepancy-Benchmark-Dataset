                "original_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date.",
                "changed_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or 60 days after the End Date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that unpaid fees are payable either at the Closing Date or 60 days after the End Date, conflicting with the earlier statement that obligations terminate 45 days after the Subscription Offering. This creates uncertainty about the payment deadline.",

In the event the Bank determines to abandon or terminate the Conversion prior to Closing, payment of such expenses shall be made in next day funds on the date such determination is made.",
                "changed_text": "Not later than two days prior to the Closing Date, the Agent will provide the Company with an accounting of all reimbursable expenses to be paid at the Closing in next day funds. In the event the Bank determines to abandon or terminate the Conversion prior to Closing, payment of such expenses shall be made in next day funds 30 days after the date such determination is made.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts the original statement by changing the payment deadline for reimbursable expenses after the termination. Originally, payments were due on the date of determination, but the modified version states that payments should be made 30 days after the date of determination. This creates uncertainty and a potential payment delay.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces an in-text contradiction by adding a one-year limit to the survival clause. Initially, the indemnities, warranties, and representations were to remain in full force and effect indefinitely. This creates ambiguity regarding the duration of the protections and obligations.",

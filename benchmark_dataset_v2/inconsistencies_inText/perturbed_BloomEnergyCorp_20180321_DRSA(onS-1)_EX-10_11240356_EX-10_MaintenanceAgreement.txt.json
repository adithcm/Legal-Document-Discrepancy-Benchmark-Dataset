With respect to each year of such Facility's Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice. Interest shall accrue daily on the Service Fees not paid when due, at the lesser of the monthly rate of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) or the highest rate permissible by law on such unpaid balance. Operator shall be under no obligation to provide or perform services hereunder for any Bloom System whose Service Fee has not been paid in full for the then-current warranty year.",

With respect to each year of such Facility's Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within forty-five (45) days of invoice.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by extending the payment deadline for service fees from 30 days to 45 days. This directly contradicts the original clause and creates ambiguity regarding the actual due date for payments, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "original_text": "Section 5.4 Payment. Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice no later than the last business day of the month Recipient received such invoice unless disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment.",

Recipient shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Fees shown on an invoice no later than the last business day of the month Recipient received such invoice unless disputed in accordance with Section 5.7. Any amount not received from the invoiced Party within such period shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate, from and including the last date of such period to, but excluding, the date of payment. \n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, for invoices exceeding $1,000,000, the Recipient shall have 60 days from receipt to make payment without incurring interest.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause states a specific payment deadline (last business day of the month), but the added clause introduces a different deadline (60 days) for invoices exceeding a certain amount. This creates uncertainty as to which payment term applies, leading to potential disputes. If a million-dollar invoice is sent on the last day of the month, it will cause a conflict. ",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction related to the termination notice period. Section 6.2 initially states a 30-day notice period for termination, however, the additional text allows for a much shorter 10-day notice period for specific IT infrastructure services. This directly conflicts with the 30 days. This inconsistency raises concerns about which termination timeline should be followed, potentially triggering disputes.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a conflict in liability limitations. The initial clauses of Section 9.4 strongly limit liability to fees paid or exclude consequential damages. However, the final added paragraph creates an exception for cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct leading to physical harm, lifting the fee-based liability cap. This contradiction generates ambiguity about the actual liability limits, potentially creating disagreements in instances of such events, leading to uncertainty and disputes about enforcement and remedies.",

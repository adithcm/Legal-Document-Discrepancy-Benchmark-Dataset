                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, provided that individual filers reserve the right to amend their portions of the filing independently. This Agreement is for administrative convenience only and does not create a binding obligation to jointly amend filings.",
                "explanation": "The original text indicates a complete agreement for joint filing and all amendments. The changed text introduces a contradiction by stating that individual filers can amend their portions independently and that the agreement is not binding. This creates uncertainty about the obligations of joint filing, as one clause suggests a unified approach, while the other allows for independent actions, potentially leading to inconsistencies and disputes regarding filing responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, but only the first signed counterpart will be considered the official and binding version of the Agreement. All other counterparts are for informational purposes only.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that all counterparts are deemed to be an original and constitute the same agreement. The changed text contradicts this by stating that only the first signed counterpart is considered official and binding, while others are for informational purposes only. This creates ambiguity regarding which version of the agreement is legally enforceable if different counterparts contain varying terms or signatures.",

                "changed_text": "IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned may execute this Agreement, with the effective date to be determined individually by each signatory upon their respective execution.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines July 6, 2020, as the agreement's execution date. The modified version introduces a contradiction by allowing each signatory to determine their own effective date upon execution. This creates a temporal conflict, making it unclear when the agreement becomes effective and undermining the original intention of a unified commencement date.",

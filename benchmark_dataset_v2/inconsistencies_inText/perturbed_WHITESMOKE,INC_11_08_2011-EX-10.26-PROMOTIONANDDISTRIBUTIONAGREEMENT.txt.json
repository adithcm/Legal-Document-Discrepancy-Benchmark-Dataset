                "explanation": "Changing the payment timeframe for overpaid amounts from '[ * ]' to '90 days' introduces a contradiction. The general payment term is '[ * ] following the [ * ]', but for overpayments, Google can demand repayment within 90 days. This creates uncertainty because it is unclear if '[ * ]' is shorter than 90 days. If '[ * ]' is shorter, then there is a conflict of what is the legitimate terms.",

                "explanation": "Adding the sentence 'However, no interest can be charged until 120 days past due' creates a direct contradiction regarding when interest can be charged. The original clause allows interest from the due date, but the added sentence delays this for 120 days, creating uncertainty about the effective date for interest accrual.",

                "explanation": "The original text states payment is due 'upon signing,' while the modified text introduces a 10-day grace period. This contradiction creates uncertainty about the exact payment deadline.",

This agreement will automatically renew for an additional year unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to April 30, 2018.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines a one-month term. The added sentence introduces an automatic renewal clause with a 30-day notice requirement *before* the initial termination date, creating a conflict. If no notice is given before April 1st, does the contract automatically renew, even though the original term was clearly defined?",

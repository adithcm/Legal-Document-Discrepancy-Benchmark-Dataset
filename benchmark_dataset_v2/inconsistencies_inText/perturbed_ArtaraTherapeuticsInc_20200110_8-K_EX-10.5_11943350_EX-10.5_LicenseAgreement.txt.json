                "original_text": "3.2 Approval Milestone based on Data Value: Within forty-five (45) days of an approval of the TARA-002 BLA by the FDA, ArTara will pay a one- time approval milestone to University pursuant to the usefulness of the Program Data in TARA-002's BLA filing, as set forth below:",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in payment deadlines. Section 3.2 originally stated that the approval milestone payment would be made within 45 days of FDA approval. The modified text shortens this to 30 days. This directly contradicts the original payment timeframe, creating uncertainty and potential for dispute regarding when the payment is actually due.",

ArTara will, no later than ninety (90) days following the close of each calendar quarter, pay tiered Royalties based on annual Net Sales of Product in the Indication as set forth below:",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a potential delay in royalty payments. Originally, royalty payments were to be made no later than a confidential timeframe ([...***...]) following the close of each calendar quarter. By changing this to a fixed 90-day period, the new term introduces ambiguity if the original confidential timeframe was shorter than 90 days. This creates an inconsistency, as the new term extends the payment deadline and could cause disputes regarding when the royalties are actually due. The enforcement of the original clause becomes difficult.",

However, this shall not apply to damages arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an exception to the waiver of consequential damages. The original clause explicitly states that neither party is liable for consequential damages. The modified version adds a caveat stating that this limitation does not apply to damages resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct. This directly contradicts the original blanket waiver, creating uncertainty about the extent to which consequential damages can be claimed. It becomes unclear whether such damages are indeed waived in all circumstances or if an exception exists, potentially leading to disputes and rendering the enforcement of the original clause ambiguous.",

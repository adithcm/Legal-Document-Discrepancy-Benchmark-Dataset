                "original_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",
                "changed_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, except that provisions regarding intellectual property rights, confidentiality, and any accrued payment obligations arising before the termination date shall remain in full force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, all other provisions of the Original Agreement are terminated.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that certain provisions (intellectual property, confidentiality, and accrued payments) of the Original Agreement *do* survive termination, conflicting with the initial statement that *no* provisions survive. This creates uncertainty about which parts of the original agreement are still enforceable.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Termination Agreement represents the agreement between the parties regarding the termination of the Original Agreement. However, either party may unilaterally modify specific aspects of this Termination Agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Such modifications will only be applicable to the party initiating the change, unless agreed upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause by stating that while the Termination Agreement represents the agreement, either party can unilaterally modify it with written notice. The original clause specifies that modifications require a written agreement signed by both parties. The new clause introduces an exception that contradicts the original intent and raises enforceability questions.",

However, it may not be assigned or transferred to any successor or assign without the express written consent of both parties, which may be withheld at their sole discretion. Any attempt to assign or transfer this Agreement without such consent shall be void and without effect, except in cases of mergers.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that while the Termination Agreement benefits the parties, it cannot be assigned to successors or assigns without explicit consent, which may be withheld. The original clause states it's binding on successors and assigns without qualification. This creates uncertainty about whether successors and assigns are bound and/or benefit from the agreement.",

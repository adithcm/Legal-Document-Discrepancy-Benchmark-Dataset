                "explanation": "By adding \"MMMW DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES EXCEPT FOR THOSE REQUIRED BY LAW.\" we are adding a clause that may be interpreted as a conflicting clause with the disclaimer of all implied warranties. While the contract explicitly disclaims all implied warranties, the phrase 'except for those required by law' introduces ambiguity. It suggests that some implied warranties may still apply if mandated by law, creating uncertainty regarding the extent of MMMW's warranty obligations. This discrepancy could lead to disputes about whether a specific warranty is legally required and therefore applicable despite the general disclaimer.",

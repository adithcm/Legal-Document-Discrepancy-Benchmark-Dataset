                "changed_text": "9.1 Timing of Payments\n\nPayments shall be made during the time periods set forth in this Agreement. If not stated explicitly, payments shall be made by Roche within [… ***…] after Roche receives an invoice from FMI.\nNotwithstanding the previous sentence, all payments must be remitted within 15 business days of invoice receipt, regardless of any other clauses in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that payments should be made within the time periods set forth in the agreement, but then overrides this by mandating a 15-day payment window. This creates ambiguity about which payment deadline applies.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation creates a conflict because the original clause states that all rates and costs remain firm for the agreement term, while the added sentence allows FMI to increase rates annually.

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the assignment clause. The original sentence restricts assignment to third parties without consent, while the added sentence permits Roche to assign the agreement freely in the event of an acquisition. This causes uncertainty regarding the conditions under which the contract can be assigned.",

All payments not paid by the date such payments are due shall bear interest from the due date to the date payments are actually paid at the lower of (a) 1% per month or (b) the maximum rate permitted by law.\n\nHowever, no interest will be applied if the payment is made within 10 business days after the due date. Any interest accrued will be waived.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding interest on late payments. Section 6.7 initially states that all late payments will accrue interest. However, the addition states that no interest will be charged if payment is made within 10 business days after the due date, and any accrued interest will be waived, contradicting the original intent and creating ambiguity regarding payment terms.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a condition where VerticalNet can terminate immediately without a cure period if LeadersOnline files for bankruptcy, contradicting the original clause which stipulates a 30-60 day cure period for all material breaches.

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by altering the payment deadline for the second fee installment. Initially, it was due within 90 days of the effective date. Now, it's due within 60 days, while the subsequent installments remain unchanged. This creates ambiguity regarding the correct payment schedule and could lead to disputes.",

All payments not paid by the date such payments are due shall bear interest from the due date to the date payments are actually paid at the lower of (a) 1% per month or (b) the maximum rate permitted by law. However, no interest shall be charged if payment is made within 5 business days of the due date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency by adding a grace period for interest accrual. The original clause states that interest accrues from the due date. The added sentence now says no interest will be charged if the payment is within 5 business days of the due date. This creates uncertainty about when interest charges will apply.",

Notwithstanding the forgoing, claims related to intellectual property infringement may be brought up to four years after the cause of action accrues or becomes known.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by creating a different limitation period for intellectual property claims. The original clause imposes a two-year limitation on all claims. By stating intellectual property claims can be brought up to four years, it conflicts with the general limitation. This creates ambiguity regarding which limitation applies to intellectual property claims.",

                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction. Section 5 originally states that payment from Kubient to Customer shall be made within seven (7) days from Kubient's receipt of payment, but it has been changed to thirty (30) days. This creates ambiguity about the actual payment deadline, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the termination clause. The original text requires ninety (90) days written notice to terminate the agreement following the initial term, but this has been changed to thirty (30) days.

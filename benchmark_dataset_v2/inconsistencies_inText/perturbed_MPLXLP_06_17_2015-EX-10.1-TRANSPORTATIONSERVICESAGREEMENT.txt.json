If the amount owed by Shipper is the subject of a good faith dispute, Shipper shall be obligated to pay only the undisputed portion of such amount pending the resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Agreement.

The original text states payment is due within fifteen (15) days, while the modified text extends it to thirty (30) days. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding the enforceable payment timeline, which could lead to disputes over late payment penalties and interest accrual.",

The Parties agree that the Construction Cost Reimbursement shall be deemed liquidated damages and that such amount shall not be deemed a penalty, but rather represents a reasonable amount of liquidated damages in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by Shipper's termination of this Agreement as stated, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non- feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and that the payment of such amount shall be MPL's sole and exclusive remedy for such termination by Shipper.",

                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction in Section 17.1. The original text states that MPL's determination of non-creditworthiness must be no less than industry standards. However, the edited text removes this standard, giving MPL greater discretion in determining non-creditworthiness. The further edited text also states that MPL may request an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount no greater than 12 months based on the Quarterly Volume Commitment. This contradicts the original text, which limits the amount no greater than 6 months based on the Quarterly Volume Commitment. This makes it unclear about financial requirement, leading to uncertainty.",

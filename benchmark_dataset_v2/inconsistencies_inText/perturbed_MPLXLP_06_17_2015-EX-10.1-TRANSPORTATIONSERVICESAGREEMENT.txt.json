                "explanation": "Section 3.4 initially states that payments are due within 15 days. By changing this to 30 days, there is now a conflict in payment deadlines. This discrepancy creates uncertainty regarding the timeframe for payments, potentially leading to disputes over late fees and interest accrual.",

Definitions \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries' controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the Person in question. \"Applicable Law\" means any applicable statute, law, regulation, ordinance, rule, determination, judgment, rule of law, order, decree, permit, approval, concession, grant, franchise, license, requirement, or any similar form of decision of, or any provision or condition of any permit, license or other operating authorization issued by any Governmental Authority having or asserting jurisdiction over the matter or matters in question, whether now or hereafter in effect.",

Definitions \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries' controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the Person in question. However, for the purposes of section 8 (Assignment), an affiliate shall mean any entity with a business relationship with either party. \"Applicable Law\" means any applicable statute, law, regulation, ordinance, rule, determination, judgment, rule of law, order, decree, permit, approval, concession, grant, franchise, license, requirement, or any similar form of decision of, or any provision or condition of any permit, license or other operating authorization issued by any Governmental Authority having or asserting jurisdiction over the matter or matters in question, whether now or hereafter in effect.",
                "explanation": "In the definition section, 'Affiliate' is initially defined by control. The edited definition adds a clause that specifically for section 8 (Assignment), the definition of affiliate expands to any entity with a business relationship. This creates an in-text contradiction. The definition section defines 'affiliate' based on control and now the edited text states for section 8, an 'affiliate' is now an entity with a business relationship. Section 8 will have to be re-written, or a court will need to decide the application of the definition.",

If MPL is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Shipper decides to terminate this Agreement after the Effective Date but prior to the commencement of transportation service on the Pipeline, Shipper shall notify MPL of its decision to terminate within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date to allow MPL the opportunity to provide Shipper's unwanted capacity to other interested shippers as Unsubscribed Capacity as set forth in Section 3.8.",

                "explanation": "In Section 10.5, the original text states the Shipper must notify MPL within 180 days of the project's in-service date regarding termination. The changed text shortens this notification period to 30 days. This is a contradiction. The 150 day difference can cause disputes over the required notification period. If the Shipper acts after 30 days, it may be viewed as a breach.",

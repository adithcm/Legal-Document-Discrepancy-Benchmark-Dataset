The occurrence of any of the following will be deemed an Event of Default by Programmer under this Agreement: (a) Programmer fails to observe or perform its obligations contained in this Agreement in any material respect; or (b) Programmer breaches the representations and warranties made by it under this Agreement in any material respect.\n\n11.2 Licensee Events of Default. The occurrence of the following will be deemed an Event of Default by Licensee under this Agreement: (a) Licensee fails to observe or perform its obligations contained in this Agreement in any material respect; or (b) Licensee breaches the representations and warranties made by it under this Agreement in any material respect.\n\n11.3 Cure Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Event of Default will not be deemed to have occurred until fifteen (15) days after the non-defaulting party has provided the defaulting party with written notice specifying the Event of Default and such Event of Default remains uncured.\n\n11.4 Termination in the Event of Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and in the absence of a timely cure pursuant to Section 11.3, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement, effective immediately upon written notice to the defaulting party.",

However, if the Event of Default is by the Programmer, the Licensee must provide a 30-day notice for termination.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting terms regarding the termination process. While the original clause grants the non-defaulting party the right to terminate immediately upon written notice after the cure period, the modification adds a stipulation that if the Programmer is the defaulting party, the Licensee must provide a 30-day notice. This creates an inconsistency as the general rule allows immediate termination, but for the programmer's default, the licensee has to wait 30 days. This contradiction can cause confusion and disputes over the correct termination procedure, because there is no reason why the licensee has to wait 30 days.",

However, if the WLIB programs increase Licensee advertising revenue by 20% relative to the average of the previous year, Programmer will pay Licensee 10% of the incremental revenue. Such payments shall be made quarterly within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction to the payment terms. Initially, Section 5 states that no payment is due from the Programmer to the Licensee. The modified version introduces a contingent payment obligation if the WLIB programs increase advertising revenue. This creates an ambiguity because it is unclear whether the 'no payment' clause is absolute or if the contingent payment overrides it. This can cause disputes and uncertainty about payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency to the indemnification clause. Initially, the Programmer is required to indemnify and hold the Licensee harmless against *any and all* liability arising from the listed events. The modified clause introduces a deductible of $10,000 for any indemnifiable loss, to be paid by the Licensee. The contradiction lies in whether the Programmer's indemnification is truly 'any and all' or whether it's reduced by the initial $10,000. This creates ambiguity and can lead to disputes about who is responsible for the initial portion of damages.",

                "changed_text": "Section 4.2. Termination for Convenience. Licensor reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice for any reason, including if the usage of the Brand is not in compliance with the standards and policies. However, Licensee may only terminate this agreement for Licensor's uncured material breach of this agreement, with a 30-day notice and cure period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding termination rights. Licensor can terminate at will, but the Licensee's ability to terminate is severely restricted, creating an imbalance and uncertainty regarding termination conditions.",

                "changed_text": "Section 4.1. Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for a period of 10 years, unless terminated earlier pursuant to Sections 4.2 through 4.4. Upon the expiry of this 10-year term, this agreement shall automatically renew for subsequent 5-year periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 6 months prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts the original clause stating the agreement continues 'in perpetuity.' Now, the term is defined as 10 years with automatic renewals, which creates confusion about the length of the agreement and whether perpetual rights are actually granted.",

The parties' rights and remedies herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights and remedies provided by applicable Law.",
                "changed_text": "Section 9.6. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right hereunder, in whole or in part, shall operate as a waiver thereof, EXCEPT that any failure by Licensor to enforce Section 3.2 (Prior Written Approval) for a period exceeding 60 days shall be deemed a waiver of Licensor's right to enforce that provision for that specific instance. The parties' rights and remedies herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights and remedies provided by applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a specific exception to the 'No Waiver' clause. While generally, no delay constitutes a waiver, a 60-day non-enforcement of the Prior Written Approval clause now acts as a waiver for that instance. This contradicts the overall intent of the 'No Waiver' provision and adds ambiguity to enforcement procedures.",

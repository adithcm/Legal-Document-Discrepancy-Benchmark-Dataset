Unless such  election is made in writing, all cash payments shall be made by check, drawn to the order of Auriemma or its designated entity or entities and  delivered to the address first stated above. Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire's receipt of the  applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month.",

Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason (i) all payments that have accrued  prior to the termination or expiration of this Agreement will be payable in full within thirty (30) days thereof, but any obligations to make further  payments due, or that may have come due, under this Agreement shall become null and void; (ii) except as otherwise provided herein, the Services  Period and the Contract Period shall end immediately and Berkshire shall promptly cease all use of the Auriemma Identification including any  displays, documents, artwork, symbols, logos trademarks, trade names, photographic or graphic representations, depictions and/or other materials  (including, but not limited to, advertising and/or promotional materials), which in any way or form (hard copy, electronic or otherwise) use the  Auriemma Identification (collectively, \"Materials\"), except as otherwise set forth herein; and (iii) except as otherwise provided herein, Berkshire  shall promptly remove all links and references to Auriemma and Materials from its website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agreement is  terminated for any reason other than Berkshire's material breach, then for thirty (30) days following such termination, Berkshire may continue to  use any printed material already produced under this Agreement. At the conclusion of this period, Berkshire's use of the printed material will  cease.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that payments are due within 30 days of termination. It also allows the use of printed material for 30 days after termination.

Changing this to 'under common operational influence' broadens the definition, creating a contradiction in terms. This introduces legal uncertainty about which entities are considered affiliates and creates dispute on whether affiliates can act on Berkshire's behalf.",

IAC may not submit an invoice for a Product prior to that Product's transfer of title to Sonos.

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding payment deadlines. The original clause states that payment terms are based on the date of acceptance of the invoice, but the modified clause introduces a new condition stating invoices exceeding a certain amount are due 30 days from the invoice date, regardless of acceptance. This creates ambiguity because it is not clearly defined when the payment should be made, which could lead to disputes over contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "Here, the original text states that payment happens after the invoice is accepted by Sonos.

                "explanation": "The contradiction lies in the timing of pricing formula inputs. The original clause specifies that product price is based on the pricing inputs on the date of manufacture. The modified clause introduces an exception, stating that the cost of Components (over 10% of BOM) will be determined at the time of Purchase Order placement. This creates uncertainty about what data the pricing should be calculated from, creating ambiguity in enforcement.",

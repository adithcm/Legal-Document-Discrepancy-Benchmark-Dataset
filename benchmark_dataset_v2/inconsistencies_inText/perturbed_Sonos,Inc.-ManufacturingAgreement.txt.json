IAC may not submit an invoice for a Product prior to that Product's transfer of title to Sonos.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in when IAC can submit an invoice. The original clause states invoices can be submitted *after* the transfer of title. The modified clause allows for invoicing *prior* to the title transfer (no sooner than 15 days after shipment) creating an in-text contradiction and uncertainty about the appropriate invoicing schedule and payment obligations.",

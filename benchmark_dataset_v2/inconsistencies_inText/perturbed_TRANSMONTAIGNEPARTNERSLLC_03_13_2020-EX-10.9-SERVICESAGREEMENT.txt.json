                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Such reimbursements shall be made by the Operating Company to EmployeeCo in advance or immediately upon such costs being incurred, or otherwise in accordance with historical practice, unless otherwise agreed between the Operating Company and EmployeeCo.",
                "changed_text": "Such reimbursements shall be made by the Operating Company to EmployeeCo immediately upon such costs being incurred. Under no circumstances shall reimbursements be delayed beyond 60 days, regardless of historical practice or any other agreement between the Operating Company and EmployeeCo.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original clause allows for reimbursements based on historical practice or other agreements, potentially allowing for delays. The modified clause mandates immediate reimbursement and imposes a 60-day absolute deadline, overriding any prior agreements or practices. This creates uncertainty about the enforceable payment schedule.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may be terminated by (a) the written agreement of the Parties or (b) by either Party upon 5 days written notice to the other Party. All payment obligations hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated by (a) the written agreement of the Parties or (b) by either Party upon 5 days written notice to the other Party. All payment obligations hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement; however, any outstanding payments upon termination shall be immediately due and payable, regardless of their original terms.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original terms regarding payment obligations after termination. The original clause states that payment obligations survive in accordance with their 'respective terms,' implying the original payment schedule remains. The modified clause overrides this by stating that all outstanding payments are immediately due upon termination, regardless of the original schedule. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes about payment deadlines following contract termination.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be amended or modified from time to time by the written agreement of at least two of the Parties hereto. However, any changes to Article I require the written agreement of all Parties. Each such instrument shall be reduced to writing and shall be designated on its face an \"Amendment\" or an \"Addendum\" to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an inconsistency regarding the amendment process. The original clause requires the written agreement of all parties for any amendment. The modified clause allows amendments with only two parties agreeing, except for Article I, which still requires all parties. This introduces confusion and potential conflict regarding which amendment process applies to specific clauses, creating uncertainty about the validity of amendments and leading to disputes.",

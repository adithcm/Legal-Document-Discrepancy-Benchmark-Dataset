Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.",

Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all invoices related to Services performed under Section 3a (Non-Production Related Work), payment shall be due upon Cerus's acceptance of the deliverables, regardless of the [*] day period. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by specifying that for invoices under Section 3a, payment is due upon acceptance of deliverables, overriding the standard [*] day payment term. This creates uncertainty as to which payment term applies in Section 3a.",

If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus. Within [*] days of any notice of rejection, Porex shall present a corrective plan of action to Cerus. Upon approval by Cerus of the corrective plan, Porex, at no additional expense to Cerus, shall then make the corrections and, where applicable, Porex shall resubmit the corrected Services to Cerus.

Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. However, for Non-Production Related Work, Cerus's acceptance period is limited to 7 days. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus.

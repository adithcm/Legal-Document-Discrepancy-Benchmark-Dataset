                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment dates for quarterly fees. The added text introduces a contradictory clause granting Sponsor an additional 15-day grace period, conflicting with the original 'on or prior to' deadline. This introduces uncertainty regarding the actual payment due date, as late payment penalties are not specified.",

Either party may terminate the Term upon not less than sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other party of any breach hereof by such other party. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Snap Technologies, Inc. may terminate the Term with thirty (30) days written notice if they determine that the co-branding agreement is no longer beneficial for their business objectives. In addition, either party may terminate the Term immediately upon written notice in the event that the other party shall fail to do business in the normal course or become subject to any bankruptcy, assignment for creditors, corporate dissolution or similar proceeding.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires 60 days' notice for termination due to a breach. The added sentence allows Snap to terminate with only 30 days' notice if they deem the agreement no longer beneficial. This creates a contradiction because Snap's termination rights are now more lenient than Sponsor's, leading to uncertainty about the applicable notice period.",

                "explanation": "The original assignment clause allows assignment to corporate affiliates without consent for either party. The modified text removes that exception for United Airlines, Inc., meaning they must seek consent for assignment to affiliates while Snap Technologies Inc. does not.

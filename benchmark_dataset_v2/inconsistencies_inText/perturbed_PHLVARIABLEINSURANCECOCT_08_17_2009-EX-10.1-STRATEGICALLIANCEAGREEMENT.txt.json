                "changed_text": "  1.04 Affiliate. With respect to a person, any other person collaborating, strategically aligned, or working alongside such person. This definition is specifically applicable for Sections 9.02.2 and 9.02.3 regarding trademark licensing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' implies a strict control relationship. The changed definition broadens the scope to include entities that merely collaborate or are strategically aligned, particularly for trademark licensing. This creates a contradiction because other sections may rely on the original, narrower definition, leading to disputes over which entities qualify for certain rights and obligations. It particularly contradicts the general use of affiliate in the rest of the document, while making it specific only for trademark licensing.",

Any of the PHL Parties, on the one hand, and ICC, on the other, upon 15 days written notice, may suspend issuance of (1) new Certificates entirely or (2) new Certificates guaranteeing ICC Accounts that invest in one or more Models with certain style attributes or investment vehicles, as may be expressly provided in such written notice, provided, however that the PHL Parties may suspend the issuance of new Certificates affected by a change in any of the Models after the 10  consecutive Business Day following the date on which either PHLVIC or PLIC deliver notice under the Memorandum of Understanding concerning its reasonable determination that it cannot hedge proposed changes without incurring material additional risk and/or material additional hedging costs, or because Phoenix is unable to obtain a reasonably appropriate hedge, if ICAS has made the proposed changes and not cured such changes within such five-day period.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 30 days written notice for suspension of new certificates and allows the PHL Parties to suspend the issuance of new Certificates affected by a change in any of the Models after the 5 consecutive Business Day. The changed text requires 15 days written notice and requires 10 consecutive Business Day. This creates a direct conflict in the notice periods required, making it unclear when a suspension can legally take effect.",

The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under paragraph 1 will take place within the following two time periods per year, as applicable: (a) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's first 2 fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's second fiscal quarter; and (b) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's third fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's fourth fiscal quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in compliance with applicable law, any capital contribution provided for under paragraph 1 may be made by AIG after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year of the Company but prior to the filing by the Company of its statutory financial statements for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year, respectively, and contributions of this nature shall be recognized as capital contributions receivable as of the balance sheet date of the yet to be filed quarterly or annual financial statement (as the case may be), pursuant to paragraph 8 of Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 72, to the extent approved by the Domiciliary State.",

Capital contributions must be made no later than 5 business days from the end of the reporting period.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding the deadline for capital contributions. The original text specifies two time windows based on financial statement filings, but then allows contributions after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year but prior to the filing. The modified text mandates a strict deadline of 5 business days from the end of the reporting period, contradicting the earlier stipulations and creating uncertainty about the enforceable deadline.",

AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"); provided, however, that AIG agrees not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies the 3 corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells the Company to an acquirer, in each case, (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the modification of corporate structure or sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such modification of corporate structure or sale. To the extent not terminated previously by AIG pursuant to the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate automatically one year after the closing of any sale of the Company by AIG, and all provisions hereof will be of no further force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph 7 shall not relieve either party of any obligation it may owe to the other party hereunder that existed prior to, and remains outstanding as of, the Termination Date.",

AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"). Notwithstanding the above, the Company may terminate this agreement at any time by providing written notice of 10 business days.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants AIG the absolute right to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice, subject to certain conditions related to corporate structure, ownership changes, and ratings. The added sentence gives the Company the right to terminate the agreement at any time with only 10 business days' notice. This creates a direct contradiction regarding termination rights, making it unclear under what conditions and with what notice period each party can terminate the agreement.",

This clause supersedes any termination clause mentioned in Paragraph 7.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that policyholder rights terminate upon termination of the agreement except for obligations existing before the termination date. The modified text adds a clause stating that policyholder rights under paragraphs 1, 3, and 4 are extended indefinitely regardless of termination and that this supersedes the termination clause in Paragraph 7. This directly contradicts the initial condition, creating ambiguity about whether policyholder rights continue after the agreement's termination.",

(\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Notwithstanding the obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand, and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.",

Notwithstanding the obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum Percentage on an annual basis, AIG has the sole discretion to revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if it deems it appropriate, without the consent of the Company. The Company can only suggest such changes and propose such changes that should be in writing.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by stating that AIG has sole discretion to revise the Specified Minimum Percentage, contradicting the initial agreement that it should be agreed upon by both AIG and the Company. This undermines the Company's input on a critical parameter, potentially leading to disputes.",

Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the modification of corporate structure or sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such modification of corporate structure or sale.",

Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. AIG can still terminate the agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the condition under which AIG can terminate the agreement. Initially, termination was restricted to situations where the acquirer had a certain rating or the capitalization was consistent with certain standards. By removing this rating requirement, the 'absolute right' to terminate becomes truly absolute, conflicting with the original limitations. AIG can now terminate without concern for rating or capitalization standards which introduces legal uncertainty and potential disputes over termination rights.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by removing the limitation on policyholder rights after the termination date. The original text states that policyholder rights terminate upon the Termination Date, except for obligations arising before that date. The changed text states that policyholder rights continue even after termination, regardless of AIG's outstanding obligations. This contradiction introduces uncertainty about the enforceability of the agreement after termination, and when policyholders do/don't have any rights against AIG.",

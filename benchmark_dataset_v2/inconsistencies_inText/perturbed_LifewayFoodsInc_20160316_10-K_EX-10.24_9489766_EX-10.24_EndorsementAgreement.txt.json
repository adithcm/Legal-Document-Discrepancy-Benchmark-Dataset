Compensation (a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway agrees to pay Individual a royalty (the \"Royalty\") equal to $0.02 for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics; provided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty will not exceed $50,000 in any month. All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",

The changed text adds a clause that allows Lifeway to defer payment for up to ninety (90) days in cases of unforeseen financial hardship. This directly contradicts the initial thirty-day deadline, creating uncertainty about the actual payment timeframe and the conditions under which the deadline can be extended.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants Lifeway a perpetual license to use the Individual's name and likeness. The added sentence limits Lifeway's rights to five (5) years from the Effective Date, creating a contradiction between the perpetual nature of the license initially granted and the imposed five-year limitation. This contradiction creates ambiguity about the duration of the license and raises questions about its enforceability beyond the initial five-year period.",

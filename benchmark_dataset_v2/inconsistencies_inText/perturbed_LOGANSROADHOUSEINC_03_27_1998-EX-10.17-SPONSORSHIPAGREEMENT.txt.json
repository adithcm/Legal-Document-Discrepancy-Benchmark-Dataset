In consideration of the services provided, SRP shall  be entitled to a base fee of Eighty Thousand Dollars and No/100's (580,000.00) payable as follows:\n\n         (i) $40,000.00 payable upon execution of this contract; and\n\n         (ii) the balance of $40,000.00 payable in eight equal monthly   installments of $5,000 each, due the first day of March, April, May, June, July, August, September and October, 1998.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction to the payment terms. While the original clause specifies a payment schedule, the added clause gives Logan's the right to delay payments, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over the agreed-upon payment timeline.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a clause that allows SRP to terminate the agreement for any reason, which conflicts with the original termination clauses that require specific conditions or a material breach.

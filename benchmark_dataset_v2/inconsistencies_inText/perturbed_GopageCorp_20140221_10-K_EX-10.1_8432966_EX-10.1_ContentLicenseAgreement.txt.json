In consideration of the licenses granted and other undertakings by Licensor hereunder, Licensee shall pay Licensor a License Fee in the amount of two hundred thousand dollars (US$200,000) (\"License Fee\"). The License Fee shall be due and payable as follows:   (a) US$50,000 upon signing the Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") between the Parties (provided, however, that Licensor hereby acknowledges receipt of this portion of the License Fee);   (b) US$50,000 upon signing of this Agreement; and   (c) US$100,000 upon on or before March 28, 2014.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the cancellability and refundability of the License Fees. Section 5.1 originally states that the License Fees are \"non-cancellable and non-refundable,\" while the added text states that they are \"cancellable and fully-refundable, if cancellation occurs within 30 days of the effective date.\" This creates uncertainty about whether the Licensee is entitled to a refund if they cancel the agreement within the specified timeframe, creating a direct in-text contradiction.",

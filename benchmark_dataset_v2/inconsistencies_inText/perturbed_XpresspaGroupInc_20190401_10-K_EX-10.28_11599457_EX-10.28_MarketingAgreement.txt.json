                "original_text": "8.01. XSPA shall pay to Calm on a monthly basis an amount equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the Retail Price for all Products sold in the Stores in the Territory during the applicable month minus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any commission actually paid or payable to XSPA employee(s) or contractor(s) attributable to sales of such Products during such month; provided that in no event shall such commission be greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the Retail Price for the applicable Product.",

However, for the months of June, July, and August, XSPA shall pay Calm within 90 days of the last day of the month in question.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence introduces a contradiction regarding payment deadlines. The initial statement implies a standard monthly payment schedule. The added sentence extends the payment deadline to 90 days for the months of June, July and August, creating ambiguity. It is unclear whether the standard monthly payment applies or the extended 90-day term for specific months.",

Calm's representatives may, from time to time during regular business hours on reasonable advance notice, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, inspect and audit such books and records and examine and copy all other documents and material in the possession or under the control of XSPA with respect to the subject matter and the terms of this Agreement. After completion of any inspection or audit pursuant to this Section 8.07, Calm shall notify XSPA of the results of such inspection and audit (the \"XSPA Audit Results\"). Upon receipt of such information, XSPA shall have thirty (30) days (the \"XSPA Review Period\") to review the XSPA Audit Results.",

                "explanation": "The change reduces the 'XSPA Review Period' from thirty (30) days to fifteen (15) days, creating a conflict with other references to the review period that might still refer to the original 30 days elsewhere in the contract. This discrepancy creates ambiguity and potential disputes over the time allotted for XSPA to review and respond to Calm's audit findings.",

In addition, if Calm does not provide XSPA with instructions within twenty (20) days of the termination or expiration of this Agreement, XSPA shall be permitted to dispose of any inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store. The Parties agree to promptly settle all accounting associated with such inventory of any and all Product Collateral then on hand at each Store upon termination or expiration of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict regarding the disposal of product collateral upon termination. The original clause allows XSPA to dispose of inventory if Calm doesn't provide instructions within 20 days. The change requires XSPA to retain inventory for six months. This creates an in-text contradiction about whether XSPA can dispose of the inventory after 20 days or if they must retain it for six months, leading to uncertainty and disputes.",

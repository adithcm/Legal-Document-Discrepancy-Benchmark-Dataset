                "original_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\"), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (\"Heritage\") Premier Nutrition Corporation (\"Premier\") is effective as of July 3, 2019 (\"Third Amendment Effective Date\") and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (\"Agreement\").",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\"), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (\"Heritage\") Premier Nutrition Corporation (\"Premier\") is effective as of July 3, 2019 (\"Third Amendment Effective Date\") and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (\"Agreement\"). All payment obligations arising from this amendment must be settled within 30 days of the Third Amendment Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a 30-day payment deadline for obligations related to the Third Amendment in the introductory paragraph. This deadline isn't mentioned in the original agreement and it directly contradicts the later clause which implies the original agreement's payment terms still apply, creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding payment terms for Schedule C-1. The original text states that all other terms remain in effect, implying the original payment schedule still applies. However, the added exception now mandates a 15-day payment window for items under Schedule C-1, conflicting with the overarching statement that all other terms remain unchanged. It is uncertain what the true payment terms for Schedule C-1 should be.",

The following is attached to an incorporated into the Agreement as Schedule C-1:\n\nSchedule C-1([***])\nNotwithstanding the above, all amounts owed under the original Schedule C-1 remain immediately due and payable upon execution of this amendment.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradictory payment term related to the original Schedule C-1. While the clause indicates that Schedule C-1 is being replaced, the added text states that all amounts owed under the original schedule are immediately due upon execution of the amendment. This contradicts the implicit understanding that the new schedule will govern future transactions, creating ambiguity and potential disputes related to outstanding payment obligations under the old schedule.",

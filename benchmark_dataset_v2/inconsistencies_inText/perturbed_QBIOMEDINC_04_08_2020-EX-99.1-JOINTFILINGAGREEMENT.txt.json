                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding responsibility for the accuracy of information. The original text clearly states each party is only responsible for their own information. The modified text states that responsibility for all information, including that of others, is shared, creating ambiguity and potential legal disputes regarding liability.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that all counterparts constitute one agreement. The modified text states that each counterpart is a separate agreement, directly contradicting the original intent and creating uncertainty regarding which terms apply to whom, especially if different counterparts contain slightly different terms or modifications.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. may, at the discretion of each signatory, be filed individually or jointly. Amendments may be signed by only those parties directly affected by the changes, and such partial filings shall be considered sufficient for compliance with Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a joint filing. The modified text introduces the option for individual filings and allows amendments to be signed by only affected parties. This contradicts the original agreement to file jointly, creating ambiguity about the required filing procedure and potentially undermining the purpose of a joint filing agreement.",

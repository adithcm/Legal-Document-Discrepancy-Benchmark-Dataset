                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",

The undersigned hereby agree that each shall be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, and also responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others. ",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that each party is responsible for the accuracy of both their own information and the information concerning others. The original agreement clearly states that each party is only responsible for their own information. This uncertainty can lead to disputes about liability for inaccuracies in the filing.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the validity of multiple counterparts. The original states all counterparts form one agreement, whereas the modified text suggests only the first fully executed version is valid. This could create confusion and potential disputes if different counterparts contain slightly different terms or signatures.",

                "explanation": "The original text states any amendment must be signed by *each* of the undersigned. The modified text states that any amendment need only be signed by *at least one* of the undersigned.

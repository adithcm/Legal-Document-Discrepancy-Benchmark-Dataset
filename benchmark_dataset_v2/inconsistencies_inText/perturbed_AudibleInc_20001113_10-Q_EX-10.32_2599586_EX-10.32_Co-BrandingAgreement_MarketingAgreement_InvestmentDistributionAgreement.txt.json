Payment of such interest shall not cure or excuse any breach of any underlying payment obligation.",
                "changed_text": "Payments called for by this Section 5 which are not received within five (5) business days after the date upon which payment is due will bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1- 1/2%) per month or the maximum legal rate permitted under the controlling Laws. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, payments received within fifteen (15) business days of the due date will not incur any interest. Payment of such interest shall not cure or excuse any breach of any underlying payment obligation.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding when interest on late payments is applied. The original text states interest accrues after five business days. The modified text adds that no interest will be charged if payment is received within fifteen business days, creating ambiguity and uncertainty about the enforcement of late payment interest.",

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, ACSI can assign the agreement to any entity at their sole discretion without written consent from the assignee to be bound by the agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding on and enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction regarding the assignment of the agreement by ACSI. The original text states that any assignee must agree in writing to be bound by all terms and conditions. The modification adds a clause allowing ACSI to assign the agreement at its sole discretion, even if the assignee doesn't agree to be bound. This introduces uncertainty as to whether an assignee is obligated to uphold the contract terms and who is responsible if terms are breached.",

However, either party is free to share confidential information on social media platforms, if they deem it important. Without limiting the foregoing, the Receiving Party will: (a) use such Confidential Information solely for the purposes for which it has been disclosed; and (b) disclose such Confidential Information only to those of its and its Affiliates' employees, agents, and consultants who have a need to know the same for the purpose of performing this Agreement and who are informed of and agree to a duty of nondisclosure.",
                "explanation": "The modification of this text introduces a contradiction. It first states that each party will protect confidential information and then adds a statement that allows the parties to share confidential information on social media if they deem it is important. This contradiction creates uncertainty on how confidential information must be handled.",

                "original_text": "One-half of the Annual Fee will be due on or before January 1 and July 1 of each Contract Year.",
                "changed_text": "One-half of the Annual Fee will be due on or before January 1 and July 1 of each Contract Year. The July 1 payment, however, may be extended to August 15th without penalty provided that Licensor provides written notification of such extension at least 15 days prior to the original due date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an inconsistency by creating an exception to the original payment deadline. While the first sentence states the payment is due on July 1, the second sentence allows for a delayed payment until August 15th under certain conditions. This creates uncertainty as to when the payment is actually due and if late fees apply between July 2 and August 15 if notification is given, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "original_text": "All additional remuneration will be due within thirty (30) days of each such accomplishment. Company agrees that all additional remuneration earned by Licensor during each Contract Year will be added to the Annual Fee for each remaining Contract Year during the Contract Period.",
                "changed_text": "All additional remuneration will be due within thirty (30) days of each such accomplishment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Major Win accomplishments, remuneration will be due within ninety (90) days of such accomplishment. Company agrees that all additional remuneration earned by Licensor during each Contract Year will be added to the Annual Fee for each remaining Contract Year during the Contract Period.",
                "explanation": "The modified text contradicts the general payment term of 'thirty (30) days' for additional remuneration by introducing a different payment term of 'ninety (90) days' specifically for Major Win accomplishments. This creates ambiguity as to which deadline applies for Major Win accomplishments. While the initial statement specifies a 30-day term, a later sentence indicates 90 days, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes.",

A certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage shall be furnished to Duval within thirty (30) days of the full execution of this Agreement.

Such insurance policy shall provide that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such policy or remove Duval as an additional named insured without prior written notice to Duval at least thirty (10) days in advance thereof.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces inconsistencies regarding the deadlines for providing the insurance certificate and the advance notice period for policy changes. Initially, the agreement states the certificate must be furnished within thirty (30) days, but it's later modified to sixty (60) days. Similarly, the advance notice period changes from twenty (20) days to thirty (10) days. These conflicting deadlines create ambiguity and uncertainty about compliance requirements.",

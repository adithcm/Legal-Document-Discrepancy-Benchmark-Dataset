(a) In consideration of the rights herein granted hereunder, Company shall pay to Licensor the annual fee set forth in the schedule below (the \"Annual Fee\"). Year Annual Fee ---- ---------- 2000 $850,000 2001 $850,000 plus amounts paid under Section 5 in 2000 2002 $850,000 plus amounts paid under Section 5 in 2000 and 2001 2003 $850,000 plus amounts paid under Section 5 in 2000-2002 One-half of the Annual Fee will be due on or before January 1 and July 1 of each Contract Year.",

However, for the year 2003 only, the full Annual Fee is due on December 31, 2003.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment schedule for the Annual Fee. The original text states that one-half of the Annual Fee is due on January 1 and July 1 of each Contract Year. The added sentence specifies that for the year 2003, the full Annual Fee is due on December 31, 2003. This contradicts the previous statement and creates uncertainty as to when the payment is due for 2003, whether it is half payments on the first of January and July or the full amount on December 31.",

However, no interest shall be charged if the delay in payment is due to Company's internal accounting errors. All amounts herein are in United States Dollars.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates an in-text contradiction by adding a condition where no interest is charged on late payments if the delay is due to 'Company's internal accounting errors.' This directly contradicts the earlier part of the section, which states that past-due payments 'shall bear interest'. This creates ambiguity regarding the applicability of interest charges and potential disputes over the definition of 'internal accounting errors'.",

Notwithstanding the above, if the defaulting party is Mossimo Inc., regarding payment defaults under $5,000, they shall have a 60-day grace period from the initial written notice before termination proceedings can commence. In order to be a sufficient notice hereunder, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default and shall specify the provision of this Agreement which applies to each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party is required to take in order to cure each item of default.",
                "explanation": "The addition creates a contradiction in the default clause. The original text states a 10-day cure period for payment defaults after written notice. The added sentence provides Mossimo Inc. a 60-day grace period for payment defaults under $5,000. This contradicts the initial 10-day period, introducing ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the actual cure period for smaller payment defaults by Mossimo, as the 60-day grace period undermines the previous defined breach.",

                "original_text": "The Fee shall be payable to Charity Tunes in two equal installments of $58,802.80  (plus applicable taxes) due to Charity Tunes on October 1, 2009 and November 1, 2009, respectively payable upon receipt of  invoice.",
                "changed_text": "The Fee shall be payable to Charity Tunes in two equal installments of $58,802.80  (plus applicable taxes). The first installment is due to Charity Tunes on October 1, 2009 payable upon receipt of invoice. The second installment is due November 15, 2009, but no invoice shall be required for that payment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment terms for the second installment. The original clause requires payment upon receipt of invoice for both installments, while the modified clause states no invoice is required for the second payment, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

Pin Codes entered for redemption after 11:59:59  pm PT on March 31, 2010 may be rejected as ineligible. However, for designated promotional partners, Pin Codes will be valid until April 15, 2010. The contents of this section are to be reflected in the Sponsor's rules  for the Promotion.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction by extending the validity of pin codes for 'designated promotional partners' until April 15, 2010, while the previous sentence states all pin codes entered after March 31, 2010 may be rejected. This creates ambiguity about which pin codes are actually eligible after March 31st and adds uncertainty about the specific rules for redemption.",

However, Charity Tunes is not responsible for delays due to technical issues or unforeseen circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The changed text contradicts the initial statement that Charity Tunes will provide immediate downloads. By adding that they are not responsible for delays due to technical issues or unforeseen circumstances, it creates uncertainty about Charity Tunes' actual obligation to provide immediate downloads. The term 'unforeseen circumstances' is vague, further increasing ambiguity.",

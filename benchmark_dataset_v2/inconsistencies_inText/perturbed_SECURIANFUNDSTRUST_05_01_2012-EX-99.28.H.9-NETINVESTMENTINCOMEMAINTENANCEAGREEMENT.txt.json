If the Investment Adviser is required to reimburse the Fund, the Investment Adviser shall make such payment within 30 days  after each month-end in the amount due the Fund as of each month. If the Fund is required to pay the Investment Adviser the Expense  Waiver, the Fund shall make such payment within 30 days after each month-end. Reimbursements to the Fund or the Expense Waiver  shall not include any additional charges or fees whatsoever, including, e.g., interest accruable on such reimbursements or the Expense  Waiver.",

If the Investment Adviser is required to reimburse the Fund, the Investment Adviser shall make such payment within 15 days after each month-end in the amount due the Fund as of each month. If the Fund is required to pay the Investment Adviser the Expense Waiver, the Fund shall make such payment within 45 days after each month-end.

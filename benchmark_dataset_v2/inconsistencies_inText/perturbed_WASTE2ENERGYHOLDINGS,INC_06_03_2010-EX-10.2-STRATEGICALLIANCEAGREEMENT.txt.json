The modified definition allows W2E to unilaterally decide on affiliates, creating a conflict regarding which entities qualify as affiliates and undermining the principle of mutual agreement throughout the contract.",

The modified text introduces a termination fee under the same condition, directly contradicting the 'without liability' clause and creating uncertainty about the financial consequences of failing to conclude the agreement.",

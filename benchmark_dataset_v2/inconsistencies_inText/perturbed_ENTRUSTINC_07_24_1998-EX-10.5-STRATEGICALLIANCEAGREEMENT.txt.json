                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction regarding the termination conditions of the Reseller Agreement. The original clause states the agreement expires 'whichever event occurs later,' implying a longer duration. The changed clause states 'whichever event occurs sooner,' shortening the agreement's lifespan. This introduces uncertainty as to when the Reseller Agreement actually terminates, causing potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "The modification of Section 6.11(c) creates a contradiction regarding the duration of the Patent Licenses. The original clause stated that the license terminates as provided in 6.11(a) or ten years from the effective date, 'whichever is later,' implying a longer period. The modified clause states 'whichever is earlier,' shortening the possible duration of the cross-licenses. This creates ambiguity about the expiration date, leading to possible disagreements.",

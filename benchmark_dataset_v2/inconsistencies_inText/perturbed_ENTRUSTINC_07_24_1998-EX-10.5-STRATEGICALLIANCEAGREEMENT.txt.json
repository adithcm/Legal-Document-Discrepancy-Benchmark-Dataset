At NTL's option and upon NTL's request, Entrust --------------- shall promptly enter into a non-exclusive reseller agreement with NTL, on behalf of Nortel, in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C (the \"Reseller -------- Agreement\") save as amended to comply with the provisions of this Article IV. - --------- NTL represents as of the Effective Date that the terms of the Reseller Agreement are materially similar to the terms of an agreement recently concluded with a third-party reseller of the Entrust Products, except for the provisions of Section 4.02 hereof. Subject to early termination for material default, such Reseller Agreement shall expire either in three years or when ETI ceases to be a Subsidiary of NTL, whichever event occurs later.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the term of the Reseller Agreement. The original text states that it expires either in three years or when ETI ceases to be a Subsidiary of NTL, whichever occurs later. The modified text changes the duration to five years and specifies that the agreement expires when either condition occurs sooner. This creates ambiguity regarding the actual term of the agreement, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

The original text specifies termination on the *later* of two dates, while the modified text changes this to the *earlier* of two dates and changes the anniversary from third to fifth. This fundamentally changes the expected lifespan of the agreement, leading to significant uncertainty and the potential for disputes regarding its validity and enforceability beyond the specified date.",

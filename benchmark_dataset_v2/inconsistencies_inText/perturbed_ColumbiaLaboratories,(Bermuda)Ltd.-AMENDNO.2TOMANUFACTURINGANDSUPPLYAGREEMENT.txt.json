Columbia shall pay each invoice in full within [***] after the date of receipt by Columbia of such invoice, which shall be issued no earlier than the date on which the Product is delivered to the carrier by Fleet. All payments shall be made in pounds sterling. In the event that any actual volume of Product purchased by Juniper in any calendar year means that a different purchase price should have applied to such volume of Product purchased in that calendar year (as calculated in accordance with the pricing model set out in Exhibit A), Fleet shall notify Juniper in writing of such pricing differential and shall apply a proportionate credit or debit (as applicable) to any invoices raised for the subsequent calendar year. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Fleet shall determine the applicable purchase price for that calendar year and shall notify Juniper in writing of any underpayment or overpayment within [***] of expiration or termination (as applicable). In the event of any underpayment by Juniper, Juniper shall pay to Fleet an amount equal to the amount of any such underpayment within [***] of receipt by Juniper of such written notice. In the event of any overpayment by Juniper, Fleet shall pay to Juniper an amount equal to the amount of any overpayment within [***] of receipt by Juniper of such written notice.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original clause states that invoices must be paid in full within a specific timeframe ([***] days). The added sentence provides a 2% discount for payments made within 15 days. This creates ambiguity: is the full amount due after [***] days, or is the discounted amount the 'full' payment if made earlier? This could lead to disputes regarding the correct amount to be paid and when it is due.",

The modified text grants Columbia the sole discretion to extend the term.

Neither party shall, without the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the other party having been obtained, assign or transfer this Agreement to any person or entity, in whole or in part (and any attempt to do so shall be void), provided that, each party may assign or transfer this Agreement without such consent to any Affiliate or to any successor by merger of such party, or upon a sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party's assets or business to which the subject matter of this Agreement pertains, provided that the acquirer of the business confirms to the Supplier in writing its agreement to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that the assignor shall remain liable for the obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be deemed unreasonable for Columbia to withhold consent, to any proposed or attempted assignment (including by merger or sale) by Fleet to a party which is not an Affiliate, if Columbia is not reasonably satisfied that the assignee possesses the management, finances, personnel, capabilities and facilities to perform fully the obligations of Fleet hereunder. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\"",

Neither party shall assign or transfer this Agreement to any person or entity, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party.

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a conflict regarding assignment rights. The original clause states that consent for assignment cannot be unreasonably withheld, providing a limitation on the non-assigning party's discretion. The modified clause removes this limitation, granting the non-assigning party sole discretion to refuse consent. However, it also introduces another statement regarding Columbia assigning to its subsidiaries. This contradiction creates uncertainty as to whether the 'sole discretion' applies in all cases, including assignments to affiliates, and also whether Columbia’s responsibility means Fleet’s permission is not required.",

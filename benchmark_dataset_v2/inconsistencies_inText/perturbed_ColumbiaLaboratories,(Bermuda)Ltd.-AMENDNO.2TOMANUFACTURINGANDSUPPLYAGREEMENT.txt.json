Columbia shall pay each invoice in full within [***] after the date of receipt by Columbia of such invoice, which shall be issued no earlier than the date on which the Product is delivered to the carrier by Fleet. All payments shall be made in pounds sterling. In the event that any actual volume of Product purchased by Juniper in any calendar year means that a different purchase price should have applied to such volume of Product purchased in that calendar year (as calculated in accordance with the pricing model set out in Exhibit A), Fleet shall notify Juniper in writing of such pricing differential and shall apply a proportionate credit or debit (as applicable) to any invoices raised for the subsequent calendar year. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, Fleet shall determine the applicable purchase price for that calendar year and shall notify Juniper in writing of any underpayment or overpayment within [***] of expiration or termination (as applicable). In the event of any underpayment by Juniper, Juniper shall pay to Fleet an amount equal to the amount of any such underpayment within [***] of receipt by Juniper of such written notice. In the event of any overpayment by Juniper, Fleet shall pay to Juniper an amount equal to the amount of any overpayment within [***] of receipt by Juniper of such written notice.

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by creating different payment deadlines based on the invoice amount. The original clause specifies a single payment term, while the modified clause introduces a second, conflicting payment term for invoices exceeding a certain amount. This creates ambiguity regarding which payment term applies, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

However, Columbia can only terminate the contract due to Fleet failing to maintain its authorization under Applicable law if they provide Fleet with a cure period of 30 days.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence introduces an in-text contradiction. While the original clause allows termination for failure to maintain authorizations after a certain notice period, the added sentence stipulates a 30-day cure period specifically for authorization failures. This creates confusion about whether Columbia can immediately terminate for such failures or must provide a cure period first.",

The original clause states that assignment requires consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) except for affiliates, mergers, or sale of business. However, the added sentence allows Fleet to assign the agreement to any entity with over $1 billion in revenue, regardless of Columbia's consent. This contradicts the general consent requirement and the specific conditions under which consent can be withheld, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes over assignment rights.",

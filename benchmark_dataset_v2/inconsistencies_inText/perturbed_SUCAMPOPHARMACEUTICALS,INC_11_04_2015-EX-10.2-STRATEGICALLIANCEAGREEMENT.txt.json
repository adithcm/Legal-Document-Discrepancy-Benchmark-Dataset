                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by specifying a different Settlement Date calculation if the Offer Period exceeds 45 Japan Business Days. This contradicts the initial definition and creates uncertainty regarding which settlement date is applicable.",

                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a contradiction regarding employment levels. Initially, there is an intention to 'maintain' employment levels. The change adds that the levels can be ‘adjusted at their sole discretion', which introduces uncertainty and a potential conflict. It is unclear whether SPI should make the adjustments or the Company.",

This Agreement shall be automatically terminated if the Offer has been withdrawn or the Offer is not successful due to the failure of obtaining the minimum threshold.

                "explanation": "The added sentence states that even if the offer is successful, Acquiror can terminate the agreement if closing doesn't happen in 180 days. This contradicts the final sentence indicating that the agreement cannot be terminated after a successful offer. It introduces uncertainty about the termination conditions post-successful offer.",

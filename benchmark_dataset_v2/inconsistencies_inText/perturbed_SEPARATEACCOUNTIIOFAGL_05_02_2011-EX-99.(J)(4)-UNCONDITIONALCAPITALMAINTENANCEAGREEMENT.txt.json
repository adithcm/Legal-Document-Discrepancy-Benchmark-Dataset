                "original_text": "AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that AIG agrees not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies the corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells the Company to an acquirer (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such sale.",

Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that upon sale, the acquirer must maintain capitalization consistent with *at least* the Company's then-current rating. The modified text removes the \"equal to or better than\" requirement, suggesting that any capitalization standard suffices, contradicting the previous condition and creating ambiguity as to the required capitalization level after the sale.",

                "changed_text": "Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no policyholder of the Company may take any action authorized under this paragraph 9 unless and until (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 9, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and, PROVIDED, FURTHER, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with paragraph 8 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for under this paragraph 9 shall terminate effective as of the Termination Date, with no exceptions whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows policyholders to retain rights to enforce AIG's obligations if they arose before termination. The modified version removes this exception, stating that all policyholder rights terminate upon the Termination Date, regardless of pre-existing obligations. This creates a direct contradiction as to whether policyholders retain rights to enforce pre-termination obligations, making the enforceability unclear.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows for dividends to be issued 'as soon as practicable' or 'such earlier time as may be agreed'. The change specifies that the payment should happen 'no later than 30 days'. This removes flexibility and creates a contradiction as it no longer allows for mutually agreed-upon earlier dividend payments.",

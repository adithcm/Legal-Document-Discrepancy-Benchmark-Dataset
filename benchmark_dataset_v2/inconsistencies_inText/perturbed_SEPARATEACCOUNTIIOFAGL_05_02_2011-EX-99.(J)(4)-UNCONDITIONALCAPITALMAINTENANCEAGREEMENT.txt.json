                "original_text": "4. The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under paragraph 1 will take place within the following two time periods per year, as applicable: (a) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's first fiscal 3 quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's second fiscal quarter; and (b) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's third fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's fourth fiscal quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in compliance with applicable law, any capital contribution provided for under paragraph 1 may be made by AIG after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year of the Company but prior to the filing by the Company of its statutory financial statements for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year, respectively, and contributions of this nature shall be recognized as capital contributions receivable as of the balance sheet date of the yet to be filed quarterly or annual financial statement (as the case may be), pursuant to paragraph 8 of Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 72, to the extent approved by the Domiciliary State.",

The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under paragraph 1 will take place within the following two time periods per year, as applicable: (a) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's first fiscal 3 quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's second fiscal quarter; and (b) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's third fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's fourth fiscal quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in compliance with applicable law, any capital contribution provided for under paragraph 1 must be made by AIG within 10 business days after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year of the Company.",
                "explanation": "Paragraph 4 originally specified two distinct contribution periods tied to the filing of statutory financial statements. The modification mandates that contributions 'must be made by AIG within 10 business days after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year of the Company,' creating a contradiction. The first part of paragraph 4 indicates that contributions can be made from the filing date until the end of the quarter, while the modified section requires that contributions must be made within ten days. This contradiction introduces uncertainty as to which timeline applies.",

                "original_text": "5. At the time that any contribution is due under paragraph 4, AIG agrees that it will either (a) make such contribution to the Company's direct parent and cause such direct parent to then contribute such funds, securities or instruments so contributed by AIG to the Company, or (b) make such contribution directly to the Company without receiving any capital stock or other ownership interest in exchange therefor, subject in either case to any required regulatory approvals.",
                "changed_text": "5. At the time that any contribution is due under paragraph 4, AIG agrees that it will make such contribution directly to the Company without receiving any capital stock or other ownership interest in exchange therefor, subject to any required regulatory approvals. AIG may, at its sole discretion, choose to contribute to the Company's direct parent instead.",
                "explanation": "The original text in paragraph 5 specifies that AIG agrees to contribute to the Company either directly or through the Company's parent. The changed text specifies that AIG agrees to contribute to the Company directly but it 'may, at its sole discretion, choose to contribute to the Company's direct parent instead.' This introduces a contradiction as it's unclear whether a direct contribution is obligatory or if AIG can arbitrarily choose to contribute through the parent. The original agreement indicates agreement that it will be either direct or through the parent, while the altered text imposes on AIG to make a direct contribution but can contribute to the parent instead. This difference in wording creates a potential point of dispute.",

AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that AIG agrees not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies the corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells the Company to an acquirer (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such sale.",

AIG may terminate this agreement for any reason.",
                "explanation": "The original Paragraph 8 states that AIG has the absolute right to terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice but also includes conditions under which AIG agrees *not* to terminate the agreement (related to significant modifications or sale of the company). The modified Paragraph 8 removes the conditions under which AIG agrees not to terminate the agreement and now states 'AIG may terminate this agreement for any reason'. This creates a direct contradiction. The original version outlines specific limitations on AIG's termination rights, while the modified version grants AIG unlimited termination rights. This is an inconsistency between the conditions provided and the termination clause.",

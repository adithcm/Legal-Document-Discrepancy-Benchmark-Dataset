                "original_text": "(a) Within [***] days after the conclusion of each Calendar Quarter to occur during the Term, commencing with the First Commercial Sale of the Product in the Field in the Territory, MMT shall deliver to SIGA a written report containing the following information (each a \"Quarterly Report\"): [***]. All such reports shall be considered Confidential Information of MMT. Concurrent with the delivery of the applicable Quarterly Report, MMT shall pay to SIGA in Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by SIGA in writing in advance of such payment the net result of Quarterly Collected Revenues, minus the corresponding Promotion Fee, and minus any applicable Credit Amount for such Calendar Quarter (all amounts as calculated in the Quarterly Report, and the payment of the net result being a \"Quarterly Payment\").",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, MMT shall have 60 days from the date of the Quarterly Report to remit payment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by stating that payments are due concurrently with the delivery of the Quarterly Report, but then adding that MMT has 60 days to remit payment. This creates confusion about the actual payment deadline, potentially leading to disputes.",

Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",

Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday). However, if the total amount due is less than $100, payment is due on the last day of the month.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment deadline. The original text specifies a Wednesday deadline for weekly access fees. The added clause introduces a different deadline (last day of the month) if the amount due is less than $100, creating ambiguity on which deadline applies. This could lead to disputes about late payments and breach of contract.",

However, Galacticomm's 24/7 support obligation is limited to business hours (9am-5pm EST) on weekends.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding Galacticomm's support obligation. The original text specifies 24/7 support. The added clause limits support to business hours on weekends, creating uncertainty about the level of support provided on weekends.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction about Horst Entertainment's right to purchase the software license upon termination. The original text states they have the right to purchase in the event of termination by Galacticomm. The added clause removes this right if the termination is due to Horst's breach, creating uncertainty about the circumstances under which they can exercise this right. This leads to ambiguity regarding which terms should be enforced, potentially leading to disputes.",

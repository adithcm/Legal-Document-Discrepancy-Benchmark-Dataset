                "original_text": "STW shall calculate the amount owed to COFS every one hundred-eighty (180) days (\"Accrual Period\"), and shall provide required payments to COFS within thirty (30) days after the end of the previous Accrual Period.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct conflict with the original payment deadline of 30 days in Section 14(b). The modified text now states that payments are due within 45 days, introducing uncertainty about which deadline is enforceable.",

                "explanation": "The modified text states that COFS is responsible for all the costs which directly contradicts the previous statement stating that STW is responsible for all the costs. This creates a direct conflict and ambiguity about who is responsible for those costs.",

                "explanation": "This change alters the maximum duration of a Force Majeure suspension from 24 months to 12 months. This creates a direct conflict within the contract as the parties are left unsure of the actual allowable suspension period.",

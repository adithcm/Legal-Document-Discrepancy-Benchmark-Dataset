                "original_text": "This Intellectual Property Agreement is subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement and is intended only to document the assignment of the Assigned Intellectual Property. Nothing contained in this Intellectual Property Agreement shall be deemed to supersede any of the obligations, agreements, representations, covenants or warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Intellectual Property Agreement is subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement except as explicitly stated herein. This Intellectual Property Agreement is intended only to document the assignment of the Assigned Intellectual Property; however, in cases of direct conflict between this agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement, this Intellectual Property Agreement will govern. Nothing contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to supersede any of the obligations, agreements, representations, covenants or warranties explicitly defined in this Intellectual Property Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction. The original text states that the Intellectual Property Agreement is entirely subject to the Asset Purchase Agreement and cannot supersede it. The modified text states that in cases of conflict, the Intellectual Property Agreement will govern, contradicting the original statement. This introduces uncertainty as to which agreement takes precedence in case of conflicting terms, potentially leading to disputes over intellectual property rights.",

Seller is under no obligation to comply with requests from the Buyer regarding intellectual property.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by removing the Buyer's ability to make requests regarding the Assigned Intellectual Property and explicitly stating that the seller has no obligation to comply with requests from the Buyer, while the original agreement indicates obligations to both Backhaul and the Buyer. The change implies that Backhaul has sole authority over the Assigned Intellectual Property, which contradicts other parts of the Asset Purchase Agreement which include the Buyer. This may cause legal issues and creates uncertainty.",

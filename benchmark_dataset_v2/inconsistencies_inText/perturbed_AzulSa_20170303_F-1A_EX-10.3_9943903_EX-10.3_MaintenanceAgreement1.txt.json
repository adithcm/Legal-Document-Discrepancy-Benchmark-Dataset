The first line of section 12.2 mandates payments within 60 days, while the 'For the sake of clarity' paragraph at the end states payments are due within 30 days. This contradiction creates uncertainty and potential for disputes regarding payment deadlines.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states payment within 30 days in section 12.2(i). However, the added phrase 'unless otherwise specified in Exhibit 14' introduces a loophole, while the 'For the sake of clarity' now states 60 days for payment. This creates a direct contradiction and uncertainty, as the reader is unsure whether the payment deadline is 30 days (per original section) or potentially different due to Exhibit 14 or 60 days for clarity.",

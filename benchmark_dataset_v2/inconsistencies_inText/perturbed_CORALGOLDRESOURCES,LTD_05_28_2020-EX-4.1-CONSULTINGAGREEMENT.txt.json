                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction regarding the notice period and termination payment required when the Company terminates the agreement. Initially, the company had to provide 3 months' notice and a termination payment. Now, it only requires 1 months' notice with no termination payment. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes over termination conditions.",

However, the Company reserves the right to reduce the Consulting Fee to $5,000 per month at any time with 30 days written notice to the Consultant.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by allowing the Company to unilaterally reduce the Consulting Fee. The original clause specifies a fixed monthly fee, but the added sentence allows for a potential reduction, creating ambiguity and uncertainty about the actual compensation the Consultant will receive. This can lead to disputes regarding payment terms.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction to the confidentiality clause. The original clause strictly prohibits the use or disclosure of Confidential Information without prior written consent. The added sentence, however, allows disclosure to potential investors without consent, creating an exception that conflicts with the initial prohibition. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes about what information is truly confidential.",

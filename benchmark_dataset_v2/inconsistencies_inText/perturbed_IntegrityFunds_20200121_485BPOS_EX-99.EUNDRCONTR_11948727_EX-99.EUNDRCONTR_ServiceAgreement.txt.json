This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days' written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).",

The Fund can now terminate with 30 days' notice (down from 60), while Integrity requires 120 days' notice (up from 90). This creates uncertainty and potential disputes over the valid termination date.",

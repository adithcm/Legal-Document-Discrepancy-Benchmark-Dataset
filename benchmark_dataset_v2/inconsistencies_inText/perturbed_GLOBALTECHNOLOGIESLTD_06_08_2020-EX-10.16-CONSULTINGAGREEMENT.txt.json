This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for one (1) year or until Consultant completes the services requested. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be the date such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party.",

Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party.

                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction regarding termination rights. Initially, either party could terminate with notice. Now, the company requires 30 days' notice for termination, while the consultant can terminate with no prior notice, creating an imbalance and uncertainty about the actual termination process.",

As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity regarding how the compensation will be treated. Initially, the cash compensation *shall* be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note. Now, it states that the cash compensation *may* be treated as a reduction, at the Company's discretion, and the payout for inventory sales *will not* reduce the principal on the Jetco Note. This contradicts the previous mandatory reduction and introduces uncertainty and potential for disputes over how the compensation impacts the Note.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction by limiting the applicability of the attorney's fees clause. Initially, it applied to the entire agreement. Now, it explicitly applies only to disputes arising under Sections 1 through 5. This creates uncertainty about whether attorneys' fees and costs can be recovered for breaches of other sections (e.g., confidentiality, non-circumvention), potentially discouraging enforcement of those provisions and causing disputes about the scope of the fee recovery.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for one (1) year or until Consultant completes the services requested. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be the date such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party.",

Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with thirty (30) days written notice, and the effective date of termination shall be thirty (30) days after such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement lasts for one year or until the consultant completes requested services, implying different potential durations. The change removes the 'until Consultant completes...' clause, fixing the term to one year, but then adds a 30-day notice period for termination, conflicting with the 'without notice' clause for bankruptcy etc., creating ambiguity regarding termination conditions.",

                "original_text": "As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition.",
                "changed_text": "As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000.00 cash compensation. The Consultant may earn additional compensation, including but not limited to, a percentage of profits from the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019, as determined solely by the Company. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall not be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by both parties. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be determined at the sole discretion of the Company, and there is no guarantee of additional compensation.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines a fixed compensation and a clear method of reducing the Jetco Note principal. The modification introduces ambiguity by giving the Company sole discretion over additional compensation, potentially contradicting the initial 'entire compensation' statement. Also, specifying that cash compensation may or may not be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company creates uncertainty.",

If they do not reach such solution within a period of 60 days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions, or differences shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules.

The modification allows either party to immediately pursue litigation, contradicting the mediation/arbitration clause. Furthermore, there are now two choice of venue that are both claiming to be the location for all disputes arising under the terms of this agreement.",

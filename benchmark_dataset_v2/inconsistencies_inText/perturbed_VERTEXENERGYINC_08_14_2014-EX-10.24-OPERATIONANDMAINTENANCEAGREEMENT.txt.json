Operator may terminate this Agreement at any time upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the dissolution or bankruptcy of Owner; (b) Owner fails to pay when due any amount due and payable hereunder, including, without limitation, any interest, fees, reimbursements or indemnifications, and such failure shall continue for a period of 15 days after the due date thereof; or (c) other than as set forth in clause (b) above, Owner breaches or fails to observe or perform any material term, condition, or obligation contained in this Agreement and fails to correct, or fails to diligently pursue correction of, such breach within 60 days after receipt of written notice from Operator of any such breach.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in payment terms. Clause (b) initially states a 15-day grace period for payments, after which Operator can terminate. The modified clause (b) extends this grace period to 90 days, creating a contradiction. It becomes unclear whether a 15-day or 90-day delay triggers termination rights, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

The original text allows for 60 days to correct a breach as per clause (c) and 7 days written notice per (e). The modified text in clause (c) shortens the correction period to 30 days, and extends the without cause termination to 30 days written notice as per (e), creating a contradiction. It is now unclear if the operator has 60 or 30 days to correct any breach and how much notice they will receive prior to termination, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

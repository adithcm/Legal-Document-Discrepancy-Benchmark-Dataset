                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such specified Person through one or more intermediaries or otherwise. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means, where used with respect to any Person, the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of Voting Securities or interests, by contract or otherwise, and the terms \"controlling\" and \"controlled\" have correlative meanings.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that is strategically aligned with, or collaborates in a joint venture with, such specified Person. Affiliates may or may not share common ownership. For the purposes of this definition, 'control' is not a requirement for affiliate status. The existence of a strategic partnership or joint marketing agreement shall be sufficient to establish affiliate status.",
                "explanation": "The original definition defines 'Affiliate' based on direct or indirect control, typically ownership. The modified definition broadens this to include strategic alignment and collaborations without requiring control. This creates a contradiction as the original definition is precise and ownership-based, while the modified definition is vague and partnership-based. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as different sections of the contract may rely on different definitions, leading to disputes over which entities are considered affiliates and the rights and obligations that extend to them.",

Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement, Owner hereby authorizes and empowers Operator, and Operator agrees, in the name of and on behalf of Owner, to, at its sole cost and expense, keep and maintain the Rail Facility in a condition and repair similar to, but not less than, its condition and repair on the Effective Date hereof.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Operator is responsible for the maintenance of the Rail Facility at its sole cost and expense, while the modified text shifts the financial responsibility to the Owner. This creates a direct contradiction concerning which party bears the cost of maintaining the Rail Facility, creating uncertainty in enforcement because both parties may claim the other is responsible for covering these expenses.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the Owner *may* reimburse the Operator for unamortized capital expenditure if the Agreement is terminated without cause, indicating discretion. However, the modified text changes 'may' to 'shall', making the reimbursement mandatory. This introduces an in-text contradiction as it is now unclear whether the Owner has the option or the obligation to provide reimbursement, creating uncertainty in enforcement and potentially leading to disputes regarding reimbursement obligations.",

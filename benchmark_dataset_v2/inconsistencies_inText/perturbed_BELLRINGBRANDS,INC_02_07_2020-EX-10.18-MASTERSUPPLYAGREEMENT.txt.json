Purchase Orders not received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time are considered to be received on the following business day. Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within [***] of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected in writing within such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier.

Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within [***] of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected in writing within such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier.

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by adding a clause that allows the supplier an additional [***] days to reject a purchase order, even after the initial rejection period has passed. This contradicts the original statement that orders not rejected within the initial timeframe are 'deemed confirmed and accepted,' creating uncertainty and potential disputes over order acceptance.",

Either party can terminate this agreement with a written notice of 30 days before the end of the term.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a contradictory clause, allowing either party to terminate with only 30 days' notice before the end of the term. This directly conflicts with the earlier statement requiring a 12-month notice period for non-renewal, creating ambiguity about the actual termination requirements.",

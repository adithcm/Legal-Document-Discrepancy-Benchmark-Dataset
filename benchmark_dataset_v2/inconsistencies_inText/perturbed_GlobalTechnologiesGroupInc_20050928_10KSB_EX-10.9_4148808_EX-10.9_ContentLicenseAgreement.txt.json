All payments hereunder shall be payable to IMNTV in United States Dollars on a quarterly basis upon receipt from the wireless carriers in the Territory, except as follows:\n\n(a) First Payment. The first payment to IMNTV will be payable upon receipt at the end of the first calendar quarter after Launch, and will include any amounts due, pro-rated based on the number of days in such period of time; and\n\n(b) Last Payment. The last payment to IMNTV will be payable upon receipt at the end of the first full month after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and will include any amounts due: for the last month that the Programming is available, prorated based on the number of days in such final period.",

All payments hereunder shall be payable to IMNTV in United States Dollars on a quarterly basis upon receipt from the wireless carriers in the Territory, except as follows:\n\n(a) First Payment. The first payment to IMNTV will be payable upon receipt 90 days after the end of the first calendar quarter after Launch, and will include any amounts due, pro-rated based on the number of days in such period of time; and\n\n(b) Last Payment.

                "explanation": "The change to section 6.2(a) introduces a contradiction by specifying that the first payment is due 90 days after the quarter, rather than at the end of the first quarter. This creates uncertainty about when the initial payment is actually due, creating an enforcement problem.",

                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the original clause by removing the requirement for a 30-day written notice and cure period before termination due to a material breach. This introduces significant uncertainty, as it's now unclear whether a party can immediately terminate the agreement upon any perceived material breach, potentially leading to disputes over the validity of termination.",

                "explanation": "This modification has two contradictions. Firstly, it changes the nature of the license from 'non-exclusive' to 'exclusive,' contradicting the possibility of IMNTV licensing the same content to other distributors in the same territory. Secondly, it changes the length of continuous programming excerpts from 60 seconds to 30 seconds. This creates uncertainty about the extent of distributor's rights and introduces discrepancies in the marketing material the distributor can create.",

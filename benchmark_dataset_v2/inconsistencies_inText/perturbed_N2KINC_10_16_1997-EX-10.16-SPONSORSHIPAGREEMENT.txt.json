                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. The original text specifies a strict payment schedule with specific dates and amounts. The added sentence grants Sponsor the option to delay payments by up to 90 days without penalty. This directly contradicts the established payment schedule, creating uncertainty about the actual payment deadlines and enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that all accrued payments must be paid within 30 days of termination. The added phrase allows for the parties to negotiate a different payment schedule at termination. This creates uncertainty and potential contradiction, as the 'otherwise negotiated' terms could conflict with the original 30-day requirement, making it unclear which deadline applies.",

Sponsor will promptly notify Excite of any errors, failures or outages of the Co-Branded Area. However, either party can terminate this agreement immediately if the other party experiences any downtime related to content delivery.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for termination after a 30-day uncured breach. The added sentence enables immediate termination for any content delivery downtime. This is a contradiction as it suggests one type of breach requires a 30 day window for rectification and another similar type allows for immediate termination, without accounting for the severity or the impact of the breach.",

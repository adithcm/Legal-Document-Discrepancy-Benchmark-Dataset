In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows:\n\nAt the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the quarterly fee shall be paid 'during the following month.' The modified text changes this to 'within 60 days of the quarter's end.' This introduces ambiguity as 'during the following month' implies a shorter timeframe than 'within 60 days', creating uncertainty about the exact due date of payment.",

                "explanation": "The original text states FIIOC can terminate with ninety (90) days' notice, but the modified text changes this to thirty (30) days' notice. This introduces conflicting terms regarding the notice period required for termination by FIIOC.",

                "explanation": "The original text states a successor is 'bound by the terms of this Agreement'. The modified text allows the successor to 'renegotiate the terms' which directly contradicts the original binding agreement, creating an in-text contradiction. This makes it unclear whether the successor is bound by the existing terms or has the right to change them.",

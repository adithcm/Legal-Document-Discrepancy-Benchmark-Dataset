Unless terminated pursuant to Section 10 or 11 below, it shall expire upon the earlier of the date specified in Exhibit \"B\" or upon the opening of the last El Pollo Loco® Restaurant listed in the Development Schedule.",

Unless terminated pursuant to Section 10 or 11 below, it shall expire exactly five (5) years from the commencement date, regardless of the date specified in Exhibit \"B\" or the opening of the last El Pollo Loco® Restaurant listed in the Development Schedule.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a contradiction regarding the expiration date of the agreement. The original text states that the agreement expires upon the earlier of the date specified in Exhibit B or upon opening of the last restaurant. The changed text stipulates a fixed five-year term, irrespective of Exhibit B or the development schedule, creating uncertainty about the agreement's actual duration and enforcement.",

In such event, the Development Fee shall be forfeited to Franchisor in consideration of the rights granted in the Territory up to the time of termination. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, unless earlier terminated by either party, this Agreement shall expire on ______, 20___, and all rights of Developer herein shall cease and all unapplied or unused Development Fees paid pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall be forfeited to Franchisor.",
                "changed_text": "10. Termination by Developer; Expiration Date.\n\n10.1. This Agreement shall terminate immediately upon Developer providing thirty (30) days written notice to El Pollo Loco. In such event, a pro-rated portion of the Development Fee shall be refunded to Developer, calculated based on the number of restaurants opened versus those planned. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, unless earlier terminated by either party, this Agreement shall expire on ______, 20___, and all rights of Developer herein shall cease and all unapplied or unused Development Fees paid pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall be forfeited to Franchisor.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates a contradiction related to the conditions and financial consequences of early termination by the developer. Originally, the development fee is forfeited upon termination by the developer. The modified text states a pro-rated portion will be refunded. This directly conflicts with the original condition, leading to uncertainty about the actual financial responsibilities upon developer-initiated termination and making enforcement unclear.",

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ANY COURT, WHETHER FEDERAL OR STATE, WILL BE BROUGHT WITHIN THE STATE IN WHICH FRANCHISOR'S HEADQUARTERS (CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA) IS THEN LOCATED.

                "explanation": "The modified text creates a contradiction by switching the governing law and venue from the Franchisor's headquarters to the Developer's principal place of business. The original text states that actions will be brought in the state of the Franchisor's headquarters, but the altered text shifts this to the Developer's location. Additionally, the waiver of class action lawsuits is removed, allowing for class action lawsuits, so long as they benefit both parties, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over which laws and procedures apply and where disputes must be resolved.",

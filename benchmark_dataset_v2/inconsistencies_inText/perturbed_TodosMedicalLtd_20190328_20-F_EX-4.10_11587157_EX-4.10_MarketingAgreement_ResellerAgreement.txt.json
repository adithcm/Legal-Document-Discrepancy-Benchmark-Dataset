                "original_text": "5.7 Payment for Products. Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than thirty (30) days from the date of shipment. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",
                "changed_text": "5.7 Payment for Products. Todos shall invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller shall pay such sums by no later than thirty (30) days from the date of shipment. However, if the Reseller utilizes a third-party payment platform, the payment deadline is extended to sixty (60) days from the date of the invoice. All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. The original clause states a strict 30-day payment term from the shipment date. The modified clause adds an exception, extending the payment deadline to 60 days if a third-party payment platform is used. This creates uncertainty about which payment term applies, potentially leading to disputes over late fees and contract enforcement.",

Todos shall ship ordered Products to the Reseller within ninety (90) days of Todos's acceptance of the applicable purchase order DAP Reseller's warehouse (Incoterms 2010), provided that Reseller's order for the Products does not deviate from the applicable Forecast by more than ten percent (10%).",

However, if Todos experiences any delays in obtaining necessary components for the Products, the delivery timeframe may be extended by an additional thirty (30) days without penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the delivery timeline. Initially, the contract stipulates a 90-day delivery period after order acceptance, assuming the order aligns with forecasts. The added clause allows for a potential 30-day extension due to component delays, creating ambiguity about the enforceable delivery deadline. This could lead to disputes if delays occur and the Reseller argues for the original 90-day timeframe.",

Upon completion of the Initial Term, provided that the Reseller has achieved the Annual Milestones, the term of the Agreement shall be automatically renewed for an additional five (5) years.

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction regarding the renewal conditions of the agreement. The original text stipulates that the agreement automatically renews for five years only if the Reseller achieves the Annual Milestones. The altered text states that the agreement will renew regardless of Milestone achievement, creating ambiguity about what is required for automatic renewal. This could lead to disputes concerning whether the agreement should be automatically renewed if the Reseller has not met the Annual Milestones.",

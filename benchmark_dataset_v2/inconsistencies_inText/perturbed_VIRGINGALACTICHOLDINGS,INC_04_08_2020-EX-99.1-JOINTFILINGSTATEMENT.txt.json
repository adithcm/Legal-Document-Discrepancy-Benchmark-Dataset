The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments; however, the responsibility for the accuracy of the information concerning each party is shared equally amongst all undersigned parties. Each party is only responsible for the completeness of information directly pertaining to them.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the accuracy of information is shared equally amongst all undersigned parties, which conflicts with the original text stating that each party is only responsible for the accuracy of their own information, unless they have reason to believe others' information is inaccurate. This creates uncertainty about the extent of liability and responsibility of each party.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a liability limitation for SCULPTOR CAPITAL LP. This contradicts the earlier assumption of joint responsibility in paragraph 1, as it carves out a specific and low penalty limit for one of the parties, therefore making enforcement difficult.",

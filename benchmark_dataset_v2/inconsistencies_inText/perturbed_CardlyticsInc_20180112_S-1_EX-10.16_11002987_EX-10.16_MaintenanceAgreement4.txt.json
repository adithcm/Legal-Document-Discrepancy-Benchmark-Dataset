                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that maintenance fees will be charged based on Time and Materials, while the original text stated it would be provided at no charge.

The original text states that fees are paid in increments described in \"Payment Terms\" during the initial and renewal terms. The modified text introduces uncertainty for renewal terms, stating fees are subject to negotiation and may not follow the same increments, thus conflicting with the initial assertion.",

However, maintenance during Bank of America holidays will be provided on a best-effort basis and may incur additional charges, unless provided under the original service level agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction. The original text states that maintenance is provided 24/7, including Bank of America holidays, without exception. The modified text creates an exception for holidays, stating that maintenance is provided on a best-effort basis and may incur additional charges during those times, thus conflicting with the earlier statement.",

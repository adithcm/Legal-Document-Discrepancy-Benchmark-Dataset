                "original_text": "4.2Payment Terms. Unless otherwise agreed to by ESTABLISHMENT in writing, ESTABLISHMENT shall invoice APOLLO for Product ordered at the time of shipment and APOLLO shall pay each invoice within thirty (30) days from date of invoice. Each invoice shall set forth, in U.S. Dollars, the applicable price for the shipment properly determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If APOLLO disputes any portion of an invoice received from ESTABLISHMENT the Parties shall use good faith efforts to reconcile the disputed amounts as soon as practicable. Invoices should be sent to the physical and email addresses as specified in writing by APOLLO in the applicable Purchase Order.",

Unless otherwise agreed to by ESTABLISHMENT in writing, ESTABLISHMENT shall invoice APOLLO for Product ordered at the time of shipment and APOLLO shall pay each invoice within sixty (60) days from date of invoice. Each invoice shall set forth, in U.S. Dollars, the applicable price for the shipment properly determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If APOLLO disputes any portion of an invoice received from ESTABLISHMENT the Parties shall use good faith efforts to reconcile the disputed amounts as soon as practicable. Invoices should be sent to the physical and email addresses as specified in writing by APOLLO in the applicable Purchase Order.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by modifying the payment term from 'thirty (30) days' to 'sixty (60) days'. This directly conflicts with any clause referencing the original 30-day payment window, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within thirty (30) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement. APOLLO has the right to reject, via written notification to ESTABLISHMENT within this thirty (30) day period, any or all of a shipment of Product that fails to satisfy any warranty in this Agreement and may reject all of a given Lot of Product if a statistical sample does not meet the Specifications. Upon confirmation of defective condition by ESTABLISHMENT and issuance of a return material authorization (\"RMA\") number, APOLLO shall be entitled to the immediate return and replacement, free of charge, of any Product supplied by ESTABLISHMENT in breach of any warranty under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5.4Acceptance, Rejection, and Claims. APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within fifteen (15) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement.

                "explanation": "This perturbation changes the inspection and rejection period from 'thirty (30) business days' to 'fifteen (15) business days'. This directly contradicts any reference to a 30-day acceptance period elsewhere in the contract or related exhibits, causing confusion about the allowable timeframe for quality control.",

Each Party agrees not to use the Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose, including trading in the financial instruments of the other Party, except in its performance under this Agreement.

The receiving Party agrees to take appropriate measures by instruction and/or written agreement prior to disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees and contractors to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure. Confidential Information may be disclosed to the extent necessary to comply with an order of an administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction provided, however, that the Party so required to disclose Confidential Information shall provide prior written notice thereof to the other Party in sufficient time to enable that Party to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure. The receiving Party's confidentiality obligations under this Article 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and shall remain binding on the Parties hereto until the earlier of a) the Confidential Information falls within one of the exceptions stated in Section 9.1 and b) five (5) years from the expiration or termination of the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The change modifies the confidentiality period post-termination from 'five (5) years' to 'two (2) years'. This creates a direct contradiction that makes the contract ambiguous, especially in instances where there are other paragraphs or sections referring back to the original duration of the confidentiality obligations, thereby creating uncertainty.",

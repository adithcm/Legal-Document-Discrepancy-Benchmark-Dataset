                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the payment deadline. The original text specifies 180 days, while the modified text states 90 days. This creates uncertainty about the actual due date and potential for disputes.",

The original text specifies mediation in a mutually agreed-upon third country, but the modified text requires arbitration in Beijing, removing the possibility of mediation and introducing a specific, potentially biased, location for dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "The payment deadline is changed from 180 days to 90 days creating a direct conflict with the original term. This inconsistency introduces uncertainty and potential disputes over when the payment is actually due.",

The amount is payable 180 days from the date of the Event.\nACM may request immediate payment in full if SLD resales more than 50% of the sponsorship components to other buyers.",
                "explanation": "While the original text states payment is due 180 days after the event, the added sentence grants ACM the right to demand immediate payment under specific conditions. This creates a contradiction as it is now unclear whether SLD has the full 180 days or whether ACM can accelerate the payment based on resale activity. The exact mechanism for triggering this clause is vague. ",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates mediation in a mutually agreed third country. The modified clause demands arbitration in Beijing. These clauses are contradictory because mediation and arbitration are different dispute resolution processes, and the location is also different. This leads to confusion and potential disputes on how disagreements should be resolved.",

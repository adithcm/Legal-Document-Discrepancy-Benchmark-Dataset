                "explanation": "The modified text introduces a contradiction by changing the disbursement schedule of donated amounts. Initially, it's quarterly for the entire term. Now, it's quarterly for the first year, then annually. This creates ambiguity regarding the payment terms after the first year, leading to potential disputes. In addition, it also contradicts the reporting structure, creating further ambiguity.",

Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period by written notification to the NFLA-NC representative, and the Company's internal records will be the sole determinant of whether a product is considered a 'Licensed Product'. All parties agree that an amendment to the agreement will NOT be necessary.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original clause requiring a written amendment signed by all parties to add new products to the 'Licensed Products' list. The modified text now allows the Company to add products by simply notifying the NFLA-NC representative, and the Company's records are the determinant if a product is considered 'Licensed Product', creating uncertainty and removes the other parties' control over which products are subject to the agreement's terms. This creates potential for dispute and ambiguity.",

However, in the event of a conflict between this Addendum and the original agreement, the Company's interpretation shall prevail.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction by stating that the Addendum is enforceable under the terms of the original agreement, but then gives the Company the final say in interpretation if there's a conflict. This undermines the concept of mutual agreement and could lead to the Company unilaterally altering the terms of the agreement to its advantage, creating legal uncertainty for NFLA and NFLA-NC.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by changing the payment terms. It overrides and shortens the payment window mentioned in original terms in Section 8.5(a) from the original term to 15 days. This contradicts the term in section (a) that says it should be paid within the defined period days. This introduces legal uncertainty and potential disputes over obligations.",

                "explanation": "The change introduces an in-text contradiction by adding the line 'Bellicum is not liable for any fee what so ever' but keeps the line about late fee, thus creating an inconsistency and causing uncertainty over the term regarding late fee payment obligations.",

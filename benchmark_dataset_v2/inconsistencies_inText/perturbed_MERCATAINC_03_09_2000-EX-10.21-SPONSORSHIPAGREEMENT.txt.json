                "original_text": "3.1. Invoices and Payment. FNW will send Sponsor invoices Sponsorship Fee in -------------------- two (2) monthly installments beginning September 1, 1999. Invoices are payable thirty (30) days after receipt. A five percent (5%) late fee will be added to all invoices which become past due and interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum will be charged on all balances not paid within thirty (30) days of the date they are due.",
                "changed_text": "3.1. Invoices and Payment. FNW will send Sponsor invoices Sponsorship Fee in -------------------- two (2) monthly installments beginning September 1, 1999. Invoices are payable sixty (60) days after receipt. A five percent (5%) late fee will be added to all invoices which become past due and interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum will be charged on all balances not paid within thirty (30) days of the date they are due.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The first sentence states invoices are payable within 60 days, while the subsequent sentence states that interest is charged on balances not paid within 30 days. This creates ambiguity about when late fees and interest apply, making the enforcement of payment deadlines uncertain.",

The term of this Agreement shall commence on July 19, 1999 and shall ---- thereafter continue until all above described Sponsor benefits are completed, but in no event beyond the end of the 1999 season (the \"Term\"). This Agreement is noncancellable by either party except for termination in accordance with Paragraph 7, below, and may be mutually extended by written agreement of the parties.",

This Agreement is noncancellable by either party. However, it can be terminated with a 30-day written notice and may be mutually extended by written agreement of the parties.",
                "explanation": "The modified text creates a contradiction by stating that the agreement is initially noncancellable. However, it later asserts that it 'can be terminated with a 30-day written notice.' This contradiction introduces legal uncertainty about the actual cancellation possibilities. Is it cancellable, or is it not? This can be a point of dispute.",

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or ------------------- obligations of either FNW or Sponsor hereunder may be assigned, transferred or conveyed by operation of law or otherwise by either party, nor shall such agreements or rights inure to the benefit of any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, creditor, or trustee of either party's business or its properties whether by operation of law or otherwise, except with the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the delivery of a written document in which the assignee assumes all of the obligations of the assigning party and the assigning party acknowledges that it will continue to be bound to such obligations if not performed by the assignee. For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the transfer of a fifty percent (50%) or greater ownership interest in a party shall be deemed to be an assignment of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assignment or attempted assignment by Sponsor shall be valid except to a party which intends to continue the business of Sponsor as presently conducted. Sponsor does hereby consent to any transfer or assignment by FNW of its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate of FNW without any additional prior consent of Sponsor. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of all successors and assigns of the parties.",
                "changed_text": "11. Successor Interests. This Agreement and all rights and obligations may be freely assigned, transferred or conveyed by either party. Notification of assignment is sufficient, and written consent is not required. The assigning party will not retain any obligations after assignment. For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the transfer of a twenty-five percent (25%) or greater ownership interest in a party shall be deemed to be an assignment of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of all successors and assigns of the parties.",
                "explanation": "The changed text directly contradicts the original restrictions on assignment. Initially, assignment required consent, and the assignor remained liable. Now, assignment is unrestricted, consent is unnecessary, and the assignor has no further obligations. This introduces significant ambiguity about assignment rights and responsibilities. The ownership interest has also been changed from 50% to 25%.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",

However, none of the undersigned shall be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, or concerning the other, regardless of whether she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that none of the undersigned are responsible for the accuracy of their own or others' information, directly conflicting with the previous clause that assigns responsibility for their own information and imposes a limited responsibility for others' information. This creates uncertainty about who is liable for inaccuracies.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D. Filing with the applicable regulatory authorities, and any future amendments thereto, is optional and at the sole discretion of each undersigned party. The reporting of each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein is encouraged but not required, and this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed as a courtesy and not pursuant to or in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original agreement to jointly *file* the schedule and amendments with regulatory authorities, by stating that filing is now optional and at each party's discretion. It also states that reporting ownership is encouraged but not required and that the filing isn't subject to the Securities Exchange Act, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over the obligation to file accurate and timely reports and whether that obligation even exists.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be fully responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of all information contained therein, including information concerning the other.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the responsibility for accuracy. The original text states each party is only responsible for their own information, unless they know the other's is inaccurate. The revised text makes each party fully responsible for ALL information, including the other's, regardless of knowledge. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes about liability for inaccurate information.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that timely filing of such amendments is optional, and accuracy of the information is not guaranteed. Each party is encouraged to review the filing, but assumes no responsibility for errors or omissions. Filing this agreement constitutes a good faith effort but does not create any legal obligation.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the core purpose of the Joint Filing Agreement. The original text establishes a clear obligation for timely filing and accuracy. The altered text makes filing optional, disclaims responsibility for accuracy, and suggests no legal obligation exists. This creates significant legal ambiguity and undermines the enforceability of the agreement. It conflicts with the initial affirmation of filing in accordance with SEC rules.",

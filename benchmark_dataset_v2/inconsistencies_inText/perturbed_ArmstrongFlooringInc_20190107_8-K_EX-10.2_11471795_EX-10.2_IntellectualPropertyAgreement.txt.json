(a) Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, the term of this Agreement and the licenses and other grants of rights (and related obligations) under this Agreement shall (i) with respect to the Arizona Licensed Trademarks, be for the Arizona Trademark License Term, (ii) with respect to the Diamond Licensed Trademarks, be for the Diamond Trademark License Term, (iii) with respect to the Phase- Out Marks, be for the term set forth in Section 6.6, and (iv) with respect to Copyrights, Know-How and Patents, be in perpetuity.",

(a) Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, the term of this Agreement and the licenses and other grants of rights (and related obligations) under this Agreement shall (i) with respect to the Arizona Licensed Trademarks, be for the Arizona Trademark License Term, (ii) with respect to the Diamond Licensed Trademarks, be for the Diamond Trademark License Term, (iii) with respect to the Phase- Out Marks, be for the term set forth in Section 6.6, and (iv) with respect to Copyrights, Know-How and Patents, be for an initial term of five (5) years, with automatic renewal for successive one (1) year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction. The original text states that the licenses for Copyrights, Know-How, and Patents are 'in perpetuity,' meaning they last forever. The modified text states that these licenses have an initial term of five years with renewal options, which directly conflicts with the concept of perpetuity. This creates uncertainty regarding the duration of these key licenses and potential disputes over termination.",

Any assignment or other disposition in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void.",
                "explanation": "The added text creates a contradiction within the assignment clause. Originally, the provided clauses (b) and (c), state that no assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations under the agreement. However, this has been changed to the assignment shall relieve the assigning party. This contradicts the previous section of the text and can create ambiguity on who is responsible.",

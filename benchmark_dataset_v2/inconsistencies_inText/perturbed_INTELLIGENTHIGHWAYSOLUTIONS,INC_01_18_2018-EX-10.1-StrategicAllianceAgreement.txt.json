                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and delivered through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by Fazync at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 30 days after each client payment on delivered products received at Fazync bank account. Payments will be made NET 45 days after client payment is received.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'payable NET 30 days', but the changed text modifies this to 'NET 45 days.' This creates a direct contradiction regarding the payment deadline, making it unclear which payment term is enforced. This inconsistency introduces uncertainty and potential disputes over payment timing.",

Such notice must be given sixty (60) days prior to expiration of the original term. This Agreement may also be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires ninety (90) days' notice prior to the expiration of the initial term for non-renewal, while the modified text changes this to sixty (60) days. This in-text contradiction creates ambiguity regarding the required notice period for non-renewal, leading to potential disputes if one party provides notice within the 60-day window but after the 90-day mark.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Fazync will indemnify Bravatek for negligence or intentional misconduct. The changed text modifies this to gross negligence or intentional misconduct. This creates a contradiction because now Bravatek only has to indemnify Fazync for negligence while Fazync only has to indemnify Bravatek for gross negligence. This creates ambiguity regarding the threshold of negligence that triggers indemnification and potential legal issues.",

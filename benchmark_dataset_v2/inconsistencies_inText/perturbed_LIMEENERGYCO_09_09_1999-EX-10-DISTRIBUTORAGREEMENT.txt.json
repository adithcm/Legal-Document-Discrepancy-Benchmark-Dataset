                "explanation": "This change introduces an in-text contradiction by modifying the original payment term of 30 days to 60 days. Later in section 4.2 (A) it states the agreement may be terminated if the distributor fails to make full and prompt payment. It is unclear if prompt payment means 30 or 60 days.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation compounds the original contradiction. Section 2.7 states payments must be made within 60 days now, however this section states that the agreement may be terminated if the payment is not 'full and prompt' and the company only has to provide 60 days of notice. This means after 60 days the contract can be terminated, but that is also when payment is expected. There is no additional time to cure the payment default.",

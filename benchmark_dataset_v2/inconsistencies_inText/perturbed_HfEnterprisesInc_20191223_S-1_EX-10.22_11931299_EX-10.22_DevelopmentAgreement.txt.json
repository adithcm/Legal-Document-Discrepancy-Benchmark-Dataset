As payment for Developer's satisfactory performance of the services set forth in Schedule 1 hereto (the \"Technology Development Services\"), DSS shall pay Developer the sum of US $23,000 per month, for the duration of the Term hereof, with payments to commence on March 1, 2018.",

Payments shall be made within 30 days of receipt of invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a specific payment deadline (30 days) that might conflict with other potential agreements or implied terms about payment timing. It also does not specify what happens if invoices are not received.",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of twelve (12) months (the \"Initial Term\"). The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30- days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any extension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the \"Term\".",

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of twelve (12) months (the \"Initial Term\"). The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30- days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. However, either party can terminate the agreement at any time after the initial 6 months with no penalty. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any extension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the \"Term\".",
                "explanation": "This edit introduces a contradiction regarding termination. While the original clause requires 30-day notice for termination after the initial term, the added sentence allows termination at any time after 6 months with no penalty. This creates ambiguity about the actual termination terms.",

However, Developer's liability for damages resulting from failure to provide functional and merchantable Improvements is limited to the total fees paid to Developer under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'without limitation', creating potentially unlimited liability. The addition limits this liability to the total fees paid, creating a contradiction. This makes the extent of developer liability ambiguous.",

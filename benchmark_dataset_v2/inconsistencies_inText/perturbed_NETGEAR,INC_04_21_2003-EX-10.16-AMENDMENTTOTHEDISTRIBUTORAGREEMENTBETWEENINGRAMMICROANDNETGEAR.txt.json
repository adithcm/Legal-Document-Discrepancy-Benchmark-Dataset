                "type": "Inconsistencies - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without prior written permission from the other party, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without such permission will be voidable.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without prior written permission from the other party, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without such permission will be automatically void and considered a breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that an attempted assignment without permission is 'voidable,' meaning the other party has the option to void it. The modified clause states that it's 'automatically void' and a breach. This creates a contradiction because one implies a choice, while the other is absolute and triggers further penalties. This could cause disputes over whether the non-assigning party has to actively void the assignment or if it's void regardless, and what constitutes a breach of contract.",

                "changed_text": "The terms and conditions of this Amendment, shall amend and supersede any conflicting terms of the original Agreement to the extent explicitly stated in this Amendment. All other terms of the original Agreement shall remain unchanged, however the original Agreement shall be read in the light most favorable to NETGEAR.",
                "explanation": "While the first part states that the amendment supersedes conflicting terms, adding 'to the extent explicitly stated in this Amendment' restricts its scope. The addition of 'the original Agreement shall be read in the light most favorable to NETGEAR' creates a contradiction because it introduces a bias that could conflict with other 'unchanged' terms meant to be neutral. It creates uncertainty about which parts of the original agreement are truly unchanged, and it introduces a bias that can be challenged.",

                "original_text": "During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date, Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*], subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a. For the purposes of this provision, distributor shall mean a company acquiring products directly from NETGEAR for resale or license to dealers or other second tier resellers which in turn resell or license the products to end use customers. The foregoing notwithstanding, during the [*] and any subsequent period, NETGEAR reserves the right to sell or license Products in [*] to customers other than distributors such as, but not limited to resellers who procure Products at centralized locations for resale to end-use customers solely through their wholly or majority owned retail outlets, both store-front and catalog. Following the [*], for any extension or renewal term, Distributor's appointment as Distributor shall be non-exclusive and NETGEAR may appoint other distributors in [*] at its sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "During the initial one year period beginning on the Amendment Date, Distributor shall be the only distributor appointed by NETGEAR in [*], subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a. For the purposes of this provision, distributor shall mean a company acquiring products directly from NETGEAR for resale or license to dealers or other second tier resellers which in turn resell or license the products to end use customers. The foregoing notwithstanding, during the [*] and any subsequent period, NETGEAR reserves the right to sell or license Products in [*] to any customer, subject to NETGEAR making reasonable efforts not to compete directly with the Distributor in sales to end-users where the Distributor had established customer relationships. Following the [*], for any extension or renewal term, Distributor's appointment as Distributor shall be non-exclusive and NETGEAR may appoint other distributors in [*] at its sole discretion, and the NETGEAR shall have complete control over pricing decisions.",
                "explanation": "Initially, NETGEAR reserves the right to sell to 'customers other than distributors' with a specific, limited exception. The changed text broadens this to 'any customer,' but adds a condition requiring 'reasonable efforts not to compete directly.' This creates a conflict because 'any customer' includes distributors, contradicting the exclusivity clause at the beginning. The addition of reasonable efforts is subjective and unenforceable. Additionally, the addtion of giving NETGEAR 'complete control over pricing decisions' contradicts the implied need to collaborate on pricing, as is common in distributorship agreements. These revisions introduce ambiguity and potential disputes over NETGEAR's sales and pricing rights, customer definitions, and the enforceability of the exclusivity clause.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the payment terms. The original text states that payments are due in 30 days, while the modified text adds an exception where larger invoices have 60 days to be paid. This creates ambiguity and could lead to disputes over payment deadlines.",

However, if the Minimum Revenue Target for year one is not achieved, then the quarterly payments for the subsequent year will automatically be reduced by 10% regardless of any renegotiation.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict by stating that if the minimum revenue target is not met, the quarterly payments will be automatically reduced by 10%, which contradicts the clause that states the parties will 'renegotiate in good faith a downward adjustment' instead. This creates uncertainty as to which action would be taken.",

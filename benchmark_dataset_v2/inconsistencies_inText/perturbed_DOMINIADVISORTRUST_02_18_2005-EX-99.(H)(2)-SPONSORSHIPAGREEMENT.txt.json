                "original_text": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",
                "changed_text": "For the services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by the Sponsor hereunder, the Trust shall pay Domini a fee accrued daily and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to 0.50% of the Trust's average daily net assets for the Trust's then current fiscal year. If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be a flat fee of $50,000 per month, regardless of the duration of service within the month. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.",
                "explanation": "The changed text introduces a conflict in the method of compensation. Initially, the compensation is based on a percentage of the Trust's average daily net assets, prorated for partial months. The modification introduces a flat monthly fee of $50,000, which contradicts the proration clause. This creates uncertainty about how Domini will be compensated for partial months of service, and which method applies under different circumstances. It directly conflicts with the previous sentence.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, except that if the Sponsor terminates the agreement within the first year, a termination fee of $100,000 will be due. Termination requires not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement can be terminated at any time without penalty. The modified text introduces a $100,000 termination fee if the Sponsor terminates the agreement within the first year. This creates a direct contradiction regarding whether a penalty is applicable in certain termination scenarios, causing uncertainty in enforcement.",

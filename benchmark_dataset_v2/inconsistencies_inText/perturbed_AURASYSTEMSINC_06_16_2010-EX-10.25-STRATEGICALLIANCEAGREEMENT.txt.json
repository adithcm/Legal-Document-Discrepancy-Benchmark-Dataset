                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by adding a clause that Aura must remit payment within 30 days of the invoice date, regardless of customer payment or product sale. This conflicts with the original clause which states Aura has no obligation to remit payment before fifteen (15) days following sale to a third-party of such Product nor shall Aura have any obligation to remit payment for any Product not sold by Aura. It creates uncertainty about the exact payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The added sentence stating \"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Aura may terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, upon providing thirty (30) days written notice to Zanotti.\" creates a contradiction with the rest of Section 7.2, which outlines specific events required for termination.

                "explanation": "By adding \"except for claims arising from Aura's gross negligence or willful misconduct\" to Aura's indemnity obligation, a conflict is created. The initial part of the section states that Aura will indemnify Zanotti against any breach, but the added exception limits that obligation. This introduces uncertainty regarding the extent of Aura's indemnity obligations and whether Aura is required to indemnify in case of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

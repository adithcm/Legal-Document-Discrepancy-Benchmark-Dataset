Aura shall remit payment to Zanotti for the invoiced price of any given Product within the earlier of: (i) fifteen (15) business days following Aura's receipt and acceptance of payment from its customer for such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated; or (ii)  forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of Aura's shipment to a customer of such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated.  Aura shall have no obligation to remit payment for any Product before fifteen (15) days following sale to a third-party of such Product nor shall  Aura have any obligation to remit payment for any Product not sold by Aura.",

Aura shall remit payment to Zanotti for the invoiced price of any given Product within the earlier of: (i) fifteen (15) business days following Aura's receipt and acceptance of payment from its customer for such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated; or (ii) forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of Aura's shipment to a customer of such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Aura shall remit payment within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, irrespective of whether Aura has received payment from its customer.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in payment terms. The original clause provides two conditions for payment, linked by 'earlier of', suggesting flexibility based on sales. The added sentence mandates payment within 30 days of the invoice date, regardless of customer payment, creating a contradiction and uncertainty about the actual payment deadline.",

                "explanation": "The added sentence creates a conflict with the minimum warranty period of 36 months. It allows Zanotti to offer shorter warranties for promotional purposes, contradicting the previously stated minimum and causing uncertainty about the actual warranty terms end-users will receive. This could lead to disputes about the applicable warranty period.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction regarding the conditions for termination. While section 7.2(d) initially allows either party to terminate with 60 days' notice, the added condition now restricts this right by requiring fulfillment of minimum obligations in Article 3. This conflicts the original intent of a simple termination clause and generates ambiguity.",

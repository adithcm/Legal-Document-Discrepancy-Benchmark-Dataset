Invoices shall be delivered to the invoiced Party        within three (3) days of the date of invoicing.",
                "changed_text": "5.5    Every invoice shall be reviewed by the invoiced Party and subject to        paragraphs 5.2, shall pay the invoice net fifteen (15) days from the        date of invoicing. Invoices shall be delivered to the invoiced Party        within thirty (30) days of the date of invoicing.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction by altering the invoice delivery timeframe. Section 5.5 initially states invoices should be delivered within three days, while another section states that invoices should be delivered within thirty days, creating uncertainty regarding the expected delivery timeline and potentially delaying payment.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation modifies the timeframe for accruing interest on overdue payments. Originally, interest applied after 30 days, but now it applies after 45 days. This directly conflicts with the initial payment term of net fifteen (15) days, as now there are now two different clauses referencing different time periods for payment and interest accrual.",

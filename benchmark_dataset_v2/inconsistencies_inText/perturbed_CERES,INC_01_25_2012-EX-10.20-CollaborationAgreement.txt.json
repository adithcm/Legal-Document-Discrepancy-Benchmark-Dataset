Each such invoice shall reflect only those costs that have been incurred in performance of the RESEARCH PROJECT and shall  provide a breakdown of costs similar to the detail set forth in the budget of the related SCHEDULE. CERES will pay all such invoices within thirty  (30) days after the invoice date.",

The original text specifies a payment term of thirty (30) days, while the modified text extends this period to sixty (60) days. This inconsistency creates uncertainty and potential disputes over which deadline is applicable, affecting the enforcement of payment terms.",

                "explanation": "This alteration generates an in-text conflict by changing the payment trigger from the 'invoice date' to the 'receipt of the invoice'. This creates ambiguity regarding when the payment timeline begins, potentially delaying payments and increasing disputes over adherence to payment terms.",

                "changed_text": "Terms of payment shall be net sixty (60) days.",
                "explanation": "This creates a direct contradiction with the later clause in section 12.7 that payment obligations survive termination, but are calculated based on a 30-day window, now contradicted by the 60-day window here.",

The provisions of Sections 1, 3.9, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of this Agreement, and all payment obligations incurred during the term of this Agreement, shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason. The provisions of Section 9 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for five (5) years. All other rights and obligations of the parties shall cease upon termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "12.7 Survival of Certain Terms. The provisions of Sections 1, 3.9, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of this Agreement, and all payment obligations incurred during the term of this Agreement, shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, except payment obligations. The provisions of Section 9 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for five (5) years. All other rights and obligations of the parties shall cease upon termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By explicitly excluding payment obligations from surviving the termination of the contract, this clause directly contradicts Section 6.1 and 6.2 which dictates payment terms and late payment charges. The contradiction introduces uncertainty as to whether the distributor is still liable for payments on products shipped before termination.",

                "original_text": "All amounts which are not timely paid by the Distributor as required by this Agreement shall be subject to a late charge equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or, if less, the maximum allowed by applicable law). In the event that any payment due hereunder is overdue, JRVS reserves the right to suspend performance until such delinquency is corrected.",

In the event that any payment due hereunder is overdue, JRVS will automatically terminate the agreement without notice.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a conflict by increasing the late payment charge from 1.5% to 5% and introducing immediate termination as a consequence of overdue payments. This conflicts with the termination clauses outlined in section 12 where there are stipulations on giving notice before termination for defaults.",

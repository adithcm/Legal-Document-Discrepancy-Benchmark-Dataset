                "changed_text": "4.2   Payment\n\nIBM invoices will specify the amount due. Payment is due upon receipt and payable as specified in such invoice. Customer agrees to pay accordingly, including any late payment fees. Payment will be made in United States dollars. Notwithstanding the above, for all invoices exceeding $100,000, payment shall be due 60 days from the date of invoice receipt.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline. The original clause states payment is due upon receipt, while the modified clause introduces a 60-day payment window for larger invoices. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding when payment is actually due, especially for invoices over $100,000, potentially leading to disputes over late payment fees.",

The breaching party will have thirty (30) days from receipt of notice to cure such breach, except for nonpayment by Customer, which must be cured within seven (7) business days from receipt of notice. If such breach has not been timely cured, then the non-breaching party may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice; provided, however, it is understood that in the event IBM has so breached this Agreement IBM shall not be entitled to recover the early termination charges described in Section 3.4(b) below.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a 7-day cure period for non-payment and allows immediate termination after that period. The modified text introduces a 60-day written notice requirement before IBM can terminate for Customer's breach. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the termination process and the timeline involved, particularly in cases of non-payment, leading to confusion and potential disputes regarding the enforceability of the termination clause.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allows the customer to terminate the agreement (or affected attachments) due to changes imposed by IBM, as long as the termination notice is given 30 days prior to the effective date of the change. However, the modified text introduces a constraint stating that the termination option must be exercised within 15 days of IBM's notice of change to avoid early termination penalties. This creates a contradiction because the original language seems to give the customer a window that lasts until 30 days before the effective date of changes, while the modified language significantly reduces that window to 15 days of the change notice, putting customer's at risk for early termination fees.",

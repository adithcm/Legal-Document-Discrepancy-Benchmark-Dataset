The Guarantee Forfeiture Payment may be recouped from Licensee's sales of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product and the IDIOCRACY Wireless Product, as set forth in Paragraphs 2(a)(ii) and 2(b)(i) of this Amendment.",

The Guarantee Forfeiture Payment may be recouped from Licensee's sales of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product and the IDIOCRACY Wireless Product, as set forth in Paragraphs 2(a)(ii) and 2(b)(i) of this Amendment. Notwithstanding the above, the Guarantee Forfeiture Payment is non-refundable and cannot be recouped under any circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating in one sentence that the Guarantee Forfeiture Payment can be recouped, and in the next sentence stating that it cannot be recouped under any circumstances, creating uncertainty and conflicting obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict regarding the obligation to pay royalties. The original text states that Licensee 'shall pay' royalties. The added sentence contradicts this by stating Licensee is not obligated to pay royalties for the first year, causing confusion about the actual payment terms.",

The modified text adds a contradictory statement that the release 'does not include claims related to intellectual property infringement.'

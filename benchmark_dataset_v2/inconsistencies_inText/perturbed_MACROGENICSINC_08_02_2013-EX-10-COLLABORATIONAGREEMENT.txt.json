                "changed_text": "8.8 Payment of Milestones. All milestone payments shall be due and payable within *** after the event for which the payment is due, unless otherwise specified in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a contradiction. While Section 8.8 says milestone payments are due within a certain period, sections 8.3 and 8.4 specify different payment timelines for clinical development and commercial milestones, creating confusion about which payment terms apply.",

                "original_text": "8.3 Clinical Development Milestone Payments. Green Cross shall pay to MacroGenics the milestone payments listed below, which shall be non-refundable, and non-creditable (unless otherwise stipulated under this Agreement). Any such milestone payments are subject to any credits, offsets and waivers specified by this Agreement.",

Green Cross shall pay to MacroGenics the milestone payments listed below, which shall be non-refundable, and non-creditable (unless otherwise stipulated under this Agreement). Any such milestone payments are subject to any credits, offsets and waivers specified by this Agreement, but some may be creditable at MacroGenics' discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a contradiction in the middle of the excerpt. While Section 8.3 initially states that milestone payments are 'non-creditable', the new text introduces an exception: 'but some may be creditable at MacroGenics' discretion.' This creates an ambiguity about the non-creditable nature of the payments, making it unclear whether Green Cross can expect any milestone payments to be creditable towards other financial obligations.",

Reports under this Section 8.9 shall be due on the ninetieth (90 ) day following the close of each Calendar Quarter.\n\n(ii) Royalties. Royalties shown to have accrued by each report shall, unless otherwise specified under this Agreement, be due and payable on the date such report is due.",

Royalties shown to have accrued by each report shall be due and payable on the date that is 30 days after such report is due.",
                "explanation": "While Section 8.9(b)(ii) initially states that royalties are due on the date the report is due, the new text specifies royalties are due 'on the date that is 30 days after such report is due.' This directly contradicts the original language and creates uncertainty about the actual payment deadline for royalties, leading to potential payment delays and disputes.",

However, NVOS reserves the right to defer payment for up to 24 months due to unforeseen financial constraints, subject to NVOS providing a written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by adding a clause that allows NVOS to defer payments, conflicting with the original agreement of annual payments commencing after 12 months. This creates uncertainty about the payment timeline and enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by changing the payment timeline in 12.2 from 'three months' to 'six months' of annual considerations, contradicting the original three-month timeline stated in section 12.1.

                "explanation": "The added sentence allows either party to terminate with 90 days written notice which directly contradicts that the agreement expires in five years unless all parties consent to earlier termination. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement since it becomes unclear whether the 5 year term is truly guaranteed.",

SCIEN shall pay HEMISPHERX for each order of Product within 75 days after receipt of the goods except for the for first purchase order which will be for 50 vials of Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived) (\"First Order\") and paid once the MOH approves the use for Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived) on 5 MERS patients. All purchase orders are final.",

SCIEN shall pay HEMISPHERX for each order of Product within 75 days after receipt of the goods except for the for first purchase order which will be for 50 vials of Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived) (\"First Order\") which is to be paid within 30 days of receipt. All purchase orders are final.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction. One clause states the first order payment is contingent on MOH approval. The other specifies a 30-day payment deadline irrespective of MOH approval. This creates ambiguity about the payment trigger and timeline for the first order.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the effective date of termination due to insolvency. Section B.3 now states termination is effective 60 days after notice for insolvency-related breaches, while Section C states that any breach termination is immediately effective. This creates uncertainty about when termination takes effect in cases of insolvency.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a clause granting SCIEN the right to immediate release of materials for market competitiveness. This directly contradicts the previous requirement of a 10-day review period, creating uncertainty about which clause governs the release of marketing materials. Is there always a review or does market competitiveness waive it?",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by modifying the payment deadline. The original text states invoices must be paid within 75 days, whereas the modified text shortens this period to 30 days. This creates ambiguity regarding which deadline should be enforced, leading to disputes over contractual obligations.",

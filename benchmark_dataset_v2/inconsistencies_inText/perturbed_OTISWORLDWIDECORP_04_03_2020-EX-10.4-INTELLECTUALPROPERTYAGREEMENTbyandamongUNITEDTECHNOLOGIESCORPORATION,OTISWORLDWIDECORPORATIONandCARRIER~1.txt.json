                "explanation": "The modification changes the definition of Performer Foreground-Delivered IPR from 'delivered' to 'intended to be delivered'. This creates a conflict because later sections rely on the actual delivery of the IPR, not the intention to deliver it, to determine ownership and licensing rights. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over whether certain Intellectual Property Rights are actually assigned or licensed.",

If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice, any Party desiring a non-negotiated resolution shall refer the Dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to the then-current commercial arbitration rules and supplementary procedures of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA Rules\"). The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules in any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not requested and the value of the relief any Party seeks (whether by claim or counterclaim) does not exceed three million United States dollars (US $3,000,000). In all other matters, including any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is requested, the arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a panel of three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. Each Party will bear its own expenses (including attorneys' fees), and the Parties will share equally the compensation and expenses of the arbitrators and the arbitration. Any arbitration award will be final and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the single arbitrator option and changes the cost-sharing arrangement for arbitration. Now, all matters seemingly require a panel of three arbitrators, regardless of the monetary value of the dispute, contradicting the previous clause. Additionally, it shifts the cost responsibility, creating a discrepancy. This creates uncertainty and disputes over the correct arbitration procedure and cost allocation.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'notwithstanding any provision to the contrary' at the start of section 9.2.1 and removal of 'freely' before the sale of intellectual property rights, makes the assignment now subject to express written approval of the other parties, conflicting with the following subsections allowing certain assignments without consent. The inclusion of requiring consent for any assignment creates an in-text contradiction within the same clause, making the initial freedom to assign assigned intellectual property rights void. Now every assignment requires written approval.",

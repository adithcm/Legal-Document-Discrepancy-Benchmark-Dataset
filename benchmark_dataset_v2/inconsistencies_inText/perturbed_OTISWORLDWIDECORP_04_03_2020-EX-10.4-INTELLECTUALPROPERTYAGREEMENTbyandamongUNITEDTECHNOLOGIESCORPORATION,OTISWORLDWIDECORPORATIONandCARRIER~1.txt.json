                "explanation": "This creates an in-text contradiction by changing the definition of Affiliate. The original text defines it as another member of the Party Group, while the modified text allows a Party to deem any entity as an affiliate. This can lead to uncertainty in enforcement as it becomes unclear which entities are actually considered affiliates for the purpose of the agreement.",

The original excerpt stipulates removal of trademarks within 3 years, but the modified version allows for continued usage beyond that period if all parties agree.

All references to \"Company\" or \"Companies\" in the JV Agreement will continue to include VNBJ even after the VNBJ Closing for matters related to pre-closing activities.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that references to VNBJ will continue to include VNBJ for pre-closing activities, directly contradicting the previous statement that the JV Agreement ceases to have any effect with respect to VNBJ after the closing. This creates uncertainty about the extent to which the original agreement still applies after the VNBJ Closing.",

However, this indemnification is only valid if the Directors and Officers continue to be employed by Nissin after the closing date.",
                "explanation": "This change adds a condition that the D&O indemnity is only valid if the Directors and Officers continue to be employed by Nissin after the closing date. This creates a contradiction because the original text does not impose any such condition and focuses on liabilities arising before the closing, regardless of post-closing employment status. This introduces uncertainty and potential disputes about the applicability of the indemnity.",

However, any claims for such breaches must be submitted within 30 days of the VNBJ or VNBZ Closing, otherwise they are waived.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a limitation on the timeframe for claims related to breaches of representations, warranties, etc. The original text states that termination does not release parties from liability for breaches before closing, but this addition introduces a 30-day claim submission deadline, after which claims are waived. This contradicts the original intent of not releasing parties from liability and creates uncertainty as to the enforceability of liabilities arising before the closing.",

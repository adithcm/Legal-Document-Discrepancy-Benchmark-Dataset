                "original_text": "Amounts not received within ten (10) days following their respective due dates shall be assessed a late charge equal to  one and one-half percent (1 _%) per month of the overdue amount until paid, commencing on the eleventh day.",
                "changed_text": "Amounts not received within ten (10) days following their respective due dates shall be assessed a late charge equal to  one and one-half percent (1 _%) per month of the overdue amount until paid, commencing on the eleventh day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no late charges shall be assessed if payment is received within thirty (30) days of the due date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the late payment terms. The original clause states late fees are assessed after ten days, while the modified clause adds that no late fees are assessed if paid within 30 days. This creates uncertainty about when late fees actually apply.",

North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein  may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by North within seven (7) business days  after receipt thereof.

North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein  may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by North within seven (7) business days  after receipt thereof. However, in certain situations, North's approval is not needed, and company can move forward with the advertising without any approval. North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it  is disapproved, that Company will be advised of the specific grounds for the disapproval. Company shall not use such disapproved  Advertising Materials until it has written approval from North.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces an inconsistency regarding the approval of advertising materials. The original clause states that the company cannot use North's Likeness or Endorsement unless the advertising materials are approved by North. The modified clause introduces an exception which states 'However, in certain situations, North's approval is not needed, and company can move forward with the advertising without any approval.', which introduces a contradiction. It's unclear what those situations are and it's in direct contradiction with the start of this paragraph.",

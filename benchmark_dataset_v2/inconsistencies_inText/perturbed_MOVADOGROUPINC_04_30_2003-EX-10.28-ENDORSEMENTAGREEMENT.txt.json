In the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with terms of Section 11, the Company shall not be liable for any premiums owed on the Policy after the date of termination.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding premium payments after termination. The original text states the Company is not liable for premiums after termination, while the modified text states the Company is liable for premiums up to 30 days after termination. This creates uncertainty regarding the extent of the Company's liability for premiums upon termination of the agreement.",

The Company may amend or modify this Agreement at any time, and any such amendment or modification shall be immediately effective, regardless of whether it adversely affects the rights of the Trust. The Company shall provide written notice to the Trust of any such amendments within 60 days of their enactment.",
                "explanation": "This creates a direct conflict regarding the amendment process. The original text requires the Trust's consent for amendments that adversely affect its rights, while the modified text allows the Company to unilaterally amend the agreement, regardless of the impact on the Trust's rights. The 60-day notice period does not mitigate the immediate impact of amendments that undermine the Trust's rights, which could lead to disputes over the enforceability of amendments.",

In the event of a \"Company Default\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Default by notifying the Company in writing within sixty (60) days after its receipt of notice of a Company Default, or if later, within thirty (30) days after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Default. If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within sixty (60) days after the Company Default occurs. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall immediately transfer ownership of the Policy to the Trust and the Company shall thereafter have no rights with respect to the Policy. The Trust's failure to exercise its rights under this Section 7 shall not be deemed to release the Company from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not preclude the Trust from seeking other remedies with respect to the Company Default. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"Company Default\" shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to the Policy if the Company fails to pay a premium on the Policy as required under the terms of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after the due date for such premium, or if the Company processes or attempts to process a policy loan, or a complete or partial surrender, or a cash value withdrawal without prior written approval from the Trustees of the Trust. The Company shall notify the Trustees of the Trust within five (5) business days of any event which constitutes a Company Default.",

                "explanation": "This change creates conflicting remedies for Company Default. Initially, the Trust has the right to policy transfer upon uncured default. However, the amended text removes this right and stipulates that failure to act releases the Company from obligations. This directly contradicts the previous provision and significantly alters the consequences of a Company Default, leading to uncertainty about which remedies are available and under what conditions.",

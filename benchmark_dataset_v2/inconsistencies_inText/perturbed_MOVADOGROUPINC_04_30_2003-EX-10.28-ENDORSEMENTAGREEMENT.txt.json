In the event of a \"Company Default\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Default by notifying the Company in writing within sixty (60) days after its receipt of notice of a Company Default, or if later, within thirty (30) days after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Default. If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within sixty (60) days after the Company Default occurs. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall immediately transfer ownership of the Policy to the Trust and the Company shall thereafter have no rights with respect to the Policy. The Trust's failure to exercise its rights under this Section 7 shall not be deemed to release the Company from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not preclude the Trust from seeking other remedies with respect to the Company Default. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"Company Default\" shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to the Policy if the Company fails to pay a premium on the Policy as required under the terms of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after the due date for such premium, or if the Company processes or attempts to process a policy loan, or a complete or partial surrender, or a cash value withdrawal without prior written approval from the Trustees of the Trust. The Company shall notify the Trustees of the Trust within five (5) business days of any event which constitutes a Company Default.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction by stating that the company has both 60 days and 30 days to cure a default. It also changes the notification period for a Company Default from five to ten business days, creating further uncertainty on the timelines to be followed. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes.",

Such decision shall set forth the reasons for denial in plain language. Pertinent provisions of the Agreement shall be cited and, where appropriate, an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided. This notice of denial of benefits will be provided within ninety (90) days of the Plan Administrator's receipt of the claim for benefits.

A claimant who has been completely or partially denied a benefit shall be entitled to appeal this denial of his or her claim by filing a written statement of his or her position with the Plan Administrator no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the written notification of such denial. The Plan Administrator shall schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal. The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for the decision, and shall cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based.

The Plan Administrator shall deliver the decision to the claimant in writing.

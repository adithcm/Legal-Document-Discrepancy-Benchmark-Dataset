If such period is greater than twenty (20) business days then this Sub-Reseller Agreement shall be deemed null and void and to be of no effect.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by changing the allowable time between signatures from ten (10) business days to twenty (20) business days before the agreement becomes null and void. This creates uncertainty as to which timeframe is valid.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that the sub-reseller is now a third-party beneficiary, which directly conflicts with the original statement that it is *not* a third-party beneficiary.

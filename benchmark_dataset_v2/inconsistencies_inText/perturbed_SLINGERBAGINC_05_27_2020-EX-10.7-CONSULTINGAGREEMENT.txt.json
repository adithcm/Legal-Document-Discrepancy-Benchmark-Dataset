                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the timing of monthly payments. The original text states payments are due within the first five days of the *following* month, whereas the modified text states payments are due within the last five days of the *current* month. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty regarding when payment is actually required, which could lead to disputes.",

                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction in the guarantee of a minimum bonus. The original contract explicitly sets a minimum of 25%, while the modified clause introduces a discretionary range from 0% to 25%, effectively removing the guaranteed minimum and creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

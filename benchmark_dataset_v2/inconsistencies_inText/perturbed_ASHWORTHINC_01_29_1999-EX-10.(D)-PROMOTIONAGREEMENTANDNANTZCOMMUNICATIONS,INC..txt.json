                "original_text": "10.  CONSULTING FEE.  The Company shall pay Nantz Communications an annual      consulting fee of $30,000, such fee to be paid in equal quarterly      installments of $7,500 on the 1st day of each June, September, December and      March of each Contract year.",

The Company shall pay Nantz Communications an annual      consulting fee of $30,000, such fee to be paid in equal quarterly      installments of $7,500 on the 1st day of each June, September, December and      March of each Contract year. Payments may be delayed up to 60 days without penalty.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding the payment terms. Section 10 originally stipulates specific payment dates (1st day of each quarter). The added sentence allows for a 60-day delay without penalty, which contradicts the original fixed payment schedule. This creates ambiguity about when payments are actually due and whether late fees should apply after the initial due date but before the 60-day grace period.",

The Company shall reimburse Nantz      Communications for expenses reasonably incurred by Nantz or Nantz      Communications in connection with the Services to the Company including,      but not limited to, first-class air fare, hotel accommodations, local      transportation and meals.

However, reimbursement for first-class air fare is capped at $500 per trip.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states the company will reimburse expenses including first-class air fare. The addition of a cap on first-class air fare reimbursement introduces a direct conflict. It's now unclear whether the company is obligated to fully reimburse first-class fare (as initially stated) or only up to $500, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This adds a contradiction to the termination clause. Initially, the clause specifies a cure period for failures to comply with the agreement. The added sentence removes the cure period for 'repeated minor infractions'. The contradiction creates uncertainty. What constitutes a 'minor infraction'? How many repetitions are required to remove the cure period? This ambiguity makes the termination rights unclear and potentially open to dispute.",

The total price for both of the Licensed Programs together is $[*] per month per Product (\"License Fee\"). The License Fee shall begin on the date the Product is shipped to a customer and shall be paid by Power2Ship to WLI by the 7th of each month for the prior month (prorated if the Unit was shipped during the prior month) and shall continue for as long as the Product is active on any wireless network. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Power2Ship is obligated to pay the License Fee to WLI for a minimum of 36 months.",

                "explanation": "This change creates an in-text contradiction by altering the payment deadline for monthly license fees.

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a conflict in termination terms. The original states that a failure to remedy a default within 15 days allows for termination, while the changed text extends this period to 30 days.

Affiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned. (2) Insofar as the referred end user accepts cookies when clicking on Affiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do arise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or possibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher via integrated link. (3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate. (4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user. The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be stipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the effective gross sales price of the software. (5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own discretion. (6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program. (7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or check, as chosen by the Affiliate. (8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces several inconsistencies. First, the payment frequency changes from monthly to quarterly, contradicting the original payment terms. Second, the minimum payment threshold is raised from 100 EUR/USD to 500 EUR/USD, creating confusion about when an affiliate will actually receive payment. Third, acceptable payment methods are restricted to wire transfer only, which contradicts the original options of wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only), or check. Fourth, the invoicing approval timeframe is shortened from four weeks to two weeks, potentially creating issues for affiliates who need more time to review invoices.",

This Agreement is entered into for an unlimited period of time. Either party may cancel this Agreement at any time, with or without supplying a reason, through written notification or by making suitable settings in the respective Control Panel.",
                "changed_text": "§ 7 Agreement period / Cancellation\n\nThe term of this Agreement will begin upon acceptance of Affiliate's Program application and will continue for a period of one (1) year, automatically renewing for successive one (1) year terms unless terminated as provided herein. Either party may cancel this Agreement only for cause, such as a material breach of the other party's obligations, through written notification delivered thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Termination without cause is only permitted during a 30-day window after each annual renewal date.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original agreement terms regarding the agreement period and cancellation. The original text states an unlimited agreement period with cancellation possible at any time, with or without reason. The modified text introduces a fixed one-year term with automatic renewal, and severely restricts cancellation options, requiring 'cause' or a 30-day window after renewal. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes regarding the length of the agreement and the conditions under which it can be terminated.",

(2) Upon termination of the relationship under this agreement, the Affiliate is obligated to undertake all of the technical measures necessary to delete from its Web site all links that refer to the Web sites of element 5 or to the Software Publisher. The same applies upon termination of Affiliate Management for links of the Software Publisher that were established in connection with the participation in Affiliate Management on its Web site.

                "explanation": "This change creates significant contradictions regarding payment upon termination. The original text states that fees earned up to the date of termination remain payable if the related orders are not canceled or returned, and that element 5 will retain final payment for a reasonable time (minimum 30 days). The modified text states that all Advertising Cost Compensation is forfeited immediately upon termination, contradicting the prior clause, and that element 5 can retain final payment indefinitely. Moreover, the modified text states that if the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it will not be offset or invoiced to Affiliate, thus directly contradicting the original text.",

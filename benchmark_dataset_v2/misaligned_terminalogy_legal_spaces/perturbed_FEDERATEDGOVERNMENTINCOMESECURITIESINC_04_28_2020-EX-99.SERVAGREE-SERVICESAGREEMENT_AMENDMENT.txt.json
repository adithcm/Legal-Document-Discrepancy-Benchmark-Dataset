                "explanation": "Several key phrases were modified to introduce ambiguity. 'Development of risk management programs' was changed to 'risk evaluation programs,' which is less specific. 'Compliance reports' became 'compliance communications,' reducing the obligation's clarity. 'Coordination of client portfolios' was downgraded to 'general support of client portfolios,' weakening FASC's responsibility.

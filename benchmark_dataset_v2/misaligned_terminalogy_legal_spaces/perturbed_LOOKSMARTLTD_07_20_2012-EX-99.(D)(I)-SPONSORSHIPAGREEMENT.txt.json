                "original_text": "Each Sponsor represents and warrants to each other Party that such Sponsor is bound by and has complied with,  and agrees that such Sponsor shall continue to be bound by and comply with, the Equity Commitment Letter and that each other Sponsor (other  than any Defaulting Sponsor) shall be entitled to enforce, or direct the enforcement of, such Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this  Agreement if and only if the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) have determined by unanimous written consent that the conditions of  the Offer have been satisfied or to waive all such conditions remaining unsatisfied.",
                "changed_text": "Each Sponsor represents and warrants to each other Party that such Sponsor intends to comply with the Equity Commitment Letter and that each other Sponsor (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) may attempt to enforce, or suggest the enforcement of, such Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this Agreement if and only if a majority of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor) have determined by a simple vote that the conditions of the Offer have been generally satisfied or to casually disregard any unsatisfied conditions.",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'is bound by and has complied with' with 'intends to comply with' which weakens the obligation and enforceability. Changed 'shall be entitled to enforce' to 'may attempt to enforce' which introduces uncertainty about the right to enforce. Changed 'unanimous written consent' to 'majority... simple vote' which alters the decision-making process, contradicting the original intent of unanimous agreement. Altered 'waive all such conditions remaining unsatisfied' to 'casually disregard any unsatisfied conditions'. This further weakens the enforcement of the conditions.",

                "original_text": "Each Sponsor that has complied with the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement  (\"Participating Sponsor\") may terminate the participation in the Offer of any Sponsor that has not satisfied the funding requirements contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise failed to comply with the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement (\"Defaulting  Sponsor\"); provided, however, that such termination shall not affect any right of any Participating Sponsor as against such Defaulting Sponsor  with respect to such failure to fund or any such other non-compliance.",
                "changed_text": "Each Sponsor that believes it has substantially complied with the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement (\"Potentially Participating Sponsor\") may consider terminating the participation in the Offer of any Sponsor that seems to have partially satisfied the funding requirements vaguely described by the Equity Commitment Letter or arguably failed to comply with some aspects of the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement (\"Arguably Defaulting Sponsor\"); provided, however, that such termination might affect some rights of any Potentially Participating Sponsor as against such Arguably Defaulting Sponsor with respect to such potential failure to fund or any such other possible non-compliance.",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'complied' with 'believes it has substantially complied', introducing subjectivity. 'Satisfied the funding requirements' changed to 'seems to have partially satisfied the funding requirements vaguely described by,' creating ambiguity. 'Defaulting Sponsor' replaced with 'Arguably Defaulting Sponsor' and 'Participating Sponsor' with 'Potentially Participating Sponsor' weakens the certainty of their status. 'Shall not affect any right' changed to 'might affect some rights', creating uncertainty about the consequences of termination.",

                "original_text": "To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Sponsor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other Sponsor  and any of its affiliates or any direct or indirect partner, member, shareholder, employee, director, officer or agent of such Sponsor or any of its  affiliates from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, judgments, awards, settlements, demands, offsets, and expenses  (including interest, penalties, court costs, arbitration costs and fees, witness fees and reasonable fees and expenses of outside attorneys,  investigators, expert witnesses, accountants and other professionals) arising out of or relating to any material breach or inaccuracy of the  representations, warranties or covenants of such Sponsor contained herein.",
                "changed_text": "To the extent deemed reasonable and practical, each Sponsor might consider indemnifying, possibly defending, and maybe holding harmless each other Sponsor and perhaps some of its affiliates from some of the losses, potential liabilities, alleged damages, possible claims, suggested judgments, questionable awards, tentative settlements, vague demands, possible offsets, and limited expenses (excluding most interest, penalties, court costs, arbitration costs and fees, witness fees and normally expenses of outside attorneys, investigators, expert witnesses, accountants and other professionals) vaguely arising out of or generally relating to any perceived breach or potential inaccuracy of the  representations, warranties or covenants of such Sponsor contained herein.",
                "explanation": "Weakened the obligation to indemnify by adding subjective qualifiers such as 'deemed reasonable and practical', 'might consider', and 'maybe holding harmless.' Limited the scope of indemnification by specifying 'some of the losses' and 'potential liabilities.' Excluded many typical expenses associated with indemnification, such as most interest and attorney's fees, creating ambiguity and reducing the value of the indemnification. Changed 'material breach or inaccuracy' to 'perceived breach or potential inaccuracy', making the standard for triggering indemnification more vague and subjective.",

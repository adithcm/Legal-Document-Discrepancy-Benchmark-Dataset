                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content\" shall mean, collectively, all materials, data, and similar information collected and owned by PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT, which is a collection of television shows, clips, movies, recordings and photos.",
                "changed_text": "\"PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content\" shall mean, collectively, some materials, data, and similar information selected by PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT, which may contain a few television shows, clips, movies, recordings and photos.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'all' to 'some' and 'collection' to 'a few,' the definition of PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content becomes ambiguous. This contradicts the initial grant of an exclusive license which assumes a comprehensive set of content. This ambiguity could undermine the enforceability of the exclusive license granted in the contract.",

                "original_text": "Revenue is described as all revenue generated from all content including broadcast and disk media, print and online properties. Net Revenue is the portion of revenue left after all costs associated with production, advertising, promotion and commissions which constitute the costs of sale.",
                "changed_text": "Revenue is loosely described as some revenue potentially generated from select content, potentially including broadcast and disk media. Net Revenue is arbitrarily determined after loosely accounting for a few costs.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the definition of Revenue and Net Revenue from concrete terms ('all revenue,' 'portion of revenue left after all costs') to vague terms ('some revenue potentially generated,' 'arbitrarily determined after loosely accounting for a few costs') creates ambiguity. This will make it difficult to enforce the revenue sharing provisions of the contract, as there is no clear standard for calculating the shared revenue.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies how notices must be sent - in writing to specified addresses. The modified version allows for oral/tacit communication delivered in any manner to any location, rendering the original written notice clause meaningless. This fundamentally alters the legal requirement of providing proper notice, which could affect termination or other critical rights and responsibilities under the contract.",

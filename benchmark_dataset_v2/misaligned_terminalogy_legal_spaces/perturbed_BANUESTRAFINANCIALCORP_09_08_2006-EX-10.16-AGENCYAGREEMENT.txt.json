                "original_text": "The Company and the Agent shall transmit all funds received from subscribers to the Escrow Agent by noon of the next business day following receipt thereof. The Company shall direct the Escrow Agent to make payment for Shares sold hereunder by wire transfer or certified or bank cashier's check drawn to the order of the Company in next day funds.",
                "changed_text": "The Company and the Agent shall transmit all funds received from subscribers to the Escrow Agent at their earliest convenience. The Company shall direct the Escrow Agent to make payment for Shares sold hereunder by wire transfer or company check drawn to the order of the Company in standard funds.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'noon of the next business day' to 'at their earliest convenience' and 'next day funds' to 'standard funds' introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard escrow practices, which require specific timelines for fund transfers to protect investors. Also, changing 'certified or bank cashier's check' to 'company check' directly goes against security expectations in financial transactions, increasing the risk of insufficient funds.",

                "original_text": "The fee shall be equal to 5.2% of the \"gross proceeds\" received in the Offering attributable to the efforts of the Agent. At least 48 hours prior to each Closing, the Agent shall deliver a schedule, identified as Appendix A, that lists each investor and the amount of investment.",
                "changed_text": "The fee shall be a 'reasonable commission' as determined by the Company. The Agent shall deliver a schedule, identified as Appendix A, that lists each potential investor and the estimated amount of investment 'when feasible'.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the clear percentage with \"reasonable commission\" and removing specific language like \"gross proceeds\" introduces significant ambiguity, as those phrases have no set legal meaning. The change to 'potential investor' weakens the contract and provides no specific requirements. This undermines the agent's compensation agreement and complicates enforcement.",

The Company has all such power, authority, authorizations, approvals and orders as may be required to enter into this Agreement, to carry out the provisions and conditions hereof and to issue and sell the Shares as contemplated herein and as described in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectuses, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus. The consummation of the Offering, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and this Agreement has been validly executed and delivered by the Company and is the valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent, if any, that the provisions of Section 10 hereof may be unenforceable as against public policy, and except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy laws, insolvency laws, or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.",

The Company believes it has adequate power to enter into this Agreement, and will attempt to carry out the provisions and conditions hereof and to issue and sell the Shares as generally contemplated herein. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement are thought to have been generally authorized, and this Agreement may be the valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company, potentially enforceable in accordance with some of its terms.",
                "explanation": "The language in section 3, a. was replaced with a less assertive tone. The original language creates obligations for the Company, which they may now walk back on if the language is not legally binding. This goes against the spirit of the contract.",

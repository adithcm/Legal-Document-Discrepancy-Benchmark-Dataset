Compensation (a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway agrees to pay Individual a royalty (the \"Royalty\") equal to $0.02 for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics; provided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual.

Compensation (a) In consideration of the rights granted by Individual hereunder, Lifeway agrees to potentially pay Individual a variable compensation (the \"Royalty\") based on Lifeway's discretion for each Lifeway product or individual item sold by Lifeway during each calendar month of the Term bearing Individual's first name, last name or other identifying personal characteristics; provided, however, the Royalty will cease being paid upon the death of Individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Royalty may or may not exceed $50,000 in any month.",
                "explanation": "Changing the definite \"Royalty equal to $0.02\" to a \"variable compensation based on Lifeway's discretion\" introduces ambiguity and contradicts the initial statement of a fixed royalty.

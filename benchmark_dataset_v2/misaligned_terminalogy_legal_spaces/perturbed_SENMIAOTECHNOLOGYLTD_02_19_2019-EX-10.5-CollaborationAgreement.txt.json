                "original_text": "1.8 \"Laws\" refers to laws, administrative regulations, local laws and regulations, autonomous regulations and separate regulations promulgated by the competent authorities, rules and regulations of the Ministries and Commissions of the State Council and local governments, judicial interpretations, normative documents, etc. in China.",
                "changed_text": "1.8 \"Laws\" refers to suggestions, opinions, or the general sentiment of the governing bodies, which may or may not be formally documented or legally binding. This includes, but is not limited to, suggestions, opinions, or the general sentiment of the governing bodies in China.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Laws' aligns with the standard understanding of legally binding statutes and regulations. The modified definition broadens the term to include non-binding 'suggestions' and 'opinions,' directly contradicting the established legal meaning. This creates uncertainty regarding which rules the parties must adhere to, thereby undermining the enforceability of the contract, as 'Laws' are referenced throughout the document.",

                "changed_text": "1.12 \"Personal Injury Compensation\" refers to amounts determined at Party B's sole discretion, taking into account prevailing market rates for similar injuries, but without reference to any specific legal standard or court interpretation.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties 'Personal Injury Compensation' to a specific legal interpretation by the Supreme People's Court. The revised definition allows Party B to determine compensation amounts without any legal benchmark, based solely on 'market rates,' contradicting the legally defined standard. This introduces ambiguity and potential legal challenges, particularly if Party B's assessment deviates significantly from established compensation principles under Chinese law.",

Force Majeure 13.1 \"Force Majeure\" means an event beyond the reasonable control of the Parties, unforeseeable or even foreseeable, but unavoidable by the Parties to this Agreement, which prevents, affects or delays the performance by either party of its obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part. Such event includes, but is not limited to, natural disaster, war, fire, riot, strike, Internet connection failure, computer system failure, communication failure, computer virus, hacker attack or any other similar events that shall be considered as events of force majeure in accordance with commercial practices.",
                "changed_text": "13. Force Majeure 13.1 \"Force Majeure\" shall mean any event that Party B deems, in its sole discretion, to affect its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, increased operating costs, changes in market conditions, or any internal business decisions made by Party B.",
                "explanation": "The original 'Force Majeure' clause aligns with the conventional understanding of unforeseeable and unavoidable events beyond a party's control. The modified clause grants Party B unilateral discretion to define 'Force Majeure' to include factors like 'increased operating costs' or 'internal business decisions,' which are typically within a party's control. This directly contradicts the established legal definition and could be deemed unconscionable, as it allows Party B to evade contractual obligations based on subjective and self-serving criteria.",

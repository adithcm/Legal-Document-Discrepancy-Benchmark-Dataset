                "explanation": "The term \"perpetual\" was replaced with “term-based”, creating a contradiction. Perpetual is meant to last forever, term-based is meant to last for a short time.

                "explanation": "The term “internal business purposes” was replaced with “external business purposes,” and “regardless of the Certegy Business.”, and “written agreements” was replaced with “oral agreements,”, and the “provide at a minimum” was replaced with “not provide a minimum”. This creates contradiction. A written agreement gives specifics to the term.

Such modifications shall not be effective until the Divested Business or the acquiror thereof, as required by Equifax, has entered into a license agreement with the appropriate member of the Equifax Group incorporating the terms of Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 and such other terms as Equifax reasonably deems appropriate for the protection of its interests in the Licensed Equifax Materials.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party A shall charge Party B energy saving service fee according to the income from CDQ waste heat power generation station.",
                "changed_text": "Party A shall charge Party B an operational cost recovery fee according to a rate unilaterally determined by Party A.",
                "explanation": "The term \"energy saving service fee\" has been replaced with \"operational cost recovery fee,\" and the determination method changed from income-based to unilateral determination. This creates uncertainty as it moves away from a clear contractual agreement on pricing, potentially contradicting fair pricing regulations if Party A's determination is unreasonable or not based on actual operational costs.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of contract law regarding fair dealing and good faith, and could run afoul of regulations prohibiting unfair or deceptive pricing practices depending on the jurisdiction.",

                "original_text": "The cooperation model is BO model. The expected total project cost is 176 million RMB. For the amount of electricity generated up to 800 million KWH after the project is put into operation, it shall be charged of the energy saving service fee at 0.40 RMB/KWH. After 800 million KWH, it shall be charged energy saving service fee with the rate of 0.20 RMB/KWH.",
                "changed_text": "The cooperation model is considered a general partnership. The initial estimate for the total project cost is 176 million RMB. Profit sharing will be determined at the sole discretion of Party A, based on its assessment of market conditions.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"BO model\" (Build-Operate) with \"general partnership\" significantly alters the legal relationship and financial arrangements, while also removing the specific energy saving service fee rates and replacing them with discretionary profit sharing. This conflicts with established contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms, particularly regarding compensation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract law principles concerning definiteness of terms and potentially partnership law regarding equitable profit distribution depending on jurisdiction.",

                "original_text": "After the termination of the contact, Party B has the disposition right to the project.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination of the contract, disposition rights will be determined at that time according to the prevailing market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The originally clearly defined \"disposition right\" of Party B is made contingent and uncertain by deferring the determination to \"prevailing market conditions\" at the time of termination. This introduces ambiguity and could create a dispute, conflicting with the intention of a clear property right outlined in the original agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates contract law principles requiring certainty of terms, especially concerning property rights and disposition, and could be unenforceable due to vagueness.",

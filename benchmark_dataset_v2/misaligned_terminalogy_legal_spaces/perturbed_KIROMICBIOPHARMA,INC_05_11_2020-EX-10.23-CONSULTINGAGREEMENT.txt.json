                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Consultant agrees to sign, execute and acknowledge or cause to be signed, executed and acknowledged without cost, but at the expense of Company, any and all documents and to perform such acts as my be necessary, useful or convenient for the purposes of perfecting the foregoing assignments and obtaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights in any and all countries with respect to Inventions. It is understood and agreed that Company or Company's designee shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain patent applications and patents worldwide with respect to Inventions.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant agrees to sign, execute, and acknowledge any documents necessary for intellectual property rights. It is understood that the Consultant has the primary right, but not the obligation, to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain patent applications and patents worldwide with respect to Inventions.",
                "explanation": "The modification shifts the responsibility and rights regarding patent applications from the company to the consultant. The original text clearly states that the Company has the sole right to file and maintain patents for Inventions. The modified version gives this right to the consultant, contradicting the initial agreement regarding intellectual property ownership and control.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way be construed to constitute Consultant as an agent, employee or representative of Company, but Consultant shall perform the Services as an independent contractor. Consultant acknowledges and agrees that Consultant is obligated to report as income all compensation received by Consultant pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to constitute Consultant as an agent of Company, Consultant shall perform the Services with company oversight. Consultant acknowledges and agrees that Company will withhold income taxes from all compensation received by Consultant pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By stating the consultant is acting as an agent of the company and company has oversight, the Consultant becomes an employee instead of an independent contractor. In addition, it is now company policy to take income taxes out, which is only done for employees, not for contractors. This is a contradiction of the original contract.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, including its conflicts of law principles.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specifies Texas law as the governing law. The modified version states that Delaware law will govern the contract and also includes conflict of law principles, creating potential uncertainty. This is contradictory and may affect the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement, especially if Delaware conflicts of law principles lead to the application of laws other than Delaware law.",

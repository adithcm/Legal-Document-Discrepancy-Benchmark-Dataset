                "original_text": "14.1 Approvals. Manufacturer shall be registered as the manufacturer of Manufacturer's Products and shall obtain such approvals from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and other regulatory bodies, public or private as may be required to manufacture and sell the products in the United States or internationally. Both Manufacturer and Subcontractor shall be responsible for complying with all federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and the like in the United States and in other countries as they may pertain to the Manufacturer's Products and to the obligations on the Parties to perform under this Agreement, including, without limitation, requirements in the United States with respect to registration of establishment, listing of medical devices, reporting of deaths, serious injuries and certain malfunctions under 21 CFR Medical Device Regulations and the potential therefore, tracking of medical devices, recalls, safety alerts and process controls.",
                "changed_text": "14.1 Approvals. Manufacturer shall be registered as the manufacturer of Manufacturer's Products and shall obtain preferred endorsements from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and other advisory bodies, public or private as may be helpful to market and sell the products in the United States or internationally. Only the Manufacturer shall be responsible for complying with its understanding of federal, state and local laws, rules, recommendations and the like in the United States and in other countries as they may pertain to the Manufacturer's Products and to the obligations on the Parties to perform under this Agreement, including, without limitation, optional participation in programs concerning registration of establishment, initial listing of medical devices, avoidance of reporting of deaths, minimal injuries and malfunctions under recommended 21 CFR Medical Device programs, voluntary tracking of medical devices, suggested recalls, courtesy alerts and basic process awareness.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'approvals' with 'preferred endorsements', the contract language now suggests compliance with the FDA is optional. Additionally, changing 'regulations' to 'recommendations' weakens the mandatory nature of compliance. Further, the change from 'reporting of deaths, serious injuries and certain malfunctions' to 'avoidance of reporting of deaths, minimal injuries and malfunctions' directly contradicts FDA requirements for mandatory reporting of adverse events, undermining the enforceability of regulatory standards.",

                "original_text": "5. Leased Space Agreement. Manufacturer will lease from Subcontractor a well-defined space for Manufacturer's Products within the Subcontractor's current FDA registered manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor is solely responsible for maintaining all aspects of such leased space including but not limited to; (i) segregation of Manufacturer's Products with all Manufacturer's Products clearly segregated and marked; and (ii) meeting all necessary requirements deemed appropriate by the FDA and any regulatory authorities for a medical device manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor will be also solely responsible for remaining in good standings at all times with all regulatory authorities including but not limited to the standards set forth by the FDA for medical device manufacturing facilities.",
                "changed_text": "5. Leased Space Agreement. Manufacturer will lease from Subcontractor a general space for Manufacturer's Products within the Subcontractor's current FDA contacted manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor is reasonably responsible for most aspects of such leased space including but not limited to; (i) optional grouping of Manufacturer's Products with Manufacturer's Products generally located together; and (ii) casually meeting many helpful suggestions deemed useful by the FDA and some advisory groups for a medical device manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor will be also somewhat responsible for maintaining some awareness occasionally with some advisory groups including possibly the standards mentioned by the FDA for medical device manufacturing facilities.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'well-defined space' to 'general space', and 'FDA registered' to 'FDA contacted' introduces vagueness. Replacing 'segregation' with 'optional grouping' and 'clearly segregated and marked' with 'generally located together' weakens the requirement for proper segregation, contradicting FDA guidelines. Changing 'necessary requirements deemed appropriate by the FDA' to 'many helpful suggestions deemed useful by the FDA' misrepresents FDA requirements as optional suggestions, and removing the requirement for 'remaining in good standings' allows for non-compliance.",

                "original_text": "7. Limited Warranty; Nonconforming Products. Since Manufacturer is paying the actual manufacturing cost of the product, Supplier has not reserved for any warranty related costs. The Manufacturer acknowledges that it is solely responsible for any warranty costs associated with Manufacturer's Products. Should any nonconformities be detected during or after the manufacturing process, Subcontractor will assist Manufacturer in resolving any quality issues with the suppliers.",
                "changed_text": "7. Limited Assurance; Possibly Imperfect Products. Since Manufacturer is estimating the approximate manufacturing cost of the product, Supplier has potentially reserved for some warranty related costs. The Manufacturer acknowledges that it may be partially accountable for some warranty costs associated with Manufacturer's Products. Should any unexpected deviations be perceived during or after the manufacturing process, Subcontractor might consider assisting Manufacturer in exploring possible quality discussions with the suppliers.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Limited Warranty' with 'Limited Assurance' and 'Nonconforming Products' with 'Possibly Imperfect Products' significantly weakens the guarantee. Changing 'actual manufacturing cost' to 'approximate manufacturing cost' introduces financial ambiguity and uncertainty. Further, the shift from 'is solely responsible' to 'may be partially accountable' dilutes the responsibility for warranty costs. And from 'Subcontractor will assist Manufacturer in resolving any quality issues' to 'Subcontractor might consider assisting Manufacturer in exploring possible quality discussions', diminishes the obligation to assist.",

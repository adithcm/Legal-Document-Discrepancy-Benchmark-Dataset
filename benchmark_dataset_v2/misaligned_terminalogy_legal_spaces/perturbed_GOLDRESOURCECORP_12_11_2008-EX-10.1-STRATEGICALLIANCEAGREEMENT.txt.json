                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(d) \"Affiliate\" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Securities Act;",
                "changed_text": "(d) \"Affiliate\" shall mean any entity controlled by HOC irrespective of the definition in the Securities Act;",
                "explanation": "The original definition references the Securities Act, providing a clear legal standard. The modified definition narrows the scope to entities controlled by HOC, deviating from the statutory definition and potentially causing confusion about which entities are considered affiliates under the agreement, which can affect provisions related to liability, information sharing, and other obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act definition of Affiliate",
                "location": "1.1(d)"

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(i) \"Business Day\" means any day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banks are generally closed for business in Denver, Colorado or London, England;",
                "changed_text": "(i) \"Business Day\" means any day the Company's offices are open in Denver, Colorado regardless of bank closures or weekends; ",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with standard legal practice by excluding weekends and bank holidays. The modified definition alters this to solely rely on whether the Company's offices are open, contradicting common legal and business understandings of 'Business Day'. This could lead to disputes regarding deadlines and obligations, especially if the Company chooses to remain open on days traditionally considered non-business days.",
                "contradicted_law": "General legal understanding of Business Day",
                "location": "1.1(i)"

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(j) \"Claims\" means all losses, damages, expenses, Liabilities, claims and demands of whatever nature or kind, including all reasonable legal fees and disbursements;",
                "changed_text": "(j) \"Claims\" means some losses, some damages, some expenses, some Liabilities, some claims and some demands, so long as they are less than $10,000.",
                "explanation": "The original definition is broad, encompassing all types of losses and expenses. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by specifying 'some' without clear criteria and imposing an arbitrary monetary limit. This contradicts the intent of a comprehensive claims definition, creating uncertainty about which claims are covered and leaving room for dispute over whether a particular loss qualifies under the definition.",

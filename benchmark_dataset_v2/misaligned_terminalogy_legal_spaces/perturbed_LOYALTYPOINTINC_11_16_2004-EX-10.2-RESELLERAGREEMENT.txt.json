Notwithstanding the foregoing, Schoolpop                   shall fund from AEIS a minimum of $52,000,000 of Cards (the                   \"Guaranteed Minimum\") in each Contract Year in order to                   maintain the exclusive right to sell Cards in the NPO                   Marketplace. A Contract Year shall be the period of August 1                   through July 31 of the succeeding year. In any Contract Year                   in which Schoolpop fails to fund the Guaranteed Minimum, AEIS                   shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) terminate                   the Agreement or (b) revoke the exclusivity.",

                "explanation": "The original contract defines a 'Contract Year' as a specific period (August 1 to July 31). The modification changes this definition to 'any period of time agreed upon verbally by both parties.' This introduces ambiguity because verbal agreements are difficult to prove and enforce, contradicting the original intention of a clearly defined term. It affects enforcement by making it uncertain when the 'Guaranteed Minimum' must be met.",

Schoolpop shall remain solely liable for any Loss                   caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of its                   employees, agents or representatives after the shipment has                   been received by Schoolpop.

                "explanation": "The original text specifies Schoolpop is responsible for the losses caused by negligence of its employees. The modified term makes Schoolpop liable for any Loss deemed \"reasonable by AEIS, regardless of fault\". This contradicts standard business practices where liability requires fault and creates uncertainty. The enforcement is uncertain because AEIS gets unilateral power to assign liability.",

It contradicts contract law principles requiring certainty in essential terms. Enforcement becomes uncertain as the actual limitation is subject to AEIS's whim.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Tallgrass Energy, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the guidelines established by the partnership, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of any filing convenient to such party under Section 13 or subsequent sections as deemed appropriate by the partners with respect to securities of Tallgrass Energy, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and further agree to the voluntary filing, if necessary, of this Agreement as an attachment thereto.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces legally defined terms like 'rules and regulations thereunder,' 'required,' and 'exhibit' with vague terms like 'guidelines,' 'convenient,' 'deemed appropriate,' and 'attachment'. This creates ambiguity and undermines the legally binding nature of the agreement under the Exchange Act.",

                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each party aims to assist with the filing, to the best of their capabilities, of such filings and any updates that are made, and will attempt to ensure that the information they provide is correct to their understanding; but none of them guarantees the completeness or accuracy of the data provided by others, even if there might be concerns regarding its validity.",
                "explanation": "This clause previously established clear responsibility for 'timely filing,' 'completeness,' and 'accuracy.' The modification replaces these with softer terms like 'aims to assist,' 'to the best of their capabilities,' and 'attempt,' significantly weakening the accountability and creating a contradiction in legal responsibility for accurate filings as required by the Exchange Act.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will continue unless a party feels it is not useful and informs the other parties of its intention to discontinue participation.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the agreement remains in effect until a formal written revocation is provided. By changing this to a more informal discontinuation process based on a party's subjective feeling of usefulness and informal notice, the modification introduces a contradiction. The 'full force and effect' language mandated by many legal documents is directly undermined.",

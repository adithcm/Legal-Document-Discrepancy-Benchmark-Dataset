(1) is based on any invention made at anytime , (2) (a) is owned by SONY or any of its Affiliates or (b) under which SONY or its Affiliates have the right to grant licenses, and (3) would, in the absence of a license granted herein, be infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or supplying any Competing Products (including, without limitation, the SRAM Products). \"Licensed Patents\" shall exclude the Transferred Patents.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition of \"Licensed Patent\" to encompass 'any intellectual property right' and removing the date restriction and specific patent characteristics, the scope is broadened beyond legally recognized patent definitions. It creates a contradiction because the agreement later refers specifically to patent rights.",

                "explanation": "By defining the transferred patents as comprising the data, the meaning clashes with patent law. This creates ambiguity in whether the transferred patents refer to the actual legal protections or just the data related to those patents.",

There are no Liens on any of the Transferred Patents.

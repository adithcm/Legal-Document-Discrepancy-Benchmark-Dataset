                "explanation": "The definitions of incident priorities have been altered to include subjective language that grants more discretion to Sicap Ltd in determining the severity and impact of incidents. This contradicts the intent of having clear, objective criteria for incident prioritization, potentially leading to disputes over response times and service levels. The original definitions had more definitive triggers for each priority level.",

                "explanation": "The definition of response time has been changed to be more vague and less committal. Replacing 'receipt' with 'acknowledgement', 'initiation of a solution' with 'attempted initiation of a potential solution' adds ambiguity, making it difficult to objectively measure whether Sicap Ltd is meeting its response time obligations. This creates uncertainty in enforcement of the response time guarantees.",

                "explanation": "The definition of working days/hours has been modified to introduce uncertainty by making it subject to Sicap Ltd's discretion and determination. The original definition provided a clear and fixed time frame. This change allows Sicap Ltd to unilaterally alter working hours and holiday exclusions, potentially reducing support availability without violating the contract on its face, but creating a legal contradiction against industry standards of fixed, predictable hours.",

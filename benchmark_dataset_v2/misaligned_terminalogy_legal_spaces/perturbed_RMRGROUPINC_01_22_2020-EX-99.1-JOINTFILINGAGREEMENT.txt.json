                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of us pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, with nominal value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of some of us in general compliance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "Changing '$0.001 par value' to 'with nominal value' introduces ambiguity. Under corporate law, 'par value' has a specific legal definition. 'Nominal value' is not a recognized legal term, creating uncertainty. Additionally, changing 'on behalf of each of us pursuant to and in accordance with' to 'on behalf of some of us in general compliance with' weakens the obligation to comply fully with Rule 13d-1(k), contradicting the rule's explicit requirements. This makes the filing potentially non-compliant and unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k)' with 'the spirit of Rule 13d-1(k) as understood' significantly weakens the legally binding nature of the agreement. 'Provisions' refers to the specific requirements of the law, whereas 'spirit' is subjective and open to interpretation. This contradicts the intent of the Securities Exchange Act to ensure clear and enforceable regulations.",

                "changed_text": "signed by the majority of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of those who signed",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that amendments must be signed by *each* party. Changing this to 'majority' undermines the requirement for unanimous agreement. This conflicts with standard contract law principles which enforce that all named parties in the original text agree and comply to the legal regulations.",

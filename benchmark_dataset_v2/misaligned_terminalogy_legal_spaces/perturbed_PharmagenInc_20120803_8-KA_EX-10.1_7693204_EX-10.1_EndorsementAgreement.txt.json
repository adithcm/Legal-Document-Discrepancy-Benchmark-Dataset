                "explanation": "Changing 'multivitamin' to 'similar health supplement' introduces ambiguity. While a multivitamin has a defined composition, a 'similar health supplement' lacks a clear legal or scientific definition. This could lead to disputes over what constitutes a competitive product, making the exclusivity clause difficult to enforce under contract law.",

                "changed_text": "HDS' products will be generally acceptable and usable, and",
                "explanation": "The original contract uses 'merchantable,' a term with a specific meaning under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), implying a warranty of quality. Replacing it with 'generally acceptable and usable' weakens this warranty and introduces ambiguity. 'Generally acceptable and usable' does not have a clear legal standard, potentially reducing HDS's liability for product defects and contradicting the implied warranty of merchantability.",

                "changed_text": "General Business coverage with product liability coverage as determined by HDS with limits to be mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the insurance clause from 'Commercial General Liability coverage' with specific limits to 'General Business coverage' with limits to be 'mutually agreed upon' creates uncertainty. Commercial General Liability has a standard definition and scope, whereas 'General Business coverage' is vague. Removing the fixed limits and making them subject to agreement allows HDS to potentially provide inadequate coverage, undermining the protection intended for the Celebrity and potentially violating standards for adequate product liability insurance.",

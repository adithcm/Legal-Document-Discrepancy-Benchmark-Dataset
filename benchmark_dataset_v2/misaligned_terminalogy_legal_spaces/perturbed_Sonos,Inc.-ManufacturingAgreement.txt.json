                "changed_text": "1.35. “Product” means items identified in detail in an applicable Statement of Work, attached hereto from time to time, to be manufactured by IAC for Sonos pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of “Product” specifically includes \"hardware, software, technology, and Components.\" By removing this explicit list and simply referring to \"items,\" the definition becomes ambiguous. This could lead to disputes over whether certain deliverables, particularly software or specific technology elements, are considered part of the “Product” subject to the manufacturing agreement.",

                "original_text": "1.42. “Quality Plan” means for any given Product the series of tests and inspections that must be performed by IAC during the manufacturing process to ensure that the Product meets the applicable Specifications. Each Product shall have a separate Quality Plan that is set forth in the applicable Statement of Work. While each Quality Plan shall be jointly developed and determined between and by Sonos and IAC, Sonos owns the Quality Plan and reserves the final decision-making regarding its contents.",
                "changed_text": "1.42. “Quality Plan” means for any given Product the series of tests and inspections that must be performed by IAC during the manufacturing process to ensure that the Product appears to meet the applicable Specifications. Each Product will have a Quality Plan. The Quality Plan shall be developed by both Sonos and IAC.",
                "explanation": "In the original text, it is clear that the Quality Plan 'must be performed' and that Sonos retains 'final decision-making authority of its contents.' By changing 'must be performed' to 'appears to meet,' the obligation is weakened. Additionally, by removing Sonos's ownership of the Quality Plan and ultimate say, it creates confusion about whose standards are applicable, creating potential for disputes over quality control.",

                "original_text": "10.2. Product Warranty by IAC. IAC hereby represents and warrants that for a period of [*] after the Manufacturing Date (the \"Warranty Period\"), a Product Unit will be free from defects in manufacturing process and defects in workmanship, will conform to general expectations of performance of wireless audio products and will conform to the Statement of Work for the applicable Product.

IAC hereby represents that for an undefined period, a Product Unit will be mostly free from defects in the current manufacturing process and defects in workmanship, and will mostly conform to the vague expectations of performance of wireless audio products and will somewhat conform to the Statement of Work for the applicable Product. For any Product Unit which is believed to be non-conforming, IAC might.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the product warranty provided by IAC. By changing the 'period' to 'undefined period', the 'will be free' to 'mostly free', and the 'will conform' to 'somewhat conform' create substantial ambiguity and reduces IAC's liability for defects. The new wording contradicts the implied guarantees of quality and performance that are standard in manufacturing agreements, potentially leading to disputes over what constitutes a warranty breach.",

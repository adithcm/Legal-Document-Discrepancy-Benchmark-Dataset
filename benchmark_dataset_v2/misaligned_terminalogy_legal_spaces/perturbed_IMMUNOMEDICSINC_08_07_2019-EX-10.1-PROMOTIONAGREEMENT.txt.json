When used as a verb, \"Detail\" means to deliver the presentation described in this definition. \"Detailing\" shall have a corresponding meaning.",

When used as a verb, \"Detail\" means to deliver a sales presentation. \"Detailing\" shall have a corresponding meaning.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the requirement for the sales representative to be 'adequately trained' and to present information 'in a fair and balanced manner consistent with' the Product Label, Promotion Rules and applicable Laws. It makes the parameters of describing the Product to one's own standards and removes legal obligation. This creates a contradiction as the sales representative is no longer legally bound to certain legal requirements when detailing.",

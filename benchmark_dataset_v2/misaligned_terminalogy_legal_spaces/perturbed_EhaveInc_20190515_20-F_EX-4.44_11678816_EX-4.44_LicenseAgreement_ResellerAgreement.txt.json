                "explanation": "By stating that 'Confidential Information includes all data and information, irrespective of its source or prior knowledge', the modified definition contradicts the standard legal understanding of confidentiality. Normally, information already in the public domain or rightfully possessed by the receiving party before disclosure is not considered confidential. This change creates uncertainty and potential unenforceability of the confidentiality clauses, as it deviates from established legal norms.",

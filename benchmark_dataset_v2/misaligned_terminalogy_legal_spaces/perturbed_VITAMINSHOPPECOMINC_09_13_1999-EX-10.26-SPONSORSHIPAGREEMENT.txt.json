                "original_text": "Client will be promoted as the preferred and dominant reseller of Vitamins in the Health Channel on the WebCrawler Site during the term of this Agreement. As such, Excite may not display banner advertising and/or promotional placements for any of Client's Competitors that are, in the aggregate, of equal or greater prominence and exposure than the aggregate of Client's links, advertising banners and promotional placements on the pages of the Health Channel on the WebCrawler Site during the term of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, Client's Competitors means those merchants identified in Exhibit D attached hereto. Client may update",

As such, Excite may not display banner advertising and/or promotional placements for any of Client's Other Vitamin Sellers that are, in the aggregate, of equal or greater prominence and exposure than the aggregate of Client's links, advertising banners and promotional placements on the pages of the Health Channel on the WebCrawler Site during the term of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, Client's Other Vitamin Sellers means those merchants identified in Exhibit D attached hereto. Client may update",
                "explanation": "Changing the term 'Competitors' to 'Other Vitamin Sellers' introduces ambiguity. The term 'competitors' has a defined business meaning, while 'Other Vitamin Sellers' is vague, making enforcement of exclusivity clauses more difficult. This introduces a perturbation by creating uncertainty about who is considered a competitor and what constitutes a violation of the agreement.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may display links to Excite's own products and services anywhere in the Excite Network, and may display links to Client's Competitors in results pages of search services in response to user queries, in general directories of Web sites, in classified advertising listings and in results in the \"Jango\" shopping search service throughout the Excite Network.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'Competitors' to 'Other Vitamin Sellers' again, the contract's clarity regarding exclusivity is undermined. A 'competitor' typically implies direct rivalry, while 'Other Vitamin Sellers' could include businesses that sell vitamins as a secondary offering. This ambiguity allows Excite more leeway in featuring other vitamin sellers, potentially diminishing the value of Client's preferred status.",

                "explanation": "Changing the word 'target' to 'contact' creates a contradiction to user data laws. While targeting is related to the use of data for advertisement purposes, 'contact' is broader. This undermines user data protection by suggesting a broader permission than legally allowed, potentially exposing user information without clear constraints.",

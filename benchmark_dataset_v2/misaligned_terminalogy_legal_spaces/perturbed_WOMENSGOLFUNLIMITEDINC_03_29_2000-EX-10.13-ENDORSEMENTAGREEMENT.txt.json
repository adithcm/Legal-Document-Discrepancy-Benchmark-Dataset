                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "WHEREAS, the Company and the Professional desire to enter into an agreement pursuant to which the Professional will serve the Company as an independent contractor, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Company and the Professional desire to enter into an agreement pursuant to which the Professional will serve the Company as an employee, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.",
                "explanation": "This change misaligns the term 'independent contractor' with its intended statutory meaning. While the contract later defines the relationship as 'independent contractor,' stating initially that the professional will serve as an 'employee' creates a contradiction and uncertainty about the true nature of the working relationship.",

                "explanation": "This directly contradicts the intended independent contractor status by stating the Professional is an 'employee.' This conflicts with IRS and state guidelines, potentially causing misclassification issues. While the text aims to define the 'Professional' as an 'independent contractor', the modification explicitly states 'employee'.",

                "original_text": "6.3 The Professional will be solely responsible for withholding and paying any and all federal, state and local taxes, including but not limited to payroll, unemployment, social security and income taxes, and any other payments which may be due as a result of or in connection with payments made by the Company for services rendered under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "6.3 The Professional will not be responsible for withholding and paying any and all federal, state and local taxes, including but not limited to payroll, unemployment, social security and income taxes, and any other payments which may be due as a result of or in connection with payments made by the Company for services rendered under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This clause now states that the 'Professional' is NOT responsible for tax withholdings, contradicting standard practices for independent contractors, and aligning more with employee status. This introduces legal ambiguity, as independent contractors are legally obligated to handle their own tax payments, while it is an employer's duty to withhold taxes for their employees.",

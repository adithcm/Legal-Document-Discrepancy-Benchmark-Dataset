                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Additional Work shall be defined as the addition or revision of pages, graphics, or other features, any text, graphic or page design or programming requiring more than two rounds of textual or graphical revisions, substantial revisions to text and/or content provided by Client, changes to elements which have been finalized, or significant changes in the Scope of Work.",
                "changed_text": "Additional Work shall be defined as minor tweaks to existing pages, simple graphic alterations, or superficial text changes. Any modifications beyond these shall be considered part of the original scope of work and not subject to additional charges.",
                "explanation": "This contradicts the standard definition of 'Additional Work' by drastically narrowing its scope. Traditionally, 'additional work' encompasses a broader range of changes. By limiting it to 'minor tweaks' and stating anything beyond is part of the original scope, the contract becomes ambiguous and potentially unenforceable regarding payment for substantial changes, conflicting with standard business practices and potentially applicable consumer protection laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates consumer protection laws related to fair business practices and transparency in contracts; conflicts with generally accepted understanding of 'scope of work' in service agreements.",

                "changed_text": "Client hereby grants to Company an exclusive and unlimited license to use Client's trade names, logos and other trademarks in connection with Company advertising, marketing and promotion of its products and services.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'non-exclusive and limited' to 'exclusive and unlimited', the contract now allows the company to use the client's trademarks without any restrictions, potentially preventing the client from using their own trademarks for their own purposes. This creates a significant legal issue, especially if the client later wants to use their trademarks in ways that compete with the company's activities. This contradicts fundamental principles of trademark law, which allows trademark owners to control how their marks are used.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark Law (Lanham Act in the US) regarding ownership and control of trademarks.",

                "changed_text": "Company representatives are available during unspecified hours, Monday through Friday. The processing of emails and telephone communications is determined solely at the discretion of the Company.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific business hours and stating that processing communications is at the company's discretion, this makes the availability and response times of the company vague. This creates ambiguity in the company's obligations for customer service, and thus there is no way for the client to ensure support for the website. This contradicts the concept of 'reasonable service' implied in service agreements.",

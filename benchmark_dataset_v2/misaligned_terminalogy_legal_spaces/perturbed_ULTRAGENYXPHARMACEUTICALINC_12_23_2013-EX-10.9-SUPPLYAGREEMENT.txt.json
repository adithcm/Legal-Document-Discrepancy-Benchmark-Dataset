                "original_text": "1) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement Cremer shall supply Ultragenyx with the Product free from defect and meeting the product specification attached to this Agreement as Annex A (the \"Product Specifications\").",
                "changed_text": "1) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement Cremer shall supply Ultragenyx with the Product reasonably free from defect, adhering in general terms to the product specification attached to this Agreement as Annex A (the \"Product Specifications\").",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'free from defect' and 'meeting the product specification', which are stringent requirements. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'reasonably free from defect' and 'adhering in general terms'. This contradicts the original intention of precise adherence to specifications, potentially leading to disputes over the acceptable quality of the Product. Under German law, specifically the German Civil Code (BGB), the standard for product quality is clearly defined, and this change weakens that standard.",

                "changed_text": "3) Cremer believes that all quantities of Product delivered under the Agreement were manufactured generally in accordance with GMP guidelines. The Product shall be considered acceptable if it roughly aligns with the specifications according to Annex A.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a firm warranty that the Product is manufactured according to GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards and free from defects if within the specifications. The modified text weakens this warranty to a 'belief' of general compliance with GMP guidelines and 'rough alignment' with specifications. This introduces ambiguity and reduces Cremer's liability, conflicting with the strict liability standards often associated with pharmaceutical products under German law.",

                "original_text": "9) Cremer's liability arising from this Agreement is limited to intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This limitation of liability does not apply to the injury of the life, body or health of a person, to claims according to the Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz) or any other coercive legal liability claims.",
                "changed_text": "9) Cremer's liability arising from this Agreement is limited to cases of proven willful misconduct. This limitation of liability also applies to claims related to personal injury, except in cases of direct and intentional harm demonstrably caused by Cremer, and to claims under the Produkthaftungsgesetz only when Cremer had direct knowledge of the defect.",
                "explanation": "The original text correctly carves out exceptions to the limitation of liability, including injury to life, body, or health and claims under the Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz). The modified text attempts to narrow these exceptions. Specifically, it adds conditions like 'direct and intentional harm' and 'direct knowledge of the defect,' making it harder for Ultragenyx to claim damages for personal injury or product liability. This contradicts the strict liability principles underlying the Produkthaftungsgesetz and general principles of tort law under the German Civil Code.",

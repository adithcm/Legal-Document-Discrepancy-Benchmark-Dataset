                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the specified Person. As used in this definition, \"control\", \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\" means possession, directly or indirectly, of power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies of such Person (whether through ownership of securities or other partnership or ownership interests, as trustee, personal representative or executive or by contract, credit agreement or otherwise), provided that in any event, any Person which owns directly, indirectly or beneficially 50% or more of the securities having voting power for the election of directors or other governing body of a corporation or 50% or more of the partnership interests or other ownership interests of any other Person will be deemed to control such Person.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the specified Person. As used in this definition, \"control\", \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\" means influence, directly or indirectly, of power to suggest the direction of management or policies of such Person (whether through ownership of securities or other partnership or ownership interests, as trustee, personal representative or executive or by contract, credit agreement or otherwise), provided that in any event, any Person which owns directly, indirectly or beneficially 25% or more of the securities having voting power for the election of directors or other governing body of a corporation or 25% or more of the partnership interests or other ownership interests of any other Person will be deemed to control such Person.",
                "explanation": "The term \"control\" and the percentage threshold for defining an affiliate have been altered. Typically, \"control\" implies a definitive power, and a 50% ownership is a common benchmark for affiliate status. Changing \"power to direct\" to \"power to suggest\" and lowering the ownership threshold to 25% introduce ambiguity, particularly under corporate and securities laws where 'control' has specific legal implications. This creates uncertainty about which entities fall under the definition of “Affiliate”, especially in scenarios involving fiduciary duties or conflict of interest disclosures.",

                "changed_text": "\"Law\" means all suggested practices, recommendations, company guidelines, decrees, judgments, codes, standards, acts, orders, by-laws, rules, regulations, permits, voluntary policies and guidelines and internal requirements of all Governmental Authorities.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces legally binding terms like 'laws' and 'statutes' with terms such as 'suggested practices' and 'voluntary policies'. This directly contradicts the standard legal meaning, making it unclear which mandates the parties must adhere to. This change creates ambiguity and undermines the enforceability of the contract, as it is uncertain if compliance with actual legal requirements is expected.",

                "changed_text": "Philips represents and warrants to Customer that all Products delivered and any services provided hereunder: i. substantially conform to the Specifications on the Delivery Date [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive]; ii. unless otherwise agreed with Customer in writing, are new (do not contain any used or reconditioned parts or materials) and generally suitable for the purposes for which they are intended; iii. are of acceptable workmanship, reasonable quality and mostly free from critical defects in construction, manufacture and material [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive]; iv. the manufacturing and shipment of the Product aim to comply in most respects with applicable Laws, regulations, certification requirements, including health and safety standards and all other applicable regulatory requirements for the manufacture and shipment of Products; v. are reasonably free and clear of all known liens, encumbrances, and other Claims against title; and vii. substantially comply in most respects with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Purchase Orders.",
                "explanation": "The language of Philips' warranties has been weakened by replacing strict terms with more lenient ones. \"Conform\" becomes \"substantially conform\", \"fit\" becomes \"generally suitable\", \"good quality\" becomes \"reasonable quality\", \"free from defects\" becomes \"mostly free from critical defects\", and \"comply in all respects\" becomes \"aim to comply in most respects.\" This significantly dilutes the warranty protection offered to the Customer, making it harder to hold Philips accountable for failing to meet specific quality and regulatory standards. Under commercial law, a clear and unambiguous warranty is essential for determining liability, and these changes introduce significant uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "Credit Data. The term \"Credit Data\" means data of any borrower or loan applicant of Client or BNC Mortgage, Inc., or any of their affiliates, or any of their customers or brokers, provided that such data (i) consists only of raw credit data regarding the creditworthiness of such a borrower or loan applicant provided by third party credit repositories which currently consists of TransUnion Credit Information Services, Equifax Credit Information Services or Experien Information Services that is submitted, transmitted or in any way sent through the Interface and is the later of (I) the later of 31 days old from that date of receipt thereof by TrueLink or that date on which such data is \"archived\" pursuant to TrueLink's internal operating procedures consistently applied or (II) such date as may be agreed to between Client and Keith Guy provided that the parties acknowledge that such parties will discuss a date on which such data is similarly \"archived\" third party credit repositories as referred in this subparagraph (d) and (ii) is not combined, compared with or against, integrated or presented in any way with any Client Proprietary Information.",
                "changed_text": "Credit Data. The term \"Credit Data\" means any information related to a borrower or loan applicant, including but not limited to, credit scores, financial history, and personal details, regardless of the source or age of the information. This encompasses all data, irrespective of whether it is raw, processed, or combined with Client Proprietary Information.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Credit Data' was tightly constrained to raw data from specific credit repositories, excluding combined or aged data. The modified definition broadens the scope to include any information about a borrower, regardless of source or processing. This contradicts the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which sets specific rules for the use and handling of credit data from credit reporting agencies. By removing these constraints, the contract potentially allows for uses of credit information that violate FCRA regulations, like using non-validated data or combining it with proprietary information without proper disclosures.",

                "changed_text": "Client will endeavor to comply with consumer credit reporting, privacy, and similar laws, but compliance is not guaranteed due to the dynamic nature of these regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates full compliance with consumer credit reporting and privacy laws. The modified clause weakens this obligation by stating that compliance is not guaranteed. This directly contradicts the legal requirements imposed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and other consumer protection laws, which demand strict adherence. By introducing uncertainty, the modified text creates ambiguity regarding the client's legal responsibilities, potentially shielding them from liability in cases of non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "TrueLink may offer the Systems without authorization from System providers at its sole discretion. The parties agree that this arrangement implicitly creates a partnership for maximizing profit.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that TrueLink requires authorization to offer the systems, and denies any partnership. The changed text contradicts the first statement by allowing TrueLink to offer systems without authorization, a potential violation of licensing agreements and intellectual property law. Furthermore, the second statement explicitly establishes a partnership despite the denial of any partnership. This contradiction makes the responsibilities of the parties unclear and can make the agreement unenforceable.",

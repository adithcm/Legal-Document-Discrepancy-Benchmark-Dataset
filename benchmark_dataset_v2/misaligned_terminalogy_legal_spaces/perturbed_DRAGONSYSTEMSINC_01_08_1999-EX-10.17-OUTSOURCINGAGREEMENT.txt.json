            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "MMI warrants providing the Services with due diligence and care in accordance\n\n\n\nwith the specifications set by Dragon Systems. Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 6 months from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims.",
                "changed_text": "MMI ensures the Services will be delivered with reasonable effort and attention, adhering to Dragon Systems' outlined specifications. If MMI fails to provide the Services as stipulated, or if the Services exhibit flaws within 6 months of delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may, at its discretion, request MMI to remedy or redo the Services within a timeframe deemed appropriate, terminate the agreement, or withhold a portion or the entirety of the compensation, irrespective of any claims for damages.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses the term 'warrants providing the Services with due diligence and care,' which implies a legal standard of professional conduct. The modified text replaces this with 'ensures the Services will be delivered with reasonable effort and attention,' weakening the commitment to a standard of due diligence. This creates ambiguity about the level of care required, contradicting established legal expectations for service contracts.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring 'due diligence' in service contracts; potential breach of implied warranty.",
                "location": "Section 6"

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "MMI shall reimburse Dragon Systems and hold Dragon Systems harmless from any liabilities or obligations imposed upon Dragon Systems resulting directly or indirectly from MMI's or its employees or agents activities under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "MMI will consider compensating Dragon Systems for certain liabilities or obligations arising from MMI's or its employees or agents actions under this Agreement, subject to MMI's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear indemnity obligation. The modified text changes 'shall reimburse and hold harmless' to 'will consider compensating,' making the indemnity discretionary. This directly contradicts the legal expectation of a clear and enforceable indemnity clause, creating uncertainty and limiting Dragon Systems' protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard legal principles governing indemnity clauses in contracts.",
                "location": "Section 7"

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party shall be liable for failure or delay in performance of its duties under this Agreement except for reasons beyond such party's reasonable control. MMI shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damages unless caused by intention or gross negligence.",
                "changed_text": "Neither party will be held responsible for any failure or delay in fulfilling their obligations under this Agreement for any reason. MMI's liability for any type of damages is completely waived.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a standard of liability with a specific exception for events beyond reasonable control and limits liability for indirect damages only in cases of intention or gross negligence. The modified text eliminates liability for both parties entirely, regardless of the cause and removes gross negligence considerations, contradicting fundamental principles of contract law regarding liability for breach of contract and introducing an exculpatory clause of highly questionable validity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic principles of contract law related to liability for breach of contract and enforceability of exculpatory clauses; standard of reasonable care.",

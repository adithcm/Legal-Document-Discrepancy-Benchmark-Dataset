                "original_text": "1.5 The term \"Products\" shall mean those certain products, specified by brand name, manufactured and marketed under the Trademarks by STAAR that are listed on Exhibit A-1 hereto. STAAR may from time to time modify or change the Products on Exhibit A-1 in its sole discretion, and if so, will notify Distributor promptly thereof. In the event that STAAR discontinues a Product, it will provide at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Distributor. Distributor shall not modify, disassemble or reverse engineer any Product, in whole or in part.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 The term \"Products\" shall mean any items STAAR chooses to supply, regardless of whether they are listed on Exhibit A-1. STAAR may modify or change the Products without notice to the Distributor. In the event that STAAR discontinues a Product, no prior notice is required. Distributor may modify, disassemble or reverse engineer any Product, in whole or in part.",
                "explanation": "By stating that 'Products' are any items STAAR chooses to supply, and can be changed or modified without notice, directly contradicts the initial agreement that defined 'Products' as those listed in Exhibit A-1. This removes the distributor's right to prepare for changes in product offerings and gives STAAR total unilateral control. This change contradicts contract law principles of mutual agreement and fair dealing, creating uncertainty and enforceability issues.",

                "original_text": "9.1 STAAR warrants that, for the period of twelve (12) months from the date of delivery to Distributor hereunder (the \"Warranty Period\"), the Products will meet STAAR's published specifications or labeling for such Products as in effect at the time of such delivery (\"Warranty\"). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise stated in this Agreement: (a) the foregoing Warranty is exclusive; and (b) all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded, whether express or implied (including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or against infringement).",
                "changed_text": "9.1 STAAR offers no guarantees regarding the Products, either expressed or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise stated in this Agreement: (a) STAAR provides no warranty whatsoever; and (b) all terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded, whether express or implied (including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or against infringement).",
                "explanation": "By explicitly stating that STAAR offers 'no guarantees' and 'no warranty whatsoever,' this change fundamentally contradicts the initial warranty provided. This alteration directly undermines standard commercial practice and consumer protection laws that imply certain warranties (e.g., merchantability). This creates a legal contradiction that makes the enforceability of any implied warranty ambiguous.",

The parties hereby expressly disclaim and exclude any applicable provisions of the United Nations Convention for the International Sales of Goods.",
                "changed_text": "25.1 This Agreement, which is in English, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with principles of fairness as determined by STAAR, without regard to any specific jurisdiction or legal precedent. All laws are expressly disclaimed.",
                "explanation": "This replaces a clearly defined governing law (California law) with the vague term 'principles of fairness as determined by STAAR'. This removes any objective legal standard and gives STAAR complete discretion in interpreting and enforcing the contract. This contradicts basic principles of contract law, which require a defined legal framework, leading to unenforceability due to lack of legal certainty.",

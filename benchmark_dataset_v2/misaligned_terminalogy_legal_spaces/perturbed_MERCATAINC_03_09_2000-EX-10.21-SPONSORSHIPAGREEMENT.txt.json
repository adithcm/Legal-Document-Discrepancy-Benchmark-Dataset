                "original_text": "3. Consideration.  In consideration of the sponsorship rights and other services    -------------    and products granted and provided to Sponsor by FNW hereunder, Sponsor hereby    agrees to pay FNW a sponsorship fee in the amount of Forty thousand Dollars    ($40,000 net) (the \"Sponsorship Fee\").",

In consideration of the sponsorship rights and other services and products granted and provided to Sponsor by FNW hereunder, Sponsor hereby agrees to pay FNW a sponsorship donation in the amount of Forty thousand Dollars ($40,000 net) (the \"Sponsorship Fee\").",
                "explanation": "The term 'fee' implies a payment for services rendered with a direct benefit to the payer. Changing it to 'donation' introduces ambiguity, as donations are typically gratuitous and may not create a binding contractual obligation under Washington State contract law regarding consideration. This could lead to disputes over the enforceability of the payment obligation.",

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this     -----------     Agreement, including, but not limited to a claim based on or arising from an     alleged tort will, at the request of any party be determined by arbitration     in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq.)     under the auspices and rules of the American Arbitration Association     (\"AAA\").",

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to a claim based on or arising from an alleged disagreement will, at the request of any party be determined by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq.) under the auspices and rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\").",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'tort' with 'disagreement' significantly narrows the scope of arbitrable disputes. 'Tort' has a specific legal meaning, while 'disagreement' is vague and undefined. This change could be interpreted as excluding legally cognizable claims (like negligence or fraud) from arbitration, potentially conflicting with the broad scope intended by the Federal Arbitration Act.",

Nothing herein contained shall create or be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties and no party shall have the authority to bind the other in any respect.",
                "explanation": "Replacing “independent contractors and independent employers” with “vendors” creates ambiguity about the true nature of the relationship. While independent contractors have specific legal definitions and obligations, the term “vendor” is much broader and lacks a precise legal definition. This change introduces uncertainty about the legal responsibilities and liabilities of each party, especially regarding tax implications and potential liability for each other’s actions.",

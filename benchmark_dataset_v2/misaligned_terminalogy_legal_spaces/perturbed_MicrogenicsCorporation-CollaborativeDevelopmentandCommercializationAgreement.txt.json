                "changed_text": "1.7 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" shall mean efforts and resources a Party deems appropriate for a product it owns or has rights to, considering the competitiveness of the marketplace, the productâ€™s proprietary position, regulatory structure, and profitability. It does not require specific actions or a minimum level of effort.",
                "explanation": "The original definition includes specific factors and implies a standard level of diligence. The modified definition is vague and discretionary, allowing a party to determine effort levels without regard to industry standards or regulatory expectations. This introduces a contradiction regarding the enforceability of obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original definition covers all proprietary information whether explicitly marked or not. The modified definition requires explicit marking, conflicting with standard trade secret law, which protects inherently confidential information even without marking. This creates ambiguity regarding the protection of unmarked proprietary data.",

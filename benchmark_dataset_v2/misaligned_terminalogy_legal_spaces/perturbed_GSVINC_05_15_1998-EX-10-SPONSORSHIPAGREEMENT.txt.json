                "original_text": "Excite will in \"good faith\" ensure Client that the above mentioned             banners and promotional placements will be more prominently             presented than any other \"competitive retailer's\" banners or             promotional placements for the term of the Agreement. For the             purposes of this Agreement, a \"competitive retailer\" means an             on-line department store comparable to Bloomingdale's, Macy's,             Burdine's, Shopping.com, Chef's Catalog or iQVC.",
                "changed_text": "Excite will use 'best efforts' to ensure Client that the above mentioned banners and promotional placements will be more prominently presented than any other \"competitive retailer's\" banners or promotional placements for the term of the Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"competitive retailer\" means an on-line department store which Excite, in its sole discretion, deems competitive.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'good faith' with 'best efforts' and redefining \"competitive retailer\" introduces ambiguity. 'Good faith' has a legal definition, implying honesty and reasonableness. 'Best efforts' is vaguer and depends heavily on context. Additionally, the change grants Excite sole discretion in determining what constitutes a 'competitive retailer,' potentially undermining the purpose of the exclusivity clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law regarding clear and unambiguous terms; potential violation of antitrust laws if 'competitive retailer' is defined to exclude genuine competitors.",

                "changed_text": "User Data will be considered the shared asset of both parties, and both parties will retain rights to use this data. However, Excite maintains the right to control and dictate how user data can be used.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies equal rights to User Data. The modified text, while stating shared asset, gives Excite the right to 'control and dictate how user data can be used,' essentially negating the 'joint property' aspect. This introduces a contradiction, as joint property implies equal rights, but the added clause creates unequal power in data usage. State Data protection laws prioritize user data protection. Therefore, Excite limiting user rights over their data constitutes a breach of these rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state data privacy laws, specifically those relating to consumer data rights.",

Once per year, the parties will review these records to             verify the accuracy and appropriate accounting of all payments made             pursuant to the Agreement. In addition, Excite may, upon no less             than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Client, cause an             independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of             Client reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during             Client's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified             Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by             Excite unless the payments made to Excite are determined to have             been less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the payments actually             owed to Excite, in which case Client will be responsible for the             payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.",
                "changed_text": "Client will maintain records regarding the estimation of all revenue payments due under this agreement. In addition, Excite may, at any time, inspect these records. All fees charged by the CPA will be paid by the client.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'accurate records' and outlines a process for independent verification, placing the cost on Excite unless a significant discrepancy is found. The modified text weakens the 'accurate records' to 'estimation of,' allows Excite to inspect the records 'at any time' (removing the 30-day notice), and shifts the cost of the inspection to the Client regardless of the findings. 'Accurate records' have an implied legal obligation of precision. This obligation has been diminished by inaccurate estimation. Also, limiting the legal rights of reasonable notice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract law regarding reasonable access and inspection rights; potential issues with auditing standards if 'estimation' is used instead of accurate accounting.",

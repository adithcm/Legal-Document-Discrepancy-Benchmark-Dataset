                "original_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Party, any entity directly or indirectly controlled by, controlling or under common control with such Party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (a) ownership of fifty percent (50%) (or such lesser percentage which is the maximum allowed to be owned by a foreign entity or investor in a particular jurisdiction) or more of the outstanding voting stock or other ownership interest of an entity, or (b) possession of the power to (i) elect, appoint, direct or remove fifty percent (50%) or more of the members of the board of directors or other governing body of an entity or (ii) otherwise direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of an entity by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Party, any entity the Party finds favorable. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (a) ownership of twenty percent (20%) (or such lesser percentage which is the minimum allowed to be owned by a foreign entity or investor in a particular jurisdiction) or more of the outstanding voting stock or other ownership interest of an entity, or (b) influence through any means necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' relies on standard ownership and control criteria, primarily focusing on majority ownership or the power to direct management. The modified definition introduces ambiguity. Describing an affiliate as an entity the 'Party finds favorable' lacks legal precision. Furthermore, changing the control definition to include 'influence through any means necessary' is overly broad and could encompass actions not typically considered control under corporate law, creating uncertainty and potential legal disputes.",

Confidential Information will not, however, include any information that: (a) was publicly known or generally available to the public prior to the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient; (b) becomes publicly known or generally available to the public after disclosure by Discloser to Recipient through no wrongful action or inaction of Recipient; (c) is in the rightful possession of Recipient without confidentiality obligations at the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient as shown by Recipient's then-contemporaneous written files and records kept in the ordinary course of business; (d) is obtained by Recipient from a third party without an accompanying duty of confidentiality and without (to Recipient's knowledge) a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; or (e) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloser's Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Definition. \"Confidential Information\" means any information one Party wishes to keep secret. Confidential Information will not, however, include any information that: (a) was known by someone; (b) becomes known by someone after disclosure by Discloser to Recipient through no action of Recipient; (c) is in the possession of Recipient; (d) is obtained by Recipient from someone without an accompanying duty of confidentiality; or (e) is developed by Recipient.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' provides specific and reasonable exceptions based on public knowledge, prior possession, third-party sources, and independent development. The modified definition introduces contradiction by severely weakening the exceptions. The new exceptions are vague and overly broad, lacking requirements for 'publicly known', 'rightful possession', or restrictions on how information was obtained, potentially nullifying the confidentiality obligation.",

This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of laws provisions of any jurisdiction. The Parties agree that the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "9.4 Governing Law. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder will be governed by whatever laws the parties want at the time, or if they cannot agree, by common sense. The Parties agree that international law will apply to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Delaware law as governing, providing legal certainty. The revised version replaces this with 'whatever laws the parties want at the time' or 'common sense,' and makes international law apply, creating direct conflict. 'Whatever laws the parties want' is unenforceable. 'Common sense' is not a recognized legal standard. This ambiguity completely undermines the purpose of a governing law clause, making dispute resolution unpredictable and unenforceable. Since the contract is between a United States company and a German company, making international law apply creates a massive conflict of laws problem.",

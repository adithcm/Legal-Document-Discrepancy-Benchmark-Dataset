                "original_text": "1.27 \"Improvement\" means any Patent, invention or other intellectual property made or used by or under authority of Ono (including any Ono Know-How) in connection with Development, Manufacture and/or Commercialization of Binimetinib, Encorafenib and/or a Product, in each case, to the extent the same is owned or Controlled by Ono or any of its Affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "1.27 \"Improvement\" means any discovery, process enhancement or novel technique made or used by or under authority of Ono (including any Ono Know-How) in connection with Development, Manufacture and/or Commercialization of Binimetinib, Encorafenib and/or a Product, in each case, to the extent the same is owned or claimed by Ono or any of its Affiliates.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Patent, invention or other intellectual property' to 'discovery, process enhancement or novel technique' creates a misaligned terminology. 'Improvement', 'owned' and 'Controlled' have specific legal meanings in the context of intellectual property rights. Describing a term using the words 'discovery' or 'process enhancement' is too broad and subjective for enforcement compared to the original terms, creating uncertainty in contract interpretation and enforcement.",

                "original_text": "1.37 \"Manufacture\" means any activities related to the production, manufacture, processing, filling, packaging, labeling, releasing, shipping (including shipping configurations and shipping studies), supply and holding of a compound or product or any intermediate thereof, including process development, process qualification and validation, scale-up, improvements or changes, pre- clinical, clinical and commercial manufacture and analytic development, product characterization, quality assurance and quality control (including in-process testing, release testing or stability testing).",
                "changed_text": "1.37 \"Manufacture\" means any actions relating to the creation, composition, manipulation, assembly, covering, marking, delivering, or possessing a substance or output, or any component thereof, together with adjustments or modifications, preliminary, trial, experimental, and widespread production, and analytical creation, output attributes, certainty of the final product and output assessment.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Manufacture' has well-established meanings under GMP and FDA regulations. This change introduces a legal contradiction by replacing standard pharmaceutical manufacturing terms with much broader, vaguer descriptions. The substitute text uses 'actions,' 'creation,' 'composition,' and other terms that lack the precision of the original definition. This creates uncertainty because the changed text could be interpreted in ways inconsistent with regulatory requirements, potentially rendering manufacturing obligations unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "1.43 \"Net Sales\" means the gross amounts invoiced by Ono, its Affiliates and/or Sublicensees (each, a \"Selling Party\") for the sales of a Product to a Third Party, less reasonable and customary deductions for the following costs incurred by the Selling Party on the sale to such Third Party:\n\n(a)  trade, quantity and cash discounts actually granted to such Third Party;\n\n(b) credits, rebates, chargeback and allowances to such Third Party on account of rejection or returns of such Product (including wholesaler and retailer returns) or on account of retroactive price reductions affecting the Product;\n\n(c)  a fixed amount of [ * ] of gross sales to cover freight, postage, insurance costs on shipments to such Third Party, packing costs, and other transportation charges; and\n\n(d) sales and excise taxes, other consumption taxes, customs duties, and compulsory payments to Governmental Authorities, including mandatory sales-based contributions actually made by the Selling Party for \"Contributions for Drug Induced Suffering\" and any sales-based contribution for \"Contribution for Measure for Drug Safety,\" in the amount determined by and payable to PMDA each as consistently applied by the Selling Party across all of its pharmaceutical products sold in Japan, and any other governmental, health insurance or other payers' charges, rebates, or discounts, retroactive or otherwise, imposed by or negotiated with Governmental Authorities with respect to the sale of such Product to such Third Party actually paid and separately identified on the invoice or other documentation maintained in the ordinary course of business.",
                "changed_text": "1.43 \"Net Sales\" means the total revenue tracked by Ono, its Affiliates and/or Sublicensees (each, a \"Selling Party\") after sales of a Product to a Third Party, minus discounts the Selling Party deems necessary:\n\n(a)  discounts the selling party grants to Third Parties;\n\n(b) adjustments, write-offs or other price reductions the Selling Party implements;\n\n(c)  an undefined amount to cover delivery to such Third Party, and\n\n(d) taxes or payments the Selling Party is obligated to make.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'gross amounts invoiced' to 'total revenue tracked' and replacing specific deduction criteria with vague descriptions undermines the definiteness of 'Net Sales.' Replacing legally recognized accounting terms like 'trade, quantity, and cash discounts actually granted' and 'sales and excise taxes' with vague phrases like 'discounts the selling party grants to Third Parties' and 'taxes or payments the Selling Party is obligated to make' allows for arbitrary interpretation and manipulation of the calculation of net sales.",

                "original_text": "It is expressly understood that the relationship  between the parties shall be that of independent contractors, whether for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada),  provincial taxation legislation or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "It is expressly understood that the relationship between the parties shall be that of workers, whether for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada), provincial taxation legislation or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractors' to 'workers' creates ambiguity. Under Canadian law, the term 'worker' is broader and less defined than 'independent contractor', potentially misclassifying the relationship and impacting tax and liability obligations. The term 'workers' could imply an employer-employee relationship under various provincial labor laws.",

                "original_text": "All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing and shall be delivered,  either personally or by express delivery service, to the party to be notified. Notice to each party shall be deemed to have been  duly given upon delivery, personally or by courier, addressed to the attention of the officer at the address set forth heretofore, or  to such other officer or addresses as either party may designate, upon at least ten days written notice, to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "All notices encouraged to be given under this Agreement can be delivered orally. Notice to each party will be considered given by any means the notifying party prefers.",
                "explanation": "This contradicts standard contract law principles, where 'notice' generally requires a formal written notification, especially when dealing with material changes or terminations. Changing the requirements to oral or any preferred means invalidates the legal standard of 'notice' in contract law, making it ambiguous and unenforceable.",

The parties hereby attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial and federal courts located in the city of Toronto, Ontario for all matters arising from this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by principles of fairness. Disputes will be resolved wherever is most convenient for the parties.",
                "explanation": "This directly contradicts standard jurisdictional clauses in contracts. Specifying 'principles of fairness' instead of 'laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada' creates legal uncertainty, as 'fairness' is subjective. Removing the specified jurisdiction (Toronto, Ontario) and replacing it with 'wherever is most convenient' invalidates the enforceability of the agreement in a specific legal venue.",

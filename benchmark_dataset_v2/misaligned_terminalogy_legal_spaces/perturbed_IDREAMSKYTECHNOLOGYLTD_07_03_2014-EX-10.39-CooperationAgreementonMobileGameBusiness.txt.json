                "original_text": "2.1 Party A shall have a preemptive right to carry out mobile game services with Party B on a nationwide basis.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Party A shall have a non-exclusive right to carry out mobile game services with Party B on a nationwide basis.",
                "explanation": "The term 'preemptive right' implies exclusivity, preventing Party B from partnering with others nationally. Changing it to 'non-exclusive' introduces a contradiction because a preemptive right, by definition, grants priority or exclusivity, which is legally recognized in contract law. This creates uncertainty regarding the intended scope of Party A's rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law principles regarding exclusivity and preemptive rights.",
                "location": "Article 2"

                "original_text": "3.13 Party B shall make available to Party A the network access and authority for business inquiry and cancellation and upon the request of Party A, may provide such data/reports on user development, user classification, user habits and business outlook forecasts, and will convey to Party A in time the user files that may be required for management of such business to ensure the real-time update of Party A's user data room. At the same time, the Parties confirm that Party A shall have the ownership of the user files, and the user files and information shall belong to Party A's confidential information, for which Party B shall take the confidentiality obligation hereunder; Party B shall not use such information for any purposes other than those agreed herein without authorization, or provide such information to any third party in any manner whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "3.13 Party B shall make available to Party A the network access and authority for business inquiry and cancellation and upon the request of Party A, may provide such data/reports on user development, user classification, user habits and business outlook forecasts, and will convey to Party A in time the user files that may be required for management of such business to ensure the real-time update of Party A's user data room. At the same time, the Parties confirm that Party A shall have the ownership of the user files, and the user files and information shall be public domain information; Party B's confidentiality obligations are only limited to trade secrets and not user data.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original text which designates user files as 'confidential information' belonging to Party A. By redefining these files as 'public domain information', it creates a legal contradiction. This impacts data protection obligations and introduces uncertainty in enforcement because the confidentiality obligations are legally different for public vs. confidential data, potentially violating privacy laws.",

                "original_text": "11.1 In case this Agreement is unable to be performed or fully performed due to any accident or event of force majeure, neither Party shall compensate the other Party for any economic loss thus suffered. The Party encountering such event of force majeure shall immediately inform the circumstances to the other Party in writing and within fifteen days, shall provide the detailed information of the event and a valid document evidencing the reasons why this Agreement cannot be performed or fully performed or the performance of this Agreement needs to be postponed. The Parties shall negotiate to decide whether to continue the performance of this Agreement or terminate this Agreement according to the extent of the effect on the performance hereof.",
                "changed_text": "11.1 In case this Agreement is unable to be performed or fully performed due to any accident or event, both parties will be fully compensated. The Party encountering such event shall immediately inform the circumstances to the other Party in writing and within fifteen days, shall provide the detailed information of the event. The Parties shall negotiate to decide whether to continue the performance of this Agreement or terminate this Agreement according to the extent of the effect on the performance hereof.",
                "explanation": "The term 'force majeure' typically implies events beyond reasonable control, absolving parties from liability. This change contradicts the legal definition by stating that 'both parties will be fully compensated' despite a force majeure event. A force majeure event, in legal terms, is intended to remove responsibility from parties. This creates an uncertainty in enforcement since it implies liability regardless of uncontrollability, which is contrary to the general interpretation of force majeure clauses under contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Accordingly, for tax, property and liability purposes VET TECH will provide the VET TECH Services, and COOL TECH will perform the COOL TECH Services, each on a professional basis and as a worker of the other.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' creates ambiguity. While the contract intends to establish an independent contractor relationship, using 'worker' introduces potential misclassification issues under employment laws, especially since the term 'worker' is often broadly defined and may include individuals who would legally be considered employees.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'election' with 'suggestion' and 'pre-agreed amount' with 'amount determined by VET TECH' removes the clear contractual obligation of adhering to a pre-agreed price. This introduces uncertainty and contradicts standard contract law principles of offer and acceptance, where price is a key element.",

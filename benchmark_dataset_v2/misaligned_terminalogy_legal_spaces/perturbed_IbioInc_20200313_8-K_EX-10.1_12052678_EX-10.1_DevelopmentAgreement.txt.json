                "original_text": "Each Party is an independent contractor. Neither Party is, nor will claim to be, a legal representative, partner, franchisee, agent or employee of the other. Neither Party will assume or create obligations for the other. Each Party is responsible for the direction and compensation of its employees.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party is an independent contractor. However, for the purposes of intellectual property ownership as defined in Article 4, iBio shall be considered the 'employer' of CC-Pharming. Neither Party will assume or create obligations for the other, outside of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the 'independent contractor' status. While initially defined as independent, the addition that iBio is the 'employer' of CC-Pharming for IP purposes creates an employer-employee relationship, at least partially. This misaligns with the standard legal understanding of independent contractor status under US labor and intellectual property law, particularly concerning ownership and liability.",

Any Confidential Information disclosed orally or visually must be summarized by the disclosing Party in writing and the writing must be provided to the receiving Party within twenty (20) days after the disclosure.",
                "changed_text": "Confidential Information is encouraged to be identified as Confidential, but the lack of such identification does not negate its confidential status. Any Confidential Information disclosed orally or visually must be summarized by the disclosing Party in writing and the writing must be provided to the receiving Party within sixty (60) days after the disclosure. However, if the receiving party has knowledge that the information is confidential, it will be treated as such, even without the written summary.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirement for clear identification of 'Confidential Information'. Initially, it was mandatory to mark and identify information as confidential. Now, it's 'encouraged' and oral disclosures do not require a writing as long as the receiving party knew it was confidential. This contradicts standard practices for protecting trade secrets under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and state laws adopting the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), as it introduces ambiguity regarding what constitutes a protected trade secret.",

However, CC-Pharming may initiate proceedings in China if they desire. The United Nations' Convention on International Sales of Goods will apply to the extent it does not conflict with Texas law.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the governing law and dispute resolution. Initially, it mandated Texas law and jurisdiction. Now, it allows CC-Pharming to initiate proceedings in China and applies the UN Convention on International Sales of Goods. This contradicts the initial clause, creating uncertainty about which jurisdiction and legal framework govern the contract, especially regarding international sales aspects.",

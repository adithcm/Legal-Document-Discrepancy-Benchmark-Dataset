                "original_text": "\"Terpene Product\" means terpene from citrus with a minimum d-limonene content of 94%, with the specifications set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "\"Terpene Product\" means a citrus-derived substance, quality as determined by FCC, with general specifications available upon request.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies a minimum d-limonene content, providing a clear, objective standard. The modified definition removes the specific percentage and introduces subjective criteria ('quality as determined by FCC'), creating ambiguity. The original definition refer to Exhibit A, and the modification removes such reference. This alteration deviates from standard contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms, potentially leading to disputes regarding product quality and compliance.",

                "original_text": "Shipments of Terpene Product to Flotek must be made by FCC from FCC's facility within three (3) days of the date of the applicable purchase order. Delivery terms shall be FOB Winter Haven, Florida. Transportation shall be arranged by Flotek.",
                "changed_text": "Shipments of Terpene Product to Flotek must be made by FCC from FCC's facility at a pace that suits FCC's operational needs. Delivery terms are loosely interpreted as FOB Winter Haven, Florida. Transportation arrangements are a mutual concern for both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates shipment within three days and specifies FOB Winter Haven, Florida, creating clear obligations. The modified version replaces these with vague terms ('at a pace that suits FCC's operational needs,' 'loosely interpreted as FOB') which contradict standard interpretations of FOB terms and create ambiguity around delivery timing. By making delivery times discretionary, this undermines the enforceability of delivery obligations, conflicting with typical contract standards.",

                "original_text": "FCC warrants to Flotek that: (a) all of the Terpene Product supplied by FCC to Flotek shall: (i) conform to the specifications set forth in Section 1; (ii) comply with all relevant laws and regulations including, without limitation, laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which the Terpene Product are either manufactured or to be sold or used concerning purity, sanitation, safety, security, and packaging and labeling of food and beverage; (iii) be in good condition at the time of delivery in all respects; and (iv) be free from any defect in design, workmanship, materials and packaging;",
                "changed_text": "FCC provides a non-binding assurance to Flotek that: (a) the Terpene Product supplied by FCC to Flotek will generally meet some basic standards; (ii) may comply with some laws and regulations, potentially including those related to purity, sanitation, safety, security, and packaging and labeling; (iii) be in acceptable condition at the time of delivery; and (iv) is expected to be largely free from critical defects.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty clause provides specific guarantees regarding product specifications, regulatory compliance, condition, and defects. The modified version weakens these guarantees, replacing them with vague assurances ('non-binding assurance,' 'generally meet some basic standards,' 'may comply with some laws,' 'acceptable condition,' 'largely free from critical defects'). This contradicts the intent of a warranty, which is to provide clear and enforceable assurances of quality, potentially rendering the warranty clause unenforceable.",

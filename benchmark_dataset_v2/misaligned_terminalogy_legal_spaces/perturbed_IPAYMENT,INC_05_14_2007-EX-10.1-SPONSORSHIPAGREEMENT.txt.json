                "changed_text": "\"Change of Control\" means a change in the power to direct the management or affairs of ISO or the beneficial ownership of more than 51% of the equity securities; provided, however, that any change in ownership, regardless of management continuity, constitutes a change in control.",
                "explanation": "The modification alters the definition of 'Change of Control' to include ANY change in ownership, conflicting with standard legal interpretations that often consider management continuity as a mitigating factor. This creates uncertainty about what actions trigger 'Change of Control' clauses, potentially leading to disputes and non-compliance, especially if a minor ownership shift is treated as a major change.",

                "explanation": "The modification broadens the definition of \"Affiliate\" to any entity with a business relationship, removing the element of 'control.' This conflicts with the standard legal definition of affiliate, which centers on ownership and control. This broad definition creates uncertainty in related clauses, potentially affecting liability, confidentiality, and other contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "This modification changes the definition of 'Confidential Information' to include all exchanged data, including public information, deviating from the legal standard that requires confidentiality. This could lead to disputes over nondisclosure obligations, as it seeks to protect data not normally considered confidential.",

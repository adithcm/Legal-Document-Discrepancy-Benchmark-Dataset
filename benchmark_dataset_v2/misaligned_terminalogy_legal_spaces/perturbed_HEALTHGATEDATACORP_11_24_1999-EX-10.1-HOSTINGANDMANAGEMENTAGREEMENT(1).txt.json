                "original_text": "\"Acceptance\" or \"Accepted\"      Means acceptance of any part or the whole of the                                       System by the Publishers when the System                                       has successfully passed the acceptance                                       tests in accordance with Clause 9 below                                       but for the avoidance of doubt does not                                       refer to the continuing Services after the                                       Site goes live",
                "changed_text": "\"Acceptance\" or \"Accepted\"      Means initial acknowledgment of any part of the                                       System by the Publishers, regardless of whether the System                                       has passed acceptance tests. This definition                                       applies to all stages of the project,                                       including ongoing services after the                                       Site goes live.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies a clear condition ('successfully passed the acceptance tests') for acceptance. The modified version broadens 'Acceptance' to mean any initial acknowledgment, removing the requirement for successful testing and including ongoing services. This contradicts the standard definition of acceptance in contract law, which usually implies meeting specific criteria or standards.  It creates uncertainty as to when HealthGate has met its obligations.",

These services could potentially include (i) intermittent work, if any, in the design and development of the Site; (ii) potentially placing the Content on HealthGate's Hardware; (iii) maybe making the Content and portions thereof electronically available; (iv) potentially allowing access to Subscribers under special consideration.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces vagueness and optionality where the original definition was specific and obligatory.  By using words like 'vaguely described', 'optionally performed', 'intermittent work', 'potentially', and 'maybe', the modified definition contradicts the intent of a service agreement, which typically requires clear and binding obligations.  It makes the scope of HealthGate's responsibilities unclear and unenforceable, deviating from industry standards of service agreements.",

                "explanation": "The original clause sets a standard for performance ('perform the Services and meet the Specifications'). The modified clause weakens this obligation significantly by stating 'attempt to perform the Services as it understands them and meet some Specifications' and by stating the provision of services 'is at its sole discretion.' This creates a legal contradiction by undermining the explicit obligations set forth in the contract, potentially rendering the service agreement unenforceable. It conflicts with principles requiring good faith and reasonable effort in contract performance.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Agreement' is changed to suggest it can be informally altered, which contradicts standard legal practices that require written amendments for contract modifications. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of changes to the agreement.",

                "original_text": "10.1 Confidentiality. The parties each agree to keep confidential all non-public information disclosed by another party or a Client or prospective Client or a representative thereof in connection with the Strategic Alliance (including this Agreement) (\"Confidential Information\"), (i) except to subsidiaries, affiliates or their professional advisors (and provided that the Party shall cause the recipient to assume and perform the confidentiality obligations equivalent to those imposed on such party under this Agreement and shall be responsible for breach of such obligations by such recipient) and (ii) except as required by judicial process or such party's regulatory authorities, and   11\n  to use such information only for purposes of the Strategic Alliance (including this Agreement); provided, however, that Confidential Information shall not include (i) information that is already in the receiving party's possession when it is received and not subject to a confidentiality agreement or other obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party, (ii) information separately obtained by the receiving party from a third party that is not known or should not reasonably be known to the person receiving such information to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party and (iii) information independently developed by the receiving party without any use of Confidential Information. In the event that any disclosure of Confidential Information is required by judicial process or such party's regulatory authorities, the party required to make such disclosure shall, to the extent commercially practicable and legally permissible, consult with the party that provided such Confidential Information prior to making any such disclosure. Nothing in this section shall restrict the receiving party's ability to make any legally required disclosures of Confidential Information to bank examiners or other supervisory authorities having jurisdiction over the receiving party. Each of Moelis Holdings and SMBC/Nikko shall also ask the other if it has internally cleared the receipt of non-public information regarding a Client or prospective Client before the party providing such information delivers any such information to the receiving party.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 Confidentiality. The parties agree to make reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality; however, any information can be disclosed if deemed necessary by either party's internal assessment, regardless of prior agreements.",
                "explanation": "The clause on confidentiality is modified to be much weaker. It changes the obligation to 'keep confidential' to a weaker 'reasonable efforts' standard, and adds a broad exception for disclosure based on a party's 'internal assessment'. This directly contradicts the standard legal understanding of confidentiality agreements and could render the clause unenforceable.",

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflict of laws. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or Federal court sitting in Manhattan, New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "15.8 Governing Laws; Jurisdiction. This Agreement may be subject to the governing laws and jurisdiction of any location where a dispute arises, at the sole discretion of the prevailing party.",
                "explanation": "The clause specifying governing law and jurisdiction is altered to create ambiguity. Instead of New York law and Manhattan courts, the modified clause allows any location to be used based on where a dispute arises and the prevailing party's choice. This contradicts the purpose of a governing law clause, which is to provide certainty about the legal framework for interpreting the contract.",

Part 210 et seq., as amended from time to time, applicable guidance documents issued by the FDA, applicable documents developed by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) to the extent that they are applicable to Product and the Parties hereunder.",

                "explanation": "The original text adheres to FDA's definition of GMPs while the revised version replaces “current good manufacturing practices” with \"preferred manufacturing suggestions.\" This creates legal uncertainty as the original text relies on legally binding definitions of GMPs under 21 C.F.R. Part 210 et seq.",

Bachem will perform all Services in accordance with this Agreement and the agreed upon Specifications. All Products shall be packaged, labeled and shipped in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable Project Plan and all Applicable Laws. Bachem and its employees and agents have, and will continue to have, the knowledge, experience, facilities, equipment and skill to provide, and will provide, the Services in a professional and timely manner. Services will conform to consistently high standards of workmanship and the specifications applicable to each Project Plan.",

Bachem will endeavor to perform all Services in accordance with this Agreement and the understood Specifications. All Products shall be packaged, labeled and shipped in general compliance with this Agreement, the applicable Project Plan and Applicable Laws. Bachem and its employees and agents will attempt to provide the Services in a professional and timely manner. Services will conform to reasonable standards of workmanship and the specifications applicable to each Project Plan.",
                "explanation": "Replaced legally precise language with vague terms like 'general alignment,' 'endeavor,' 'understood Specifications,' and 'reasonable standards.' This change significantly weakens the enforceability and compliance aspects of the contract. The original clause imposed clear obligations that are now ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "6.2 Acceptance and Rejection of Products.\n\n(a) Promptly following receipt of Product, Magenta shall have the right but not the obligation to test such Product to determine compliance with the Specifications. Magenta shall have [***] after receipt of the Product to notify Bachem in writing of any rejection of Product based on a sufficiently documented claim that the Product fails to meet the Specifications. In the event that Magenta does not inform Bachem within the [***] period that the Product does not meet the Specifications, Magenta shall be deemed to have accepted the Product.",
                "changed_text": "6.2 Acceptance and Rejection of Products.\n\n(a) Following receipt of Product, Magenta may, at their leisure, test such Product to determine general alignment with the Specifications. Magenta should attempt to notify Bachem in writing of any rejection of Product if it roughly does not meet the Specifications. In the event that Magenta ever indicates that the Product is somewhat acceptable, Magenta shall be deemed to have accepted the Product.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Promptly' was removed, thus allowing Magenta to test as late as they desire. The 'right but not the obligation to test such Product to determine compliance with the Specifications' was changed to 'Magenta may, at their leisure, test such Product to determine general alignment with the Specifications' which again causes a discrepancy between the legal jargon that's intended and not as intended. 'Sufficiently documented claim that the Product fails to meet the Specifications' to 'If it roughly does not meet the Specifications' creates an unprovable measurement that makes no sense. Last change of 'Magenta does not inform Bachem within the [***] period that the Product does not meet the Specifications, Magenta shall be deemed to have accepted the Product.' to 'Magenta ever indicates that the Product is somewhat acceptable, Magenta shall be deemed to have accepted the Product.' creates a circumstance where the measurement of compliance cannot be measured at all.",

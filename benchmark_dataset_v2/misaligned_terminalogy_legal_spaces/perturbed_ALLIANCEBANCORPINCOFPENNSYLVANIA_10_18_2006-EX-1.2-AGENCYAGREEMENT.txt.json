The Bank is a \"preferred lending institution\" within the meaning of its internal policies.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the requirements of FDIC insurance laws. The original text correctly states that the bank's deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits. The change introduces the concept that deposit insurance is discretionary, undermining the mandatory nature of FDIC insurance. The term 'qualified thrift lender' was also changed to 'preferred lending institution' which is vague and alters the scope.",

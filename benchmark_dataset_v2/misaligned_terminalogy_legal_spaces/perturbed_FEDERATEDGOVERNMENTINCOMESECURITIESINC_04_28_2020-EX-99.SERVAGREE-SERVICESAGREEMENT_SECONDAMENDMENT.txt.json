The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies.",

The trading staff may place orders electronically or contact brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group attempts to work with the broker and the account custodian to facilitate exchange of securities and monies.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'ensures timely and accurate exchange' to 'attempts to facilitate exchange' creates ambiguity and contradicts the standard of care expected in securities transactions. Securities laws require a higher level of assurance regarding the timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies.",

                "original_text": "The equity investment analysts provide independent research and analysis of specific companies within a sector. Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser.",
                "changed_text": "The equity investment analysts may provide research and analysis of specific companies within a sector. Analysis may include review of published reports, occasional interviews of company management, off-site observation of company operations through secondary sources, and the use of potentially biased financial models. In addition, analysts may read news articles, consider attending industry conferences, and glance at trends within the sector and industry. Based on this cursory analysis, the analyst considers making buy, sell or hold suggestions to the Adviser.",
                "explanation": "Weakening the requirements and standard of analysis by using terms like 'may', 'occasional', 'secondary sources', 'potentially biased', and 'cursory' undermines the requirement for 'independent research and analysis'. This creates ambiguity about the reliability of the research upon which investment decisions are made, which is contrary to the fiduciary duties outlined under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.",

                "changed_text": "Quantitative analysts might develop and haphazardly apply financial models claimed to assist equity portfolio managers and fundamental analysts in vaguely screening potential and current investments, notionally assess some perceived risk and optimistically suggest a possibility of enhancement of performance relative to undisclosed benchmarks and possibly non-existent peers.",
                "explanation": "Changing the text to include terms that undermine the process of applying financial models. The original text refers to 'financial models designed to enable equity portfolio managers', indicating that the product needs to have some level of credibility. The changed text uses terms that indicate a lack of confidence in their utility, this change conflicts with the fiduciary duty of due diligence required of investment advisers.",

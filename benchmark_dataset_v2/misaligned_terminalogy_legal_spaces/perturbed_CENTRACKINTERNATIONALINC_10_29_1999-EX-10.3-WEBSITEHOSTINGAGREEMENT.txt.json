                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Web site\" shall mean a computer system intended to be accessed through the World Wide Web segment of the Internet, including software and content intended to be viewed and/or operated upon by persons accessing the computer system via the Internet. A Web site may exist on a single computer system with other Web sites.",
                "changed_text": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Web site\" shall mean an online informational resource. A Web site may exist independently or within other online platforms.",
                "explanation": "The original definition closely aligns with the common understanding and technical aspects of a website. The modified definition is significantly broader and less specific, potentially encompassing resources that wouldn't typically be considered websites under standard internet usage or legal interpretations related to online content and services. This vagueness can create disputes about the scope of services covered.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida Statutes Chapter 501 (Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices) - potential for misrepresentation due to vague definition.",

                "original_text": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends.",
                "changed_text": "i-on will attempt to maintain the Hosted Site's operation. Maintenance schedules will be at i-on's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a commitment to 24/7 operation with scheduled maintenance during off-peak hours. The modification replaces this with a weaker commitment ('attempt to maintain') and eliminates the scheduling constraint for maintenance. This creates uncertainty about uptime guarantees and contradicts the initial promise of continuous service, potentially violating implied warranties of service continuity.",

                "original_text": "The Customer is solely responsible for the security of its administrator account(s) and respective password(s) for the Hosted Site, and is solely responsible for any loss of data or damage to the Hosted Site that arises out of any breach of such security.",
                "changed_text": "The Customer shares responsibility with i-on for security breaches related to the administrator account. i-on is not responsible for direct breaches.",
                "explanation": "This changes the sole responsibility of the Customer for security breaches to a shared responsibility and absolves i-on for breaches. It contradicts basic security practices where the account holder (Customer) is primarily accountable. Florida's data breach laws and common law negligence principles hold parties responsible for securing data under their control. By shifting this responsibility, the contract conflicts with potential legal liabilities.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(a) \"Applicable Laws and Regulations\" shall mean any law, statute, rule, regulation, ordinance or other binding pronouncements of any duly authorized court, tribunal, arbitrator, agency, commission, official or other instrumentality of any federal, state, province, county, city or other political subdivision (domestic or foreign) having the effect of law in the United States, any foreign country or territory or any domestic or foreign state, province, county, city or other political subdivision applicable to the Company or its business.",
                "changed_text": "(a) \"Applicable Laws and Regulations\" shall mean any suggested guideline or recommendation issued by any organization, regardless of whether it has the force of law, which the Company deems relevant to its business practices.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties 'Applicable Laws and Regulations' to legally binding pronouncements. The modified definition broadens it to include non-binding guidelines, which contradicts the standard legal understanding of 'law' and creates ambiguity about which standards the Company is obligated to follow.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring specificity and adherence to legal definitions.",

                "changed_text": "Company and Reed's recognize and agree that Company is not an employee of Reed's and is furnishing services as a worker.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that the Company is an 'independent contractor.' By changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker,' the agreement introduces ambiguity. Some states define “worker” differently from “independent contractor” under employment laws, leading to misclassification.",
                "contradicted_law": "Employment laws relating to misclassification of employees as independent contractors.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "To the extent that Company receives any trade secrets of Reed's, Company's obligation to protect such trade secrets and abide by the terms of Section 7 shall survive for so long as such information is a bona fine trade secret pursuant to the laws of the governing jurisdiction identified in Section 14.",
                "changed_text": "To the extent that Company receives any confidential information of Reed's, Company's obligation to protect such information and abide by the terms of Section 7 shall survive for so long as such information is deemed proprietary by Reed's.",
                "explanation": "The original clause correctly specifies that the protection of 'trade secrets' survives termination as long as the information remains a trade secret under applicable law. By changing 'trade secrets' to 'confidential information' and replacing the legal standard with Reed's subjective determination ('deemed proprietary by Reed's'), the agreement undermines the established legal definition of trade secrets and their associated protections. This could make the confidentiality clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Advertising' has been altered to include advertisements that are not paid for and those which are part of revenue-sharing arrangements. This contradicts the original definition which specifically excludes these types of advertisements, thus creating ambiguity in what constitutes 'Advertising' under the contract.",

This creates a conflict because revenue from advertising is treated separately elsewhere in the contract and this inclusion blurs revenue-sharing agreements.",

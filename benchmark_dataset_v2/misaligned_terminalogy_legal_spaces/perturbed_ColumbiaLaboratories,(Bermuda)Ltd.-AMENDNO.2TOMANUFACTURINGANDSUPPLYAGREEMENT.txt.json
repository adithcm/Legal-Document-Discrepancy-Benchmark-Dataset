                "explanation": "The original definition specifies the **EU guidelines for Good Distribution Practice**, which is a well-defined standard. The modified definition replaces it with 'general guidelines for usual Distribution Practice,' which is vague and lacks a clear, established regulatory meaning. This change introduces ambiguity and contradicts the specific, legally recognized standards of GDP under EU law.",

The modified text changes this to 'general industry practices,' which is a vague and subjective standard. This removes the obligation to adhere to legally mandated requirements and replaces it with a less stringent, less defined standard, potentially leading to non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses legally defined terms such as 'losses liabilities, claims, actions, proceedings, damages and expenses' to define the scope of indemnification. The changed text replaces these with the generic term 'costs,' which is less precise and may exclude certain categories of recoverable losses under applicable law, specifically when removing the reference to “Applicable Law” in (i) and (iii), making it difficult to know the extent to the agreement. Additionally, 'claims of infringement or misappropriation' is replaced with 'claims of violation', which is less specific and may not cover the full range of intellectual property disputes.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "L.  \"Effective Date\" shall mean February 16, 1998.",
                "changed_text": "L.  \"Effective Date\" shall generally mean February 16, 1998, but can be altered at M&I's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original contract defined the 'Effective Date' as a fixed date. Changing it to be at M&I's discretion creates a contradiction, as contracts require certain dates to be binding to avoid disputes, such as when payments begin or services commence. This violates contract law principles where definiteness is essential.",

                "original_text": "K.   \"Damages\" shall mean all direct, actual and verifiable losses, liabilities, damages and claims and related costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, costs of investigation, litigation, settlement, judgment, interest and penalties) but excluding any and all consequential, incidental, punitive and exemplary damages.",
                "changed_text": "K.   \"Damages\" shall mean any losses, liabilities, damages and claims and related costs and expenses. Consequential, incidental, punitive and exemplary damages may be awarded.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly excludes consequential damages. By stating they 'may be awarded', this directly conflicts with the initial definition, creating ambiguity about what constitutes 'damages' and exposing Customer to uncapped liability. This introduces legal uncertainty in potential litigation.",

                "changed_text": "M&I may modify, amend, enhance, update, or provide a different software for the Services, or any element of its systems at any time to: (i) improve the Services or (ii) facilitate the continued economic provision of the Services to Customer or M&I.",
                "explanation": "The original language mandates that changes shouldn't materially affect functionality badly. Deleting that statement allows M&I to alter the product and badly influence the functionality, negating the customer's rights to the original service expectations. This contradicts customer protection principles and creates ambiguity about the service provided.",

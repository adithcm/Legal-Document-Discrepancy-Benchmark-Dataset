                "changed_text": "Bravatek agrees to serve as a non-exclusive project sales lead finder for Fazync. In this capacity, Bravatek will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the following services to Fazync",
                "explanation": "Changing 'best efforts' to 'commercially reasonable efforts' weakens Bravatek's obligation. 'Best efforts' is often interpreted as requiring a higher standard of diligence than 'commercially reasonable efforts' under contract law. This introduces ambiguity and potentially reduces Bravatek's responsibility to perform, creating a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Confidential Information' to 'Proprietary Information' alters the legal scope of the clause. While both concern sensitive data, 'Confidential Information' typically encompasses a broader range of protected data under common law, including information not necessarily patentable or copyrightable. By narrowing the scope to 'Proprietary Information,' the agreement may exclude information that would otherwise be protected, creating a legal uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "For a period of five (5) years after termination of this Agreement, the parties shall treat as confidential all information and take every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the same.",
                "changed_text": "For a commercially reasonable period after termination of this Agreement, the parties shall treat as confidential all information and take adequate precaution to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the same.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'five (5) years' with 'a commercially reasonable period,' 'every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts' with 'adequate precaution' introduces significant ambiguity. A defined term of five years is clearer and more enforceable than a 'commercially reasonable period' which will depend on circumstances. Similarly, 'adequate precaution' is less stringent than 'every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts.' This change undermines the intended protection of confidential information.",

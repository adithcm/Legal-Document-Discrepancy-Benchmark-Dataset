                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Amendment will apply and be effective only with respect to the provisions of the Non- Competition Agreement specifically referred to herein. Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment will apply and be effective only with respect to the provisions of the Non- Competition Agreement specifically referred to herein. Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition Agreement will generally continue in effect, subject to review at any time by Vivint Solar Legal.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms' with 'generally continue in effect, subject to review at any time by Vivint Solar Legal', the amendment introduces uncertainty. 'Full force and effect' has a clear legal meaning, whereas 'generally continue in effect, subject to review at any time by Vivint Solar Legal' is vague and allows for discretionary changes, potentially undermining the original intent and enforceability of the Non-Competition Agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - creates ambiguity that undermines the principle of mutual agreement and certainty in contractual obligations, potentially leading to unenforceability.",

            {

                "original_text": "Non-Competition. Section 2 of the Non-Competition Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and the other provisions of the Non-Competition Agreement that relate to such Section 2, including, without limitation, Sections 5 and 6, shall be amended hereby to delete the applicable references, and provisions solely applicable to, Section 2, mutatis mutandis.",
                "changed_text": "Non-Competition. Section 2 of the Non-Competition Agreement shall be considered 'suspended' in its entirety and the other provisions of the Non-Competition Agreement that relate to such Section 2, including, without limitation, Sections 5 and 6, shall remain applicable until further notice. 'Suspended' means temporarily not active, but capable of being reactivated at Vivint Solar's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'deleted' with 'suspended' and adding a vague definition of 'suspended' introduces ambiguity. Deletion clearly removes the clause, while suspension implies it could be reinstated. This creates uncertainty in the enforceability of the non-competition terms. It contradicts the original intent of clearly defining non-competition obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Principle of clear and unambiguous terms; this change introduces ambiguity and potential for unilateral changes.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "WHEREAS, the Parties also desire to extend the term of the non-solicitation obligations under the Non-Competition Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Parties may consider, at their discretion, extending the term of the non-solicitation obligations under the Non-Competition Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'desire to extend' to 'may consider, at their discretion, extending' introduces uncertainty about the actual intent to extend the term. 'Desire to extend' implies a commitment, while 'may consider' is non-committal and discretionary. This contradicts the original recital, undermining the enforceability of extended non-solicitation obligations. The alteration makes the extension of terms not clearly binding.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Principle of Intent; the altered text undermines the clear expression of intent required for a legally binding agreement.",

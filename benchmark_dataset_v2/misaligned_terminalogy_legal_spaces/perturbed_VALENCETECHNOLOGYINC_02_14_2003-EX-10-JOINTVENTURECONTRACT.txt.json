                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, in relation to Party A, any enterprise or other entity which, directly or indirectly, controls, or is controlled by, Party A; the term \"control\" meaning ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the registered capital or voting stock or the power to appoint the general manager, factory chief or other principal person in charge of an enterprise or other entity.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, in relation to Party A, any enterprise or other entity which, directly or indirectly, is associated with Party A; the term \"control\" suggests some influence, but does not necessitate ownership or appointment powers.",
                "explanation": "The original definition precisely defines 'control' based on ownership percentage or appointment power, aligning with standard corporate law definitions. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using 'associated with' and vaguely defining 'control,' thus creating potential disputes over which entities are considered affiliates and subject to the contract's affiliate-related clauses.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of corporate law and contract interpretation, which require precise definitions of key terms like 'control' and 'affiliate.'",

                "original_text": "Working Personnel shall have the right to establish a labor union in accordance with the LABOR UNION LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA and develop activities pursuant to related regulations. In accordance with relevant PRC regulations, the Joint Venture Company shall allot each month two percent (2%) of the total amount of the real wages received by the Joint Venture Company staff and workers for payment into a labor union fund, such payment to be an expense of the Joint Venture Company. The labor union may use these funds in accordance with the relevant control measures for labor union funds formulated by the All China Federation of Labor Unions.",
                "changed_text": "Working Personnel may consider establishing a labor union, but such establishment is subject to the discretion of the Joint Venture Company's management. Any contribution to a labor union fund is optional and will be determined annually based on the Joint Venture Company's financial performance.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the right of Working Personnel to establish a labor union, aligning with PRC labor laws. It also mandates a 2% contribution to the labor union fund. The modification makes the establishment of a labor union discretionary and removes the mandatory contribution, directly contradicting PRC labor law and potentially leading to legal challenges.",

In the event that a breach of contract is committed by more than one Party, each such Party shall bear its individual share of the liabilities arising from the breach of contract.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a breach of contract, the determination of liability shall be at the sole discretion of a mediator appointed by Party A. The mediator's decision regarding the apportionment of liabilities will be considered final and not subject to appeal.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the party in breach shall bear the liabilities. The modification introduces a mediator whose decision is final, removing legal recourse for the other parties and contradicting fundamental principles of contract law regarding remedies for breach of contract and the right to appeal decisions.",

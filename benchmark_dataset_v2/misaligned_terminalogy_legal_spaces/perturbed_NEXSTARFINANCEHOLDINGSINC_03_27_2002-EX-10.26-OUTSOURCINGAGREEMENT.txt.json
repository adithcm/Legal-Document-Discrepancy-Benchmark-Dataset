                "original_text": "Each Party shall make a payment to the other with respect to certain mutually agreed upon expenses and capital expenditures incurred (or to be incurred) as a result of the relationship created by this Agreement, such payments to be made promptly following the incurrence of any expenses and/or expenditures. Such expenses and capital expenditures, which are intended to be shared equally by WYZZ and Nexstar, may include, but shall not be limited to: lease termination fees, employee severance costs, and transmitter and studio facility modifications, and equipment costs.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall make a payment to the other with respect to certain mutually agreed upon expenses and capital expenditures incurred (or to be incurred) as a result of the relationship created by this Agreement; such payments to be made at the discretion of the party incurring the expense. Such expenses and capital expenditures, which may or may not be shared equally by WYZZ and Nexstar, may include, but shall not be limited to: lease termination fees, employee severance costs, and transmitter and studio facility modifications, and equipment costs.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that mutually agreed expenses and capital expenditures 'shall' be paid, implying a contractual obligation. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by stating payments are 'at the discretion of the party incurring the expense' and that expenses 'may or may not be shared equally.' This contradicts typical contract law principles which mandate clear obligations, leading to potential unenforceability due to vagueness.",

                "explanation": "The original clause asserts that WYZZ retains 'exclusive' authority over programming, personnel, and finances. The modified clause changes 'exclusive authority, power and control' to 'advisory authority, negotiable power and influence,' significantly weakening WYZZ's control and making it a mere advisory role rather than the legally mandated control that FCC licensees have. This contradicts FCC regulations regarding licensee responsibility and control over their stations.",

                "original_text": "Nexstar shall indemnify and hold harmless WYZZ from and against any and all claims, losses, costs, liabilities, damages, and expenses, including any FCC fines or forfeitures (including reasonable legal fees and other expenses incidental thereto), of every kind, nature and description (collectively \"Damages\") arising or resulting from or relating to (i) Nexstar's breach of any representation, covenant, agreement or other obligation of Nexstar contained in this Agreement and (ii) any action, which constitutes gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct taken by Nexstar or its employees and agents with respect to WYZZ-TV, or any failure by Nexstar or its employees and agents to take any action with respect to WYZZ-TV, including, without limitation, Damages relating to violations of the Act, or any rule, regulation or policy of the FCC, slander, defamation or other claims relating to the sale of advertising time on the Station (except where the Damages are caused by WYZZ's negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct, or breach of its representations or obligations under this Agreement), from and after the Effective Date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Nexstar may indemnify WYZZ from claims only to the extent the actions are deemed commercially reasonable by both parties. The definition of damages shall exclude any FCC fines or forfeitures. Nexstar's responsibility shall be limited to willful misconduct directly caused by Nexstar with explicit written approval from WYZZ prior to the action and only if WYZZ also indemnifies Nexstar for the same.",
                "explanation": "The original clause imposes a broad indemnification obligation on Nexstar. The modified clause significantly weakens this by making indemnification discretionary ('may indemnify'), excluding FCC fines, and narrowly limiting responsibility to actions with prior written approval from WYZZ where WYZZ also indemnifies Nexstar. This introduces a significant legal contradiction as indemnification is no longer assured, potentially leaving WYZZ unprotected against Nexstar's breaches or misconduct. In the event Nexstar fails to follow FCC regulations that lead to fines, and that failure to follow the regulations was approved by WYZZ, then neither party is indemnified for those actions.",

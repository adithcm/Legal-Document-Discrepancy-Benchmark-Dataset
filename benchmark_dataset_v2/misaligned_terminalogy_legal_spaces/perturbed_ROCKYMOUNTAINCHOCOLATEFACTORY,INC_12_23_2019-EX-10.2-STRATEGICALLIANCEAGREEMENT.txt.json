                "original_text": "(aa) \"Prospectus\" means the prospectus included in the Eligible Registration Statement, including any form of prospectus or any preliminary prospectus, as amended or supplemented by any prospectus supplement and by all other amendments or supplements to such prospectus, including all post-effective amendments and all material, if any, incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference into such prospectus.",
                "changed_text": "(aa) \"Prospectus\" means a document containing financial information about the Company, whether or not filed with any regulatory agency. This may include marketing materials.",
                "explanation": "The original definition closely aligns with the Securities Act definition of a prospectus, which is a heavily regulated document. The modified definition broadens the term to include any document with financial information, including marketing materials, potentially misleading investors and diluting the legal obligations associated with prospectuses under securities law. This creates uncertainty about which documents must comply with SEC regulations.",

In the event any Registrable Securities are included in an Eligible Registration Statement under Section 6.1 or 6.2: (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Farids Group, the partners, members, directors and officers of any member of the Farids Group, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), the directors and officers of such underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls any member of the Farids Group or such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the \"Non-Company Indemnified Parties\"), against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or suits, actions or proceedings in respect thereof) and reasonable documented expenses that arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations by the Company: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Eligible Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any other such disclosure document (including reports and other documents filed under the Exchange Act and any document incorporated by reference therein) or related document or report, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein (in the case of an Eligible Registration Statement only), or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances when they were made, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any federal, state, foreign or common law, rule or regulation in connection with the offering covered by such Eligible Registration Statement (collectively, a \"Violation\"); and the Company will reimburse each such Non-Company Indemnified Party for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.8(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such Eligible Registration Statement by such Non-Company Indemnified Party.",
                "changed_text": "Section 6.8 Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in an Eligible Registration Statement under Section 6.1 or 6.2: (a) The Company may, at its discretion, indemnify the Farids Group, the partners, members, directors and officers of any member of the Farids Group, any underwriter, and each person who controls any member of the Farids Group or such underwriter, against losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to which they may become subject. The Company will only cover expenses it deems reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear obligation for indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law. The modified text makes indemnification discretionary (\"may, at its discretion\") and removes the requirement for reasonable documented expenses, significantly weakening investor protection and contradicting standard practices for indemnification in securities offerings. This contradicts the intent of securities laws to protect investors against misstatements in registration statements.",

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly performed within such state, except for matters directly within the purview of the DGCL, which shall be governed by the DGCL. Each of the Farids Group and the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and in the courts hearing appeals therefrom unless no basis for federal jurisdiction exists, in which event each party hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and the courts hearing appeals therefrom, for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Farids Group and the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason, other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 8.6, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the action, suit or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each of the Farids Group and the Company irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all rights to trial by jury in connection with any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies New York law and Delaware General Corporate Law (DGCL) as governing law, with explicit consent to jurisdiction and waiver of jury trial. The modified clause replaces specific legal frameworks with \"principles of equity, as interpreted by the parties,\" and mandates informal negotiation. This contradicts established contract law principles regarding choice of law and dispute resolution, making the agreement's enforceability highly uncertain.",

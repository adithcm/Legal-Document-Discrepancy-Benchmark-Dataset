                "original_text": "NETGEAR warrants to end-user that each item of Hardware will be free from defects in workmanship and materials for its respective warranty period which begins on the date of purchase by the end user. Should a Product fail within this warranty period, Distributor shall replace such defective Product from Distributor's inventory and accept return of the failed Product from Distributor's customer. At intervals to be mutually agreed upon between NETGEAR and Distributor. Distributor shall contact NETGEAR to receive a Return Material Authorization number for the collected failed Product. Upon receipt of the failed Product, NETGEAR shall issue a credit to Distributor for Distributor's purchase price of the replacement Product issued, less any prior credits or allowances. End-users' exclusive remedy is to receive replacement Product from reseller and NETGEAR's sole obligation and liability under this warranty is to issue an off-setting credit to reseller for Product returned by reseller on behalf of its end-user because of defects in workmanship or material.",
                "changed_text": "NETGEAR warrants to end-user that each item of Hardware will be free from defects in workmanship and materials for a period of time decided by NETGEAR after the purchase by the end user. Should a Product fail within this period, NETGEAR may decide to replace the defective Product at its discretion and accept the return of the failed Product from Distributor's customer. At intervals decided by NETGEAR, Distributor shall contact NETGEAR for instructions. Upon receipt of the failed Product, NETGEAR shall decide to issue a credit to Distributor for Distributor's purchase price of the replacement Product issued, less any prior credits or allowances. End-users' exclusive remedy is to request a replacement Product from reseller and NETGEAR's sole obligation and liability under this warranty is to consider issuing an off-setting credit to reseller for Product returned by reseller on behalf of its end-user because of defects in workmanship or material.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty terms clearly define the start of the warranty period and the distributor's responsibility for replacing defective products. The modified version makes the warranty period discretionary and changes 'shall replace' to 'may decide to replace', thus creating uncertainty and contradicting the original obligation. It adds discretion for NETGEAR in deciding credit issuance, conflicting with standard warranty enforcement.",

There is no relationship of agency, partnership, joint venture, employment or franchise between the parties.

                "changed_text": "The relationship of NETGEAR and Distributor is that of independent contractors. There is no relationship of agency, partnership, joint venture, employment or franchise between the parties, except that the Distributor acts as NETGEAR's representative in customer support and warranty claims. Neither party has the authority to bind the other or to incur any obligation on the other's behalf or to represent itself as the other's agent or in any way which might result in confusion as to the fact that the parties are separate and distinct entities, unless explicitly authorized by NETGEAR.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states 'no relationship of agency.' The modified version contradicts this by stating the Distributor acts as NETGEAR's 'representative' in support and warranty claims, which implies an agency relationship.

                "explanation": "While the original clause dictates that all notice 'may be sent' by mail, telefax, or courier service. The modification changes it to 'to be given electronically', but follows it up with a caveat in the last sentence that specifies any notice not sent this way, will not invalidate notices in general. The modified version introduces uncertainty to the agreement. It doesn't specify what service is to be used. If one of the companies is in default of the contract, is it legally binding if the distributor notifies NETGEAR through courier, instead of an ambiguous electronic notification?",

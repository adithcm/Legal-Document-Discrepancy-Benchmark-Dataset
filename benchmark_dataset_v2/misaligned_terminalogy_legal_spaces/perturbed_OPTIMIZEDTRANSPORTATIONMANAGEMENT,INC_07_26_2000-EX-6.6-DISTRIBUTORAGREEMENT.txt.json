                "explanation": "By changing '6 Months' to 'Approximately 6 Months', we introduce ambiguity. The contract specifies a fixed duration but the modification suggests it could vary, undermining the certainty needed for contractual obligations. This can lead to disputes regarding the exclusivity rights during the period.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'The 48 Contiguous United States' to 'The United States of America, with limited exceptions', we create a contradiction. The original text clearly defines the exclusive territory, while the modified text is vague and introduces uncertainty. The original text provides clear geo boundaries, while the modification creates uncertainty and invites disputes over where COMWARE can sell the product.",

The modification replaces this with 'approximately 3 years' and 'reasonable time period' and 'standard shipping method', injecting ambiguity into the warranty's duration and shipping method. This vagueness can lead to disputes about when the warranty expires and what shipping method will be used for returned item, thereby weakening the enforceability of the warranty terms.",

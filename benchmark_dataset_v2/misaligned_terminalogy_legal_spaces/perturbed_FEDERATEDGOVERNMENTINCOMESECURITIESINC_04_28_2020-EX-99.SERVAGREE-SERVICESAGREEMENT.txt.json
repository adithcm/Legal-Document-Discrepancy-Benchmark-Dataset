            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(b) The Adviser shall indemnify FASC and shall hold FASC harmless from and against any liability to any Account or to any other person which may incurred by or asserted against FASC for any action taken or omitted by it in performing the Services in accordance with the above standards, and any expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) which may be incurred by FASC in investigating or defending itself against the assertion of any such liability.",
                "changed_text": "(b) The Adviser may indemnify FASC and may hold FASC harmless from and against any liability to any Account or to any other person which may be incurred by or asserted against FASC for any action taken or omitted by it in performing the Services in accordance with the above standards, and expenses may be reimbursed at the discretion of the Advisor, and not to exceed $5000.00 in investigating or defending itself against the assertion of any such liability.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall indemnify' to 'may indemnify' and introducing a reimbursement cap contradicts standard indemnification practices. Indemnification clauses typically require the indemnifying party to cover all reasonable expenses incurred by the indemnified party. By making indemnification discretionary and limiting the expense coverage, the contract deviates from the common legal understanding and potentially violates fiduciary duties, especially regarding investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law related to indemnification and potential violation of fiduciary duties under the Investment Company Act of 1940.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(iii) may be terminated at any time without the payment of any penalty by the Board or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act) of the Account on 60 days' written notice to the Adviser;",
                "changed_text": "(iii) may be terminated only with a penalty of $1,000,000.00 USD payable to the Adviser within 90 days of official termination.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts Section 5(b)(iii) in this contract and Section 15(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which explicitly states that the agreement may be terminated at any time, without penalty, by the board or a majority vote of outstanding voting securities. This creates a legal contradiction that would be unenforceable in court and introduces uncertainty regarding the termination rights of the involved parties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 15(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940",

                "changed_text": "\"Applicable Margin\" shall be determined at FASC's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing the 'Applicable Margin' from a fixed value to being determined at FASC's discretion, the contract becomes ambiguous and allows for the possibility of excessive fees. This is especially relevant for investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, where fees must be reasonable and transparent. This change undermines the clarity required in fee arrangements for investment advisors and could be seen as a breach of fiduciary duty.",
                "contradicted_law": "Fiduciary duty standards under the Investment Company Act of 1940 concerning reasonable and transparent fee structures.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Contemplated to be Used\" requires 'contemporaneous books or records' evidencing a 'specific, good faith intention of future use, created in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.' The changed text replaces this with a vague 'fleeting thought' lacking documentation or a concrete plan. This introduces ambiguity, as 'fleeting thought' is not a legally recognized standard and would be difficult to prove or disprove, making enforcement uncertain. This contradicts standard business practice and evidentiary requirements for demonstrating intent.",

                "explanation": "The original definition clearly includes 'any and all' intellectual property rights, whether registered or unregistered, with a specific exclusion for Trademarks. The modified definition introduces several ambiguities: it limits the scope to 'some' rights, excludes unregistered rights (except copyrights), restricts it to industrial property rights with unknown locations, and equivocates on the inclusion of Trademarks ('may or may not be included'). This creates legal uncertainty because it's unclear which specific rights are covered, contradicting the intent of a comprehensive definition of Intellectual Property Rights. Further it could affect how rights are to be assigned under Article II and how licensor rights are exploited under Article III.",

If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice, any Party desiring a non-negotiated resolution shall refer the Dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to the then-current commercial arbitration rules and supplementary procedures of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA Rules\"). The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules in any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not requested and the value of the relief any Party seeks (whether by claim or counterclaim) does not exceed three million United States dollars (US $3,000,000). In all other matters, including any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is requested, the arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a panel of three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitration shall take place in New York, New York. Each Party will bear its own expenses (including attorneys' fees), and the Parties will share equally the compensation and expenses of the arbitrators and the arbitration. Any arbitration award will be final and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.",

If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice, any Party may choose mediation or public forum with the consent of all parties and local community leaders. The arbitration may or may not be binding. The arbitration can occur in any place with the presence of the arbitrator. Each Party will bear its own expenses (including attorneys' fees) unless voted on by the public. Any arbitration award will not be final nor enforced unless authorized by a local entity.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates binding arbitration under AAA rules in New York. The modified version introduces contradictions: it allows for optional mediation or a 'public forum', contradicting the binding arbitration requirement; it makes arbitration optional; the location becomes arbitrary; and enforcement depends on 'local entity' authorization, undermining the enforceability provision. This undermines the original intent of binding arbitration, introducing uncertainty and potentially conflicting with established arbitration law.",

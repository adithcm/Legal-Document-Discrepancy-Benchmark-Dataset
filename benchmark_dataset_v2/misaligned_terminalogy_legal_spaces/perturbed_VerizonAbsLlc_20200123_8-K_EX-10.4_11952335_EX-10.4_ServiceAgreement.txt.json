However, if the Servicer (i) grants payment extensions resulting in the final payment date of the Receivable being later than the Collection Period immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the latest maturing Class of Notes, (ii) cancels a Receivable or reduces or waives (including with respect to any Upgrade Offer) the remaining Principal Balance under a Receivable or any portion thereof and/or as a result, the monthly payments due thereunder, or (iii) modifies, supplements, amends or revises a Receivable to grant the Obligor under such Receivable a contractual right to upgrade the related Device, it will acquire the affected Receivable solely as described under Section 3.3, unless it is required to take the action by Law.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"unless it is required to take the action by Law\" to \"even if it is required to take the action by Law\", the modification creates a contradiction. This section initially allows the servicer to avoid acquiring the Receivable if required to take the action by law. The change now enforces acquisition regardless of legal requirements.",

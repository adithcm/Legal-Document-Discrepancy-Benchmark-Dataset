Licensee can exclude maintenance, support and other services.",
                "explanation": "By adding that the Licensee 'deems appropriate' and approves 'sources,' while giving Licensee the ability to exclude revenue streams, conflicts with how Gross Revenues are defined, as any interference from the Licensee would not match the accurate gross revenue count. This could be a violation of accounting laws/practices depending on where the business is operating.",

                "explanation": "Removing that the policy and terms have to be 'reasonably acceptable to Licensor' gives the licensee the ability to have terms that directly violate the license agreement. For example, the privacy policy can allow personal information to be sold, which opens up legal issues. Similarly, the Terms of Use could permit uses of the Licensed Content that violate the copyright of the Licensor.",

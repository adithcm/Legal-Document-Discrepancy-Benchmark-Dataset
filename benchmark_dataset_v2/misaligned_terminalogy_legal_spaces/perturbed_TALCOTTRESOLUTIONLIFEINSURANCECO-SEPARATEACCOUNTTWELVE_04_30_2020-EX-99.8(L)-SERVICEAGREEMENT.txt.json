                "original_text": "Administrator agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Trust's administrators, investment adviser, and transfer agent, and each of their directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents and each person, if any, who controls them within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses to which an indemnitee may become subject insofar as those losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any orders that are not timely transmitted by Administrator in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement or any trades that are cancelled",
                "changed_text": "Administrator agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Trust's administrators, investment adviser, and transfer agent, and each of their directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents and each person, if any, who controls them against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses to which an indemnitee may become subject insofar as those losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any orders that are not timely transmitted by Administrator in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement or any trades that are cancelled",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\")', the scope of indemnification is broadened beyond the clearly defined limits established by securities law, creating uncertainty and potential unenforceability. The reference to the Securities Act provides a specific legal framework for determining who qualifies as a 'controlling person'. Removing it introduces ambiguity, as the term 'controls' can now be interpreted more broadly and vaguely.",

                "changed_text": "The Trust represents that each Fund (a) is currently qualified as an investment company; (b) will maintain its status as an investment company; and (c) will notify the Administrator when it stops being considered an investment company.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to being a 'Regulated Investment Company under Subchapter M of the Code,' which has a very specific legal definition with tax implications, and replacing it with just 'investment company' and removing 'every effort' to 'maintain such qualification', the term becomes ambiguous. This creates a contradiction, as Regulated Investment Companies have specific obligations under the tax code, and this change makes it less clear if those obligations are legally binding. This could lead to confusion and potential disputes about the Fund's actual tax status and its impact on the contracts.",

                "changed_text": "\"Business Day\" shall mean any day the Fund calculates its net asset value.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement that the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and 'pursuant to the rules of the SEC', the definition of 'Business Day' becomes more ambiguous. This change is significant because the rules of the SEC impose specific guidelines for calculating net asset value and the operation of the New York Stock Exchange. This makes it unclear how 'net asset value' is calculated or if the New York Stock Exchange needs to be open for it to be a 'business day.'",

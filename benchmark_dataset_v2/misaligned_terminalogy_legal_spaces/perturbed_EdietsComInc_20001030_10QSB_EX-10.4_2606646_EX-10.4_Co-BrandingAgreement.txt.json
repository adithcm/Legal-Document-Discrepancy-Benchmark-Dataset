For purposes of this Agreement, \"Women.com Competitive Company\" means any company that Women.com reasonably presents as, and eDiets reasonably agrees is, a direct competitor to Women.com by providing an on-line portal for women, including, but not limited to, Oxygen Media and iVillage,",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"Women.com Competitive Company\" means any company that Women.com deems, but eDiets may or may not agree, is a potential source of revenue loss to Women.com by providing any digital service, including, but not limited to, Oxygen Media and iVillage,",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Women.com Competitive Company\" required mutual agreement between Women.com and eDiets. The modified definition allows Women.com to unilaterally define a competitor based on potential revenue loss, irrespective of eDiets' agreement. This conflicts with standard interpretation of 'competitive company' which relies on objective criteria such as similar services offered, not subjective revenue concerns. The modified language makes the exclusivity clause overly broad and potentially unenforceable.",

Women.com reserves the right to update its privacy documentation. eDiets may disclose or otherwise transfer to any person or entity some Women.com Data that in the aggregate summarizes the habits of the Women.com users, but not to exceed 5% of the total number of users per annum.",
                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibited eDiets from disclosing any Women.com Data identifying user identity, habits, or transactions. The modified version permits eDiets to disclose aggregated data summarizing user habits, up to a limit. This contradicts the initial intent of protecting user privacy and creates ambiguity regarding what constitutes 'reasonable care' and what specific aggregated data can be shared. This violates established norms of user data privacy as defined in common privacy laws and policies.",

Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) such party believes it has the full corporate right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform the acts required of it hereunder, (b) the execution of this Agreement by such party, and the performance by such party of its obligations and duties hereunder, will probably not violate any agreement to which such party is a party or by which it is bound, (c) when executed and delivered by such party, this Agreement could constitute an obligation of such party and (d) such party will attempt to perform its obligations hereunder in general compliance with applicable law and regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provided clear warranties about the authority, legality, and enforceability of the agreement. The modified version introduces uncertainty by replacing definitive statements with subjective terms like 'believes,' 'probably not,' 'could constitute,' and 'attempt to perform.' This weakens the warranties, making it difficult to hold a party accountable for breaches and undermining the entire legal foundation of the contract. The modified text now lacks firm guarantees, which contradicts the reasonable expectation in contract law for clear and binding representations.",

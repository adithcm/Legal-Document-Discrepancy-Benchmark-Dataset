                "explanation": "Changing 'limited, non-exclusive right' to 'comprehensive, unrestricted right' creates a conflict. The term 'unrestricted' is ambiguous and legally contradicts the subsequent limitations outlined in the contract, especially regarding territories and specific products. This change could be interpreted differently in court, leading to disputes over the scope of the license.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensee shall pay' to 'Licensee may, at its discretion, pay' makes the royalty payment optional and introduces a condition ('contingent on Licensee's profitability'). This directly contradicts the fundamental nature of a royalty agreement, which mandates payment for usage rights. By making it discretionary and adding a profitability contingency, the enforceability of the royalty clause is severely undermined.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'expressly amended' to 'vaguely amended' and 'necessary implication' to 'potential implication' introduces ambiguity and uncertainty about which parts of the original agreement remain valid. Adding 'contingent on market conditions' creates further ambiguity. These terms are less precise than the standard legal terms used, and creates uncertainty about which parts of the original agreement remain valid. This uncertainty undermines the entire amendment and conflicts with principles of contract law regarding clarity and enforceability.",

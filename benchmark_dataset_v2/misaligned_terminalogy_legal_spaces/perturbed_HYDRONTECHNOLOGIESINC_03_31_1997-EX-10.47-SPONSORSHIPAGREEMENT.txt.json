                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Sunscreen/Skin Care Category\" means the product category consisting of sunscreen, sun protection and similar skin care products.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Sunscreen/Skin Care Category\" means any product that Hydron Technologies, Inc. chooses to market under that name, regardless of its actual ingredients or intended use.",
                "explanation": "This modification broadens the definition of \"Sunscreen/Skin Care Category\" beyond its commonly understood or regulated meaning. This conflicts with consumer protection laws that require accurate product labeling and advertising.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event that the consideration is not paid by Hydron on or before the applicable payment due date, said failure to pay shall be considered a material breach by Hydron, and the Dolphins may elect to charge Hydron a late fee of 1.5% per month of the payment then due and owing until it is paid in full.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that the consideration is not paid by Hydron on or before the applicable payment due date, said failure to pay shall be considered a non-material breach unless the Dolphins deem it otherwise, and the Dolphins may elect to charge Hydron a late fee as the Dolphins feel appropriate.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'material breach' to a condition where it depends on Dolphins discretion, undermines the legal definition of material breach, which is a significant failure to perform a contract's obligations. By further stating the Dolphins may elect to charge a late fee 'as the Dolphins feel appropriate', removes the late fee of 1.5% and causes a legal contradiction that could undermine enforcement.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding material breach and usury laws if the 'appropriate' late fee exceeds legal limits.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each of the parties shall indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective partners, shareholders, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\") from and against any and all claims, orders, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of the other party's negligent actions or omissions with respect to this Agreement, or such party's wilful misconduct or breach of any representation, warranty or agreement in this Agreement applicable to it.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the parties may indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective partners, shareholders, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\") from and against any claims, orders, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, excluding attorney's fees, arising out of the other party's extremely negligent actions or omissions with respect to this Agreement, or such party's breach of any representation, warranty or agreement in this Agreement applicable to it, at the discretion of the indemnifying party.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall indemnify' to 'may indemnify' creates uncertainty about the obligation to indemnify. Adding 'extremely negligent' increases the threshold, and excluding attorney's fees removes a standard component of indemnification. Including at the discretion of the indemnifying party introduces subjectivity. These changes contradict basic indemnification principles, which require a clear and predictable obligation to protect against specific losses. It also removes the use of reasonable attorney's fees which a judge can determine if they are too high, and opens the door to high attorney's fees.",

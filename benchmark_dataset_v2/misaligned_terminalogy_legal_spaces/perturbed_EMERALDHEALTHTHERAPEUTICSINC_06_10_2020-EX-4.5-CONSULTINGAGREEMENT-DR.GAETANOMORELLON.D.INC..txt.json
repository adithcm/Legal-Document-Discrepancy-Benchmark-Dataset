                "original_text": "The Company may terminate this Agreement and the Contractor's engagement for Cause at any time on written notice to the Contractor. The date of termination will be the date specified in the written notice and may be, in the sole discretion of the Company, the same day the notice is given to the Contractor, or such later date as the Company may decide.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may terminate this Agreement and the Contractor's engagement for Cause at any time on verbal notice to the Contractor. The date of termination will be at the discretion of the Company, but must be reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for termination for 'Cause' with written notice. Modifying it to allow 'verbal notice' contradicts the requirement of written notice, creating uncertainty and potential disputes. The term 'reasonable' is also extremely ambiguous, which means the state of British Columbia has protections in place for written notice.",

                "original_text": "“Confidential Information” means information disclosed to the Contractor as a consequence of or through its, his or her position as a director, officer, employee or consultant of Emerald, which information is not generally known in the industry in which Emerald operates. All Confidential Information will, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five years thereafter, be held by the Contractor in a fiduciary capacity for Emerald, in the strictest confidence, and will be used by the Contractor solely for the benefit of Emerald, and will not be used by the Contractor, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than for the benefit of Emerald, nor will the Contractor divulge or communicate, directly or indirectly, such verbally, in writing or otherwise to any party.",
                "changed_text": "“Confidential Information” means information disclosed to the Contractor. All Information will be held by the Contractor but can be used to assist with finding other employment within the same industry, during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter, or be held by the Contractor without any obligation of confidence to Emerald.",
                "explanation": "This alteration significantly weakens the confidentiality clause. By defining 'Confidential Information' broadly and then stating the contractor can use such information to find other employment or holds it with no obligation to Emerald, it contradicts the original intent of keeping the information confidential and in a fiduciary capacity, creating a legal contradiction in the agreement. British Columbia has regulations in place to determine Confidential Information, so this does not align with provincial regulations.",

                "original_text": "The Contractor will devote sufficient time and attention to the business and affairs of Emerald to provide the Services, use his or her best efforts to promote the interests of Emerald, and will carry out his or her Services honestly, in good faith and in the best interests of Emerald.",
                "changed_text": "The Contractor will devote what he or she considers sufficient time and attention to the business and affairs of Emerald to provide the Services, use his or her best efforts when available to promote the interests of Emerald, and will carry out his or her Services in what they consider good faith.",
                "explanation": "By allowing the contractor to determine what is 'sufficient time', 'when available', and what constitutes 'good faith', the clause becomes subjective and unenforceable. This contradicts the original clause, where the Company had a reasonable expectation of the Contractor's time commitment and actions. This would not be protected under any laws in British Columbia.",

                "original_text": "Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by any other Retail Music Store. \"Retail Music Store\" shall mean any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music Products at retail to consumers. \"Music Products\"     2                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n              shall mean pre-recorded music hard goods, digitally                  distributed music (except live and/or cybercast events), music                  books (to the extent this Agreement does not conflict with                  Excite's existing agreement with Amazon.com), music-related                  t-shirts and apparel, and music videos (except live and/or                  cybercast events).",

Excite will not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by any other Retail Music Store. \"Retail Music Store\" shall mean any entity which Excite deems to be a music retailer. \"Music Products\"     2                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n              shall mean select music-related items.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Retail Music Store' is changed from a specific, objective criterion (primarily engaged in the sale of Music Products at retail to consumers) to a subjective one (any entity which Excite deems to be a music retailer). This creates ambiguity and allows Excite to arbitrarily exclude entities from the exclusivity agreement. The definition of 'Music Products' is also drastically reduced, contradicting the original intent and potentially impacting Sponsor's exclusive rights.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts standard intellectual property law. By stating Excite retains all rights *excluding* copyrights, etc., the contract creates a situation where the ownership of the most valuable assets of the website and network is unclear or intentionally omitted, potentially invalidating the ownership clause and leading to legal disputes.",

                "explanation": "By removing the condition that information entering the public domain must do so \"without breach of this Agreement\", the modified clause allows a party to disclose confidential information, then claim it's no longer confidential because it's now in the public domain. This directly undermines the purpose of the confidentiality clause.",

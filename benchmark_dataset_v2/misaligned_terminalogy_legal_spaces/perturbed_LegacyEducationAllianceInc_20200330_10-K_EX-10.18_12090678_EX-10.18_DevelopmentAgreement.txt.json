                "original_text": "1.2. The term \"Affiliate\" means an entity controlling, controlled, or under common control with a party. For these purposes, \"control\" means: (a) the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct the management or policies of an entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; or (b) the ownership, directly or indirectly, of at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities or other ownership interest of an entity.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. The term \"Affiliate\" means an entity somehow related to either party. For these purposes, \"control\" means: (a) the possession, directly or indirectly, of the ability to influence the decisions of an entity, whether through friendship, contract or otherwise; or (b) the ownership, directly or indirectly, of at least ten percent (10%) of the voting securities or other ownership interest of an entity.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Affiliate\" and \"control\" are modified to be less specific and quantifiable. The original contract aligns with the standard legal definition involving specific ownership percentages. The modified version uses vague terms like \"somehow related\" and \"ability to influence\", and lowers the control percentage. This introduces ambiguity and could lead to disputes over who qualifies as an affiliate, impacting liability and responsibility under the contract. The modification contradicts established legal understanding of corporate control.",

The term \"Confidential Information\" means any and all information which is not readily ascertainable by proper means and which derives economic value, actual or potential from not being generally known and which has been the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.",
                "changed_text": "1.4. The term \"Confidential Information\" means some information that a party deems to be confidential. All information relating to the products or operations of a party, which is provided to the other party, or to which the other party otherwise obtains access, pursuant to, or as a result of, this Agreement will be treated as Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition broadens the scope of \"Confidential Information\" significantly by removing the requirements that the information must not be readily ascertainable and must derive economic value. It also eliminates the need for reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy. This means almost any information can be deemed confidential at a party's discretion, regardless of its actual sensitivity. This misaligns with the established legal definition of trade secrets and confidential information, which requires a degree of secrecy and economic value.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, LEA shall defend, hold harmless and indemnify T&B and T&B's agents and employees from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, disputes, causes of action or damages, including, without limitation, FTC actions or other regulatory actions, and/or attorneys' fees arising out of or relating to the promotion, distribution and/or sale of any financial education programs, products or services, including (but not limited to) live presentations, print advertising, radio advertising, direct mail, outbound calls, email marketing, affiliate marketing, online advertising, infomercials and other marketing methods, by or through LEA, In any instance to which such indemnities pertain, LEA shall obtain and maintain necessary insurance, including, without limitation, Commercial General Liability Insurance, including product liability insurance, trademark infringement, copyright infringement, defamation, contractual liability and personal and advertising injury liability insurance in an amount no less than ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) per occurrence and ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) aggregate combined single limit. T&B and Tarek El Moussa shall be named as an additional insured on such insurance and proof of such inclusion shall be provided to T&B.",

In any instance to which such indemnities pertain, LEA shall obtain and maintain insurance. T&B and Tarek El Moussa will attempt to be named as an additional insured on such insurance and proof of such inclusion will be attempted to be provided to T&B.",
                "explanation": "The language is changed from mandatory to optional and less defined, replacing \"shall\" with permissive terms like \"may consider to\" and \"aim to\". The clear insurance requirement is weakened by omitting liability thresholds and making the effort to include T&B as an insured discretionary. This contradicts the principles of indemnification, which mandate clear obligations to protect a party from specific liabilities. This weakens the indemnification clause, making it difficult to enforce. Indemnification clauses are meant to provide security and clarity in financial responsibility. This change undermines this.",

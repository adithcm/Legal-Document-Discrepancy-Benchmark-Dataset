                "original_text": "All notices, requests, demands, payments and other  communications which are required or may be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally, telecopied or sent by nationally recognized overnight carrier, or mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, as follows:",
                "changed_text": "All notices, requests, demands, payments and other communications which are required or may be given under this Agreement shall be deemed adequately served if sent by any means reasonably expected to reach the recipient, including electronic mail, facsimile, or postal service. Formal service requiring specific methods is not required unless explicitly requested by the receiving party.",
                "explanation": "This change broadens the acceptable methods of delivering notices and removes the requirement for specific methods such as certified mail with return receipt. This contradicts standard legal definitions of 'notice' and 'service' which often require specific methods to ensure proof of delivery and receipt, creating uncertainty in the enforcement of notice provisions.",

                "original_text": "For the Initial Term of this Agreement, iVillage agrees that Ford shall be the exclusive automobile manufacturer sponsor and advertiser throughout the Network, with respect to entities whose primary business is that of an automotive manufacturer and/or retailer. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"retailer\" shall refer to an entity which sells new and/or used vehicles.",
                "changed_text": "For the Initial Term of this Agreement, iVillage agrees that Ford shall be the sole automobile manufacturer sponsor and advertiser throughout the Network. For purposes of this Agreement, the term 'retailer' may include any entity that facilitates the sale or distribution of automotive-related products or services, at iVillage's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modification to the definition of 'retailer' introduces ambiguity. The original definition was clear about selling new/used vehicles. By making it discretionary and including automotive-related products/services, iVillage could argue that entities offering car insurance, parts, or even online car review sites are 'retailers,' thus diluting Ford's exclusivity. This contradicts the understood meaning of 'retailer' in the automotive industry.",

                "original_text": "Confidential Information is defined as any, information, communication or data, in any form, including, but not limited to oral, written, graphic or electromagnetic forms, models or samples, which the disclosing Party desires to protect against unrestricted disclosure or use, including without limitation, business information, financial data and marketing data. All Confidential Information shall remain the sole property, of the disclosing Party and its confidentiality shall be maintained and protected by the receiving Party with the same degree of care as the receiving Party uses for its own confidential and proprietary information and the receiving Party shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party.",
                "changed_text": "Confidential Information includes any information, communication or data in any form. The Receiving Party shall make reasonable efforts to keep all proprietary information confidential. However, the receiving Party bears no responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality of any materials shared during the term of the agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the confidentiality obligations. The original text clearly defines 'Confidential Information' and imposes a duty of care. The modified version removes the standard of care, and specifies no responsibility for maintaining confidentiality. This contradicts the common law definition of 'confidentiality' in contracts, creating a loophole where the Receiving Party is free to disclose information.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 30 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific -3- clinical trial program, which shall have the function of coordinating the technical and administrative activities to be undertaken in the framework of this JV.",
                "changed_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, at its convenience, an Advisory Group, with members selected at their discretion, to oversee certain operational aspects of each clinical trial program. This group's role is purely advisory and lacks decision-making authority.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a 'Technical Committee' with specific responsibilities. The modification replaces it with an 'Advisory Group' that has no decision-making authority, contradicting the implicit requirement for technical oversight and coordination. The change introduces ambiguity and reduces the legally binding nature of the oversight mechanism.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and unambiguous terms.",

                "original_text": "Each Party is the owner of the Industrial and Intellectual Property Rights relating to its own: a. \"Background\": All knowledge, information and intangible assets protected under national Law System and international intellectual and industrial property laws and regulations, created or otherwise obtained by a Party prior to the begin of the activity covered by this Agreement. b. \"Sideground\": All knowledge, information and intangible property protected under national Law System and international intellectual and industrial property laws and regulations made or otherwise obtained by a Party during the term of this Agreement but not in the execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party retains ownership of its: a. 'Prior Knowledge': Information possessed before this venture. b. 'Related Information': Data acquired during the venture period.",
                "explanation": "The original definitions of 'Background' and 'Sideground' refer explicitly to 'Industrial and Intellectual Property Rights' protected under law. The modified terms, 'Prior Knowledge' and 'Related Information', lack this explicit legal connection, weakening the protection of intellectual property. The terms are more ambiguous, potentially allowing a party to claim ownership of IP that should fall under the joint venture's scope, thus creating legal uncertainty about intellectual property ownership and rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Intellectual property law principles regarding ownership and protection of pre-existing and newly developed intellectual property.",

                "original_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. Any such arbitration shall (i) be subject to the application of the Italian Law, (ii) take place in Paris, France and (iii) be conducted in English.",
                "changed_text": "All disputes related to this Agreement will be addressed through mediation, with the location and governing law determined by the mediator.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration under ICC rules with specific stipulations on governing law, location, and language. The modified clause replaces arbitration with mediation and gives the mediator the power to determine the location and governing law. This contradicts the explicit agreement on dispute resolution and introduces uncertainty about the legal framework applicable to disputes, which could render the dispute resolution mechanism unenforceable.",

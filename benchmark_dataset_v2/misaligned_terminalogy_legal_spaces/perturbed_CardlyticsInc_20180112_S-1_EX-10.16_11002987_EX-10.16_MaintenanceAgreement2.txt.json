                "original_text": "This Customization Schedule is attached to the Software License, Customization and Maintenance Agreement (the \"Agreement\") executed by and between Bank of America, N.A. (\"Bank of America\") and <<enter Company Name>> (\"Supplier\"). The Customizations identified hereunder shall be subject to the terms and conditions of that Software License, Customization and Maintenance Agreement referenced above.",

The Modifications identified hereunder shall be subject to the terms and conditions of that Software License, Modification and Maintenance Agreement referenced above.",
                "explanation": "Changing “Customization” to “Modification” introduces a misaligned term. While seemingly synonymous, “Customization” in software contracts often carries specific legal and technical implications related to bespoke development. “Modification” is broader and lacks this defined scope, potentially causing disputes over the nature and extent of the work agreed upon. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as the term 'modification' isn't as precise under contract law related to software development.",

                "changed_text": "Bank of America wishes to obtain the Improvements herein defined, and Supplier wishes to deliver those Improvements, on the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this Modification Schedule.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Customizations' with 'Improvements' creates ambiguity. In software agreements, 'Customizations' typically refer to bespoke alterations with defined functionalities. 'Improvements' is a more general term, which may or may not encompass the specific technical implementations originally intended by both parties. This introduces a legal contradiction, blurring the scope of work and potentially nullifying the contract's original intent. 'Improvements' is too open ended and vague.",

                "explanation": "Switching from 'Customizations' to 'Enhancements' and changing 'all' to 'some' creates significant uncertainty. 'Enhancements' is less definitive than 'Customizations,' and limiting the specifications to 'some' instead of 'all' directly contradicts the presumed intention of a software agreement, which typically aims for full functionality. The word 'some' introduces legal ambiguity in the contract about performance expectations.",

                "original_text": "The term \"Affiliate\" as used herein with respect to a party means any partnership, joint venture, corporation of other form of enterprise that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such entity or person. For purposes hereof, \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "The term \"Affiliate\" as used herein with respect to a party means any partnership, joint venture, corporation of other form of enterprise that directly or indirectly influences, is influenced by or is under common influence with such entity or person. For purposes hereof, \"control\" means the suggestion, directly or indirectly, of the power to guide the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through informal agreements, by contract or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'controls' to 'influences' and 'power to direct' to 'suggestion to guide'. Under corporate law, 'control' has specific legal meanings related to voting rights or management authority. The term 'influence' is much vaguer, creating ambiguity as to what constitutes an affiliate. This change deviates from the standard legal definition of 'control' and 'affiliate' making enforcement difficult.",

                "original_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means all information in relation to this Agreement in whatever form that is disclosed by the Parties to each other and shall include without limitation information disclosed orally or in writing or in any other form, tangible or intangible, and whether furnished prior to, on or after the date of this Agreement, that is described as or provided under circumstances that would reasonably indicate that it is confidential, proprietary or a trade secret, including, but not limited to, information relating to Leclanché's technology, intellectual property, financial or business plans, affairs, methodologies, financial statements or projections, internal management tools and systems, products and product development plans, released or unreleased hardware or software products, sales and marketing plans and materials, clients, contacts and contracts, all files, books, records, documents, specifications, schematics, employee suggestions, papers, drawings, models, sketches of any kind or description, including electronic data recorded or retrieved by any means now in existence or at any time hereinafter developed.",
                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means some information in relation to this Agreement disclosed by the Parties to each other and shall include information disclosed orally. This includes information described as confidential or proprietary, relating to Leclanché's technology or intellectual property.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'all information' to 'some information,' and removing the extensive list of what is covered as confidential, the scope of confidentiality is drastically reduced and becomes ambiguous. The deletion of specifics (financial data, business plans etc.) introduces a legal contradiction because trade secret laws define specific types of information that must be protected. This modification directly contradicts the broad protections usually afforded to confidential business information under both Swiss and US law.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties are independent companies, and neither of them or anyone employed by them shall be deemed to be the employee, representative, or legal agent of the other.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"agent\" to \"representative\", the contract introduces ambiguity. The legal definition of 'agent' carries specific obligations and liabilities, including the power to bind the principal. 'Representative' is a broader term with less defined legal implications. This change alters the legal relationship between the parties from an agency relationship, potentially contradicting laws related to agency and contract liability under both Swiss and US law.",

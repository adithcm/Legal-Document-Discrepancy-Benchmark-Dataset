                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Hazardous Materials\" refers to specific legal standards, whereas the modified version broadens it to any 'waste product or substance,' which is far less precise than the definition provided in CERCLA and other environmental statutes. This creates uncertainty about the scope of liability and compliance requirements.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifically references the Internal Revenue Code requirements for REIT qualification. The modified text changes this to a 'general understanding' and 'common business practices' which is inconsistent with the strict rules found in the IRC. This creates uncertainty about whether the Company is actually adhering to the legal requirements for REIT status.",

In contrast, the modified text makes the agent's fee arbitrarily determined by the company's CEO. A fee must be definite and reasonably ascertainable for it to be enforceable, meaning that this clause becomes potentially unenforceable as is.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Adviser shall at all times conform to: (i) all applicable provisions of the Act and any rules and regulations adopted thereunder; (ii) the provisions of the Registration Statement of the Trust under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Act as amended from time to time; (iii) the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws of the Trust; and (iv) any other applicable provisions of state and federal law.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall at all times conform to: (i) its own interpretation of the Act and any rules and regulations adopted thereunder; (ii) the provisions of the Registration Statement of the Trust under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Act as amended from time to time; (iii) the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws of the Trust; and (iv) any other applicable provisions of state and federal law.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces uncertainty by allowing the Adviser to interpret 'the Act' rather than strictly adhering to it. This contradicts the standard interpretation of compliance, where adherence to the law is mandatory, not subject to interpretation. Such a change would make enforcement ambiguous.",

Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by the Adviser for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the Act.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall create and maintain records deemed necessary by its internal policies, pertaining to the various functions performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party pursuant to contract with the Trust. Where applicable, such records will be maintained according to the Adviser’s document retention schedule.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the record-keeping requirements mandated by Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 31a-2. Replacing the legal standard with 'internal policies' and the Adviser's 'document retention schedule' creates a legal contradiction and weakens regulatory oversight. The enforcement becomes uncertain as the records are no longer guaranteed to meet legal standards.",

                "original_text": "The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agent from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from any inaccurate or incomplete statement provided by the Adviser (or its officers, employees, directors and agents) for inclusion in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agents from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from your willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the Adviser's part or the part of the Adviser's officers, employees, directors and agents in the performance of the Adviser's duties under this Agreement, or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the Adviser's obligations and duties under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser's liability shall be limited to the extent permissible by applicable law. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agent from and against liability, losses, claims and damages arising from willful misfeasance definitively proven by a court of law. The Adviser is not responsible for claims arising from unintentional errors or omissions.",
                "explanation": "This modification alters the indemnification clause to limit the Adviser's liability. By adding “to the extent permissible by applicable law”, it opens the door for the adviser to define the limits of the legal liability. Further, redefining the conditions under which indemnification is provided (requiring 'definitively proven willful misfeasance') and excluding liability for 'unintentional errors or omissions' significantly narrows the scope of the Adviser's responsibility, potentially conflicting with fiduciary duties and securities laws that hold advisers accountable for negligence.",

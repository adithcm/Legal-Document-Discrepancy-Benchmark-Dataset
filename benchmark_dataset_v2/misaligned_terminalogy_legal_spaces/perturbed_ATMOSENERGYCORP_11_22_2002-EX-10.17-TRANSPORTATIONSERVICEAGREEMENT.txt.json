                "original_text": "1.1      \"Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO)\" means the maximum                   daily quantity of natural gas, expressed in Dekatherms (Dth),                   that Transporter is obligated to deliver from time to time at                   the Point(s) of Delivery specified in Exhibit B to the                   executed Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.1      \"Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO)\" means the minimum daily quantity of natural gas, expressed in Dekatherms (Dth), that Transporter is obligated to deliver from time to time at the Point(s) of Delivery specified in Exhibit B to the executed Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"maximum\" to \"minimum\" in the definition of MDDO creates a direct contradiction. Natural gas transportation agreements rely on precise quantity definitions, and this change undermines the enforceability of clauses related to delivery obligations, potentially leading to breaches and disputes.",

                "original_text": "1.4      \"Fuel Usage and Applicable Shrinkage\" means the quantity of                   natural gas retained by Transporter for fuel usage, leakage,                   blow-down, minor line pack fluctuations, and lost and                   unaccounted for natural gas.",
                "changed_text": "1.4      \"Fuel Usage and Applicable Shrinkage\" means the quantity of natural gas billed to Shipper, for fuel usage, leakage, blow-down, line pack fluctuations, and lost and unaccounted for natural gas.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"retained by Transporter\" to \"billed to Shipper\" creates a contradiction. Fuel usage is typically the responsibility of the transporter, and by changing this to billing the shipper, it misaligns with standard industry practices and could be challenged under regulatory scrutiny if the rate schedule does not allow for billing this usage back to the shipper.",

This Agreement and the rights and duties of                   Transporter and Shipper hereunder shall be governed by and                   interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of                   Arkansas, without recourse to the law governing conflict of                   laws.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"the laws of the State of Arkansas\" to \"the laws of a state chosen by the Transporter, with recourse to the law governing conflict of laws,\" creates a potential issue. Applicable law is now only state-specific and is dependent on the transporter, which can cause misinterpretation of the original agreement and intent. It can also be challenged, as the shipper and transporter are in Arkansas.",

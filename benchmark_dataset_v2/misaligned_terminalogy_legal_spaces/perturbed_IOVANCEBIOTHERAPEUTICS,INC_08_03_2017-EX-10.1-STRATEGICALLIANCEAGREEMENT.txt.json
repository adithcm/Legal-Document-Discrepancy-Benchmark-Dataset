                "original_text": "(b) \"Invention\" means any idea, invention or discovery, whether or not patented or patentable, that is first conceived, discovered, developed or reduced to practice by a Party in connection with this Agreement, including through MD Anderson's performance of the Research (solely or jointly with others) or that result, to any extent, from use of Confidential Information or the Study article that is the subject of a given Study, including any developments, discoveries, improvements, compositions, know-how, trade secrets, procedures, technical information, data, reports, processes, methods, devices, formulae, protocols, techniques, designs, drawings, methodologies, and biological or chemical material.",
                "changed_text": "(b) \"Invention\" means any novel creation, regardless of patentability, that is documented during the project. This encompasses any improvements or discoveries that are logged, irrespective of their connection to confidential data or study-specific materials. The specific detailed forms of this, such as data or reports, may be excluded by mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with standard legal definitions of \"Invention\" including patentable and non-patentable items. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by limiting inventions to those 'documented' and by creating an option to exclude specific data or reports. This could contradict established patent law, where an invention exists upon conception, not just documentation, and some data can be essential to prove inventorship, making the contract unenforceable regarding intellectual property rights.",

                "changed_text": "MD Anderson hereby grants LBIO a license, details negotiable on a case-by-case basis, under, in and to all Background Intellectual Property. This license is for use during the project term only and applies to any technologies developed independently or jointly during the collaboration, unless stated otherwise in writing. This excludes any third-party intellectual property unless specific arrangements are made for its inclusion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides LBIO a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license with sub-licensing rights to MD Anderson's background IP. The modified text changes this to a license with terms 'negotiable on a case-by-case basis' and limits it to the project term. By removing the 'royalty-free' and 'perpetual' aspects, the license becomes significantly more uncertain, potentially conflicting with typical licensing agreements and expectations in collaborative research. Additionally, specifying 'during the project term only' restricts LBIO's long-term use and exploitation rights after the project concludes, which is contrary to typical licensing agreements for research outcomes.",

                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" covers sensitive project data that is not publicly accessible. It excludes information that is already known to the recipient, independently developed, or disclosed by a third party. Project results will be treated as confidential for one year after project completion, after which they may be disclosed unless otherwise agreed. Standard business practices concerning data handling apply.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' is detailed and aligns with standard legal definitions used to protect proprietary information and trade secrets. The revised definition introduces several legal contradictions and ambiguities. Limiting confidentiality to 'one year after project completion' directly contradicts standard trade secret protection, which can last indefinitely as long as the information remains secret. This is a significant departure from established legal precedent and could make it difficult to enforce confidentiality.  Stating that 'Standard business practices concerning data handling apply' is vague and does not clearly define the obligations of the parties. This creates ambiguity and potential conflict with legal standards that require specific measures to protect trade secrets.",

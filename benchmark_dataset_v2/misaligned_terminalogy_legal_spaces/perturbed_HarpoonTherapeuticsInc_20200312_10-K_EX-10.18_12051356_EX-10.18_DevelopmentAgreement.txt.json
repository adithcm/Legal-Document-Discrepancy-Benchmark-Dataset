                "changed_text": "1.39 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to performing a task such that a company would be required to do anything possible to complete the assigned task.",
                "explanation": "The original text lacks a definition for \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts,\" and by defining it as 'anything possible,' it contradicts the standard legal definition, which typically involves a balancing of costs, benefits, and risks. This creates ambiguity and potential unenforceability, as 'anything possible' is an unreasonably high standard.",

                "original_text": "1.117 \"Patents\" means (a) all national, regional and international patents and patent applications, including provisional patent applications, (b) all patent applications filed either from such patents, patent applications or provisional applications or from an application claiming priority from either of these, including divisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, provisionals, converted provisionals and continued prosecution applications, (c) any and all patents that have issued or in the future issue from the foregoing patent applications ((a) and (b)), including utility models, petty patents and design patents and certificates of invention, (d) any and all extensions or restorations by existing or future extension or restoration mechanisms, including revalidations, reissues, re-examinations and extensions (including any pediatric exclusivity and other such exclusivities that are attached to patents, supplementary protection certificates and the like) of the foregoing patents or patent applications ((a), (b), and (c)), and (e) any similar rights, including so-called pipeline protection or any importation, revalidation, confirmation or introduction patent or registration patent or patent of additions to any of such foregoing patent applications and patents.",
                "changed_text": "1.117 \"Patents\" means all documents submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Patents' is very comprehensive, including various types of patents, applications, and extensions. The altered definition is overly broad and conflicts with the legal meaning of a patent. 'Documents submitted' include filings that are not patents or patent applications. This change introduces a conflict in the enforcement of intellectual property rights and creates uncertainty about what the contract protects.",

                "explanation": "The original text asserts the company is a corporation. The modified language is vague and does not ensure that is a legal entity or that the company has been incorporated. This deviation creates a legal contradiction because it fails to provide assurance about the legal existence and standing of the contracting party.",

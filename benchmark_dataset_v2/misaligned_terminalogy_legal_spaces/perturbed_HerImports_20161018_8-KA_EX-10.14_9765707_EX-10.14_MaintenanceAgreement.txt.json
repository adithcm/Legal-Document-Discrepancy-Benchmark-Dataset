                "original_text": "Subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein, as of the date of this agreement, LEADER maintain the software for an additional five years.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein, as of the date of this agreement, LEADER may maintain the software for an additional five years at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'LEADER maintain' to 'LEADER may maintain at their discretion' introduces ambiguity and contradicts the enforceability of the service agreement. It shifts the obligation to maintain the software from a mandatory duty to a discretionary option, creating uncertainty in contract enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement contains the key understandings among the parties, but does not necessarily supersede all prior agreements, representations and understandings of the parties, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'entire agreement' to 'key understandings' and stating it 'does not necessarily supersede all prior agreements', this clause now contradicts the standard 'entire agreement' or 'integration clause'. This creates uncertainty as to which agreements are actually binding and enforceable, potentially violating contract law principles regarding complete and integrated agreements.",

                "original_text": "Each party will pay its or his own legal fees and other expenses in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the sale of Assets in accordance with this Agreement. However, if any legal action or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because or arising out of an alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and other costs incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it or he may be entitled.",
                "changed_text": "Each party will pay its or his own legal fees and other expenses in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the sale of Assets in accordance with this Agreement. However, if any legal action or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because or arising out of an alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party may be entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs, at the judge's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees' to 'may be entitled to recover attorney's fees, at the judge's discretion' significantly alters the enforceability of the attorney's fees provision. It transforms a guaranteed right to recover fees into a discretionary decision by the judge, which undermines the predictability and enforceability of this clause. In some jurisdictions, there are statutes impacting fee shifting and the change from 'will' to 'may' introduces a contradiction.",

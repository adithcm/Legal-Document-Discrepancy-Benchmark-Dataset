                "original_text": "1.1 Net Investment Income. \"Fund Investment Income\", as defined in paragraph 1.2 below, minus \"Fund Operating Expenses\" as defined  in paragraph 1.3 below equals Net Investment Income. If the Fund's Net Investment Income on any day is below zero, the Investment  Adviser shall waive its Advisory Fee or reimburse the Fund an amount (defined as \"Expense Waiver\") sufficient to produce a Net  Investment Income of zero.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 Net Investment Income. \"Fund Investment Income\", as loosely interpreted in paragraph 1.2 below, less \"Fund Operating Expenses\", as generally understood in paragraph 1.3 below, may be considered as Net Investment Income. If the Fund's Net Investment Income on any day is arguably below zero, the Investment  Adviser might consider waiving its Advisory Fee or perhaps, reimburse the Fund an approximate amount (referred to as \"Possible Reimbursement\") thought to be adequate to potentially yield a Net  Investment Income that is close to zero.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Investment Income' is precise and tied to specific calculations. The modified version introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'as loosely interpreted,' 'as generally understood,' 'may be considered,' 'arguably below zero,' 'might consider,' 'approximate amount,' 'thought to be adequate,' and 'potentially yield.' This creates significant uncertainty, undermining the enforceability of the agreement because the key term 'Net Investment Income' is no longer clearly defined, which contradicts the intent to keep the Fund's Net Investment Income at or above zero.",

                "original_text": "1.5 Right of Recovery. The Investment Adviser shall have the option to recover the full amount waived, paid or reimbursed (the Expense  Waiver) by the Investment Adviser on any day on which the Fund's Net Investment Income exceeds zero. In no event, however, shall  the Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser on any such day unless  the Investment Adviser has expressly exercised its right to recover all or a portion of the Expense Waiver on that day, in which case  such portion of the Expense Waiver elected by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day shall then be due and payable.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 Potential Recovery. The Investment Adviser may, at its sole discretion, perhaps be allowed to reclaim some undefined portion of what it hypothetically waived, paid, or reimbursed (the Probable Reimbursement) by the Investment Adviser on days when the Fund's vaguely-defined Net Investment Income may be slightly above zero. Under no circumstances, however, shall the Probable Reimbursement, or any fuzzy portion thereof, automatically become a required payment from the Fund to the Investment Adviser unless  the Investment Adviser, at its whim, attempts to exercise its right to recover some imprecise fraction of the Probable Reimbursement on that day, in which scenario, a portion of the Probable Reimbursement somewhat arbitrarily chosen by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day might arguably become due and possibly payable.",
                "explanation": "By replacing defined terms with subjective language like 'Potential Recovery', 'sole discretion,' 'perhaps be allowed,' 'undefined portion,' 'hypothetically waived,' 'vaguely-defined,' 'may be slightly above,' 'fuzzy portion,' 'automatically become,' 'at its whim,' 'imprecise fraction,' and 'somewhat arbitrarily chosen,' the modified text introduces substantial ambiguity regarding the Investment Adviser's right to recover waived expenses. This contradicts the original intent of providing a clear right of recovery, making enforcement uncertain. The use of 'might arguably become due and possibly payable' further weakens the obligation.",

                "changed_text": "1.7 Suggested Operating Expense Guideline. Any Possible Reimbursement which the Fund may, at its discretion, offer to the Investment Advisor, should preferably not cause the total overall expenses for the Fund's approximate year of activities to potentially surpass the ballpark figure of maybe 1.25% of the Fund's somewhat averaged net assets.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces the hard limit of '1.25%' with vague language like 'suggested operating expense guideline,' 'at its discretion, offer,' 'total overall expenses,' 'approximate year,' 'potentially surpass,' 'ballpark figure,' 'maybe 1.25%,' and 'somewhat averaged.' This transforms a clear contractual limitation into a discretionary suggestion, contradicting the purpose of setting a firm operating expense limit. This directly undermines the enforceability of the expense limitation and creates uncertainty over financial responsibilities.",

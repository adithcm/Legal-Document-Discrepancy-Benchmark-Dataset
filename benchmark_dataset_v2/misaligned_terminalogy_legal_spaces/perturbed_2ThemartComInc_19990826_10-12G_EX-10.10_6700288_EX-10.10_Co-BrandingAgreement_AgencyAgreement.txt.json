                "changed_text": "(e) \"ESCROW SERVICES\" means services for auction sellers and high bidders where an agent may hold a buyer's money, but is not obligated to hold in trust, until the buyer approves the applicable item; release of funds is at the agent's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This contradicts the standard definition of 'escrow' which legally requires the agent to hold funds in trust. By stating it is not obligated to hold in trust and release of funds is at the agent's discretion, the term is misaligned from its statutory meaning and makes the contract unenforceable as a legitimate escrow agreement under California Escrow Law (California Financial Code Section17000 et seq.)",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
                "changed_text": "6.7  SERVICE STANDARDS. i-Escrow will comply with all laws and regulations; however, i-Escrow's adherence to California Escrow Law (California Financial Code Section17000 et seq., or its successor) is optional and at i-Escrow's discretion. Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the terms of this agreement shall always prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, i-Escrow is not required to notify 2TheMart of any perceived conflict.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the requirement to comply with California Escrow Law, making compliance optional and prioritizing the agreement's terms over legal mandates. The removal of the notification requirement further isolates i-Escrow's actions from legal oversight. This contradicts California Escrow Law (California Financial Code Section17000 et seq.) and creates uncertainty regarding the legal enforceability of escrow-related clauses.",

This advertising fees shall consist of a per Transaction Inquiry amount calculated by multiplying 0.025% by the amount of the average Transaction from all Customers in the preceding quarter. The formula for arriving at the per Transaction Inquiry amount may be revised from time to time during the term of this Agreement to reflect present market conditions (\"the Adjusted Rate\"), but only by mutual\n\nconsent of the parties after good faith discussions. The Adjusted Rate shall be added as an addendum to this Agreement.",

This amount is not tied to Transaction Inquiries or any measurable metric. The formula for arriving at the advertising fee amount may be unilaterally revised by i-Escrow at any time during the term of this Agreement; 2TheMart's consent is not required. Any change to the fee will be communicated at i-Escrow's convenience.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for mutual consent and making the fee amount and criteria solely determined by i-Escrow, the clause contradicts contract law principles requiring consideration and mutual agreement. This creates a scenario where 2TheMart may receive no compensation, rendering the advertising agreement illusory and unenforceable. Basic contract law is being violated.",

                "original_text": "Watchit shall have the exclusive right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content and will have the right to brand the content under the Watchit brand and place a \"bug\" on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark.",
                "changed_text": "Watchit shall have the exclusive right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content and will have the right to brand the content under the Watchit brand and place a \"mark\" on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark.",
                "explanation": "The term \"bug\" in advertising and broadcasting has a specific meaning related to a small, unobtrusive graphic, whereas \"mark\" is a much broader term. By replacing \"bug\" with \"mark\", the contract introduces ambiguity. Trademark law is precise, and this alteration could lead to disputes about the nature and scope of the allowed on-screen identifier. This creates potential uncertainty about the licensee's rights and obligations, especially if the 'mark' is interpreted in a way that infringes on Oceanic Time Warner Cable's broadcast rights or violates advertising standards, because there is not a clear guide.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"entertainment purposes only and does not provide any guarantees of winning or improving your odds of winning\" to \"information purposes only and provide suggestions of winning or improving your odds of winning\" introduces a legal contradiction related to advertising standards and potential liability. The original disclaimer explicitly states no guarantee of winning, which aligns with regulations concerning gambling or similar content. The modified version suggests improvements in winning odds, which may trigger regulations requiring substantiation of such claims and potentially creating liability for misleading advertising. This contradicts the initial intent to avoid any guarantees or warranties related to winning, leading to legal uncertainty under consumer protection laws.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"will provide\" to \"may provide\" introduces a critical legal contradiction regarding the obligation to provide viewership data. The original wording implies a mandatory requirement, which is essential for Watchit to evaluate the effectiveness of their content and advertising sales. The modified wording makes the provision of data discretionary, removing the certainty of receiving this information. This directly impacts Watchit's ability to fulfill its responsibilities, especially regarding advertising revenue and brand promotion. This contradiction affects the enforceability of the agreement, as it undermines the consideration provided to Watchit and introduces uncertainty regarding fundamental performance obligations.",

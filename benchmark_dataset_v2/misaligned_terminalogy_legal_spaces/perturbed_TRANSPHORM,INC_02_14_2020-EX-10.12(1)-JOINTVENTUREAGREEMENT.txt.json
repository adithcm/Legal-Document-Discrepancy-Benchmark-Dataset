                "original_text": "1.13 \"Control\" means the power, right or authority to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a Person, or to elect a majority of the board of directors or similar governing body of a Person, whether through the ownership of securities or similar ownership interest, by contract or otherwise, and references to \"change of control\" include the transfer, disposition or relinquishment, whether directly or indirectly, of Control.",
                "changed_text": "1.13 \"Control\" means the ability to influence, but not necessarily direct, the management or policies of a Person. It does not require the power to elect a majority of the board of directors. References to \"change of control\" include situations where influence is merely altered, not necessarily transferred or relinquished.",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with standard legal interpretations of 'Control', which usually requires the ability to direct management or elect a majority of the board. The modified definition broadens 'Control' to include mere 'influence', which is significantly weaker and creates ambiguity. This contradicts established legal precedents that require a more substantial level of authority for control.",

                "original_text": "1.11 \"Change of Control Transaction\" means either (a) the acquisition of the Company by an entity not affiliated with FSL or TPH by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any stock acquisition, merger, demerger or share exchange but excluding any sale of stock for capital raising purposes) other than a transaction or series of related transactions in which the holders of the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such transaction or series of related transactions retain, immediately after such transaction or series of related transactions, as a result of shares in the Company held by such holders prior to such transaction or series of related transactions, at least a majority of the total voting power represented by the outstanding voting securities of the Company or such other surviving or resulting entity (or if the Company or such other surviving or resulting entity is a wholly-owned Subsidiary (hereinafter defined) immediately following such acquisition, its parent); or (b) a sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole by means of any transaction or series of related transactions with a party other than FSL or its Affiliates or TPH or its Affiliates, except where such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition is to a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "1.11 \"Change of Control Transaction\" means any instance where there are new shareholders or directors in the company, regardless of the percentage of equity or control they obtain. This includes routine appointments and minor equity adjustments, which may or may not alter the actual management or control dynamics of the company.",
                "explanation": "The original 'Change of Control Transaction' definition is specific and tied to significant acquisitions or asset dispositions altering the controlling entity. The altered definition now encompasses even minor changes in shareholders or directors, regardless of materiality. This is a contradiction because it turns a legally significant threshold into an everyday event, leading to potential breaches of contract for trivial matters.",

                "changed_text": "1.29 \"Joint Venture\" means a loose collaboration between the parties, with no specific end date and minimal formal structure. The agreement is merely a guideline and not a binding commitment, allowing parties to withdraw at any time without penalty or prior notice.",
                "explanation": "The initial definition establishes a structured and time-bound joint venture. The changed definition portrays it as a non-binding collaboration with no fixed duration or serious commitment. This drastically alters the legal obligations and expectations, directly contradicting the idea of a legally binding agreement.",

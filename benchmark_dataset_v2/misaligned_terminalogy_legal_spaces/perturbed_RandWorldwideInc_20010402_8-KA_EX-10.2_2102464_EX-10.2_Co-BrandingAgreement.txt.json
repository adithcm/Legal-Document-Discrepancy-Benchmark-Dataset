                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate(s)\" shall mean, with respect to any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly, Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with such Person.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate(s)\" shall mean, with respect to any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly, Manages, is Managed by, or is under common Oversight with such Person.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Controls' has a specific legal meaning, particularly in corporate law, related to the power to direct management and policies. Replacing it with 'Manages' and 'Oversight' introduces ambiguity. While management and oversight are related to control, they don't necessarily imply the same level of authority or decision-making power. This weakens the definition and can lead to disputes about which entities qualify as affiliates.",

                "changed_text": "1.17 \"Know-How\" shall mean any information, regardless of its protection under United States or European Union laws of copyright, patent or trade secrets, that may be retained by a party who has had access to information of the other party, including general knowledge.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the generally understood and legally relevant definition of 'Know-How'. By removing the requirement that it *not* be protected by IP laws, it broadens the definition to include things like patented technology, violating established IP law principles. The use of 'general knowledge' also broadens the term too much to where it may be used for any aspect of business operations, which may violate non-compete clauses.",

                "changed_text": "1.26 \"Software\" means any collection of digital information, including potentially computer software programs, data sets, or other digital assets, regardless of the medium or format, or related user and installation documentation.",
                "explanation": "The original definition focuses on computer software programs. The modified version broadens this to 'any collection of digital information', including data sets, effectively blurring the lines. This weakens the definition, making it ambiguous and challenging to enforce. The altered version also does not make mention of the user interface, which is a legally important attribute when determining software infringement.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'User' has been broadened to include individuals who may not actively access the Intuit Sites and also includes users of other websites linked to Intuit Sites, changing the original definition of a user who is directly transported to the Client's Site. It will create ambiguity on who counts as a user, especially regarding data privacy rights and the scope of allowed data usage, creating misaligned terminology.",

Separate and apart from the fees in Subsection 10.1\n      above, Client will pay Intuit a discretionary amount of the Net\n      Transaction Revenues it receives from any customer (\"Transaction Fee\").\n      The amount will be determined solely by Client.\n      Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month, Client will provide\n      a monthly report (the \"Transaction Fee Report\") to Intuit.

                "explanation": "The 'Transaction Fee' calculation is altered to become discretionary, determined solely by the Client. This contradicts the original intention where the fee was tied to a specific number of 'New Customers' and a percentage of 'Net Transaction Revenues'. This creates a legal contradiction because the modified clause implies Intuit has no guaranteed revenue from transactions, making the obligation unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The modification removes the specified jurisdiction (California law and Santa Clara County courts) and replaces it with vague principles of equity and fairness, and it allows Intuit to choose where disputes may be resolved.

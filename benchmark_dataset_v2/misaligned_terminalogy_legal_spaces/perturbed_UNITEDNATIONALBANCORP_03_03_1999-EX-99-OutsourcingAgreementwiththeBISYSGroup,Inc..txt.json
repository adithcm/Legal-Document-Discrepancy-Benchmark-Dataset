Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century.  After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come.\"",
                "changed_text": "\"We are obligated to accept the presumed benefits of this BISYS partnership,\" stated Thomas C. Gregor, chairman and CEO of United National. \"We did an assessment of our information processing requirements for the next century. After considering our options, we decided the supposed flexibility and quality of BISYS’ TOTALPLUS (R) system is suitable now and later.\"",
                "explanation": "The terms 'excited about the opportunities' is changed to 'obligated to accept the presumed benefits', 'partnership' to 'BISYS partnership', 'needs' to 'requirements', 'evaluating a number of different options' to 'considering our options', and 'best serve our needs today and for years to come' to 'suitable now and later', each of which misaligns the meaning of the agreement and could be interpreted in a coercive context where it's not an open contract, but one sided.",

As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National will be  liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services  during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS.",
                "changed_text": "United Financial Services, a third party services provider that United National Bancorp may own with a vague joint venture, could handle some of the Bank's unspecified information services, or not. United National might consider liquidating its position in United Financial Services sometime around 1999 if the transition to BISYS functions properly.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'owns' is changed to 'may own', 'another joint venture partner' to 'a vague joint venture', 'currently handles' to 'could handle some of', 'Bank's information processing services, item processing and deposit services' to 'some of the Bank's unspecified information services', and 'liquidating its interest' to 'might consider liquidating its position', 'during the first half of 1999' to 'sometime around 1999', which all create vagueness and ambiguity, contradicting the implied certainty in the original contract and undermining the commitment to the outsourcing arrangement.",

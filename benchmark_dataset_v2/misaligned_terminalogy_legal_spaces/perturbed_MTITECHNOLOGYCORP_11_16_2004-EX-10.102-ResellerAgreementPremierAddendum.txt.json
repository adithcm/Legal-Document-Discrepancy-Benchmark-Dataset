                "original_text": "2.2 \"END USER CUSTOMER SERVICES\" means the collective reference to warranty and post warranty (maintenance) services, including standard and enhanced warranty services, made available by McDATA and provided directly to End User Customers.",
                "changed_text": "2.2 \"END USER CUSTOMER SERVICES\" means services, including warranty services, made available by McDATA and, at McDATA's discretion, provided directly or indirectly to End User Customers.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the typical understanding and legal definition of 'End User Customer Services,' which generally implies a direct service relationship. By adding 'at McDATA's discretion, provided directly or indirectly,' it creates ambiguity and potential for McDATA to avoid direct service obligations, conflicting with consumer protection norms.",

                "changed_text": "8.1 As used herein, \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" will mean any information designated as such by the disclosing party. The receiving party must treat information labeled as confidential with reasonable care.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION' is extensive and detailed, aligning with common legal interpretations of trade secrets and proprietary data. The modified definition is extremely vague, removing specific protections for categories like trade secrets and customer lists. This conflicts with established legal precedent for protecting sensitive business information and creates uncertainty about what is actually protected under the agreement.",

The changed text effectively removes all warranties, including the express warranties that may be offered with the product. This contradicts consumer protection laws and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which often imply basic guarantees of product quality and functionality, especially in commercial transactions.",

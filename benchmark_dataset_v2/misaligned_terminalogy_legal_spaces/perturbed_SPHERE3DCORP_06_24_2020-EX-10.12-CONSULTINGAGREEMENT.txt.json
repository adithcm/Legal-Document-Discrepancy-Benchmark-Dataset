                "original_text": "It is understood and agreed, and it is the express intention of the parties to this Agreement, that the Consultant is an independent contractor, and not an employee or agent of the Company for any purpose whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "It is understood and agreed, and it is the express intention of the parties to this Agreement, that the Consultant is a worker, and not an employee or agent of the Company for any purpose whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' introduces ambiguity. While the intention is to define the relationship, 'worker' can have different legal meanings under employment laws, blurring the lines and potentially misclassifying the consultant.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal employment laws defining 'independent contractor' versus 'worker'",

                "original_text": "The Consultant (i) has adequate means of providing for the Consultant's current needs and possible personal contingencies; (ii) is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view to their distribution and has no need for liquidity in this investment; (iii) is able to bear the substantial economic risks of an investment in the Shares for an indefinite period; and (iv) is an \"accredited investor\" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant (i) has adequate means of providing for the Consultant's current needs and possible personal contingencies; (ii) is acquiring the Shares for investment and potentially with a view to their distribution; (iii) is able to bear the potential risks of an investment in the Shares for a definite period; and (iv) is an \"investor\" as generally understood.",
                "explanation": "The changed text removes the specific requirements of an 'accredited investor' under Rule 501 of Regulation D, and introduces ambiguity by stating that the consultant is acquiring shares 'potentially with a view to their distribution.' Furthermore, it changes the 'substantial economic risks' and 'indefinite period' to 'potential risks' and a 'definite period', contradicting the regulations for private placement exemptions.",

                "original_text": "This Consulting Agreement shall be governed by, and construed pursuant to the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and performed wholly within such State.",
                "changed_text": "This Consulting Agreement shall be governed by, and construed pursuant to principles of fairness, applicable to agreements.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from the 'laws of the State of New York' to 'principles of fairness' eliminates a clear, legally defined jurisdiction. 'Principles of fairness' is vague and subjective, contradicting the established practice of specifying a governing law for contracts, making it unclear which legal framework should be used to interpret and enforce the agreement.",

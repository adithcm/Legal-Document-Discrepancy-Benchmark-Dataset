                "changed_text": "(vi) \"MANUFACTURING OUTSOURCING SERVICES\" - Broad support activities encompassing some purchasing, partial manufacturing, basic testing, limited configuration, and occasional delivery assistance for the Products as referenced in the Agreement's high-level descriptions. These services might cover minimal component procurement when NICE doesn't supply them, potential product assembly depending on current needs, simple product tests, elementary configuration steps, and helping with sporadic deliveries, all under general NICE guidance. The services also touch on providing limited infrastructure, using some shared equipment, following general change processes, addressing basic packaging, and handling basic logistics, subject to NICE's direction and resource availability.",
                "explanation": "By using vague and non-specific descriptions, the modified definition creates ambiguity and conflicts with the detailed list of responsibilities provided in the original definition. The term 'Manufacturing Outsourcing Services' is meant to create uncertainty about the true scope of the outsourced services.",

Proprietary Information may also include\n           information disclosed to NICE by third parties.",
                "changed_text": "(xi) \"NICE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION\" - Limited information, potentially disclosed by NICE to the Contractor, possibly in written form, loosely related to NICE's general business operations and select products. This might include basic documents and high-level product overviews. Information NICE gets from others might also be considered.",
                "explanation": "The revised definition introduces conflicting interpretations by making the scope of \"NICE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION\" uncertain and limited. This misaligns the term by contradicting the comprehensive protection intended in the original definition.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade Secret Law - Vague definitions of proprietary information make it difficult to claim trade secret protection.",

                "changed_text": "(xii) \"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\" - General branding elements, possibly including trademarks and logos, and some basic designs. Could also cover general know-how.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces legal uncertainty by narrowing the definition of \"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\" to branding elements, while omitting key aspects like 'patents', 'copyrights', and 'trade secrets'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Intellectual Property Law - A limited definition jeopardizes protection by excluding legally recognized forms of intellectual property.",

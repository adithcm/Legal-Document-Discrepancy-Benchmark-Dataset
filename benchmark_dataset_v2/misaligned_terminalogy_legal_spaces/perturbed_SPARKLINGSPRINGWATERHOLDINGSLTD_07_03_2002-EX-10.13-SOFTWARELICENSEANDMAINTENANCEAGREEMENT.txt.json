                "explanation": "This change replaces the term 'fees' with 'consideration', deviating from established contractual terminology and creating a contradiction. The term 'fees' is specifically defined in the contract by 'Fee Schedule' where as 'consideration' is not.",

                "explanation": "This modification replaces 'Specifications' with 'Sparkling's expectations'. 'Specifications' have a documented legal meaning, while expectations are highly subjective and do not comply with standard commercial law requirements for warranties. This removes a clear, legally enforceable standard and replaces it with an ambiguous term.",

                "changed_text": "Garman will reimburse Sparkling for direct expenses.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces comprehensive indemnification with a limited reimbursement clause, deviating from a strong protection to a weak one. The term 'Losses' is being replaced by the less definitive 'direct expenses', creating a legal contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "Territory: means the areas where the Distributor actively markets the Products, subject to Supplier approval.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Territory' refers to a clearly defined area in Schedule 2. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by linking 'Territory' to 'areas where the Distributor actively markets,' which requires 'Supplier approval.' This contradicts the initial explicit definition and creates uncertainty regarding the distributor's rights, potentially conflicting with established contract law principles that favor clear and unambiguous contract terms. This introduces uncertainty that can lead to the contract being seen as not valid.",

                "changed_text": "The Supplier allows the Distributor to promote the Products in mutually agreed upon locations.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'appoints...non-exclusive distributor to distribute...in the Territory' to 'allows...to promote...in mutually agreed upon locations' significantly weakens the Distributor's rights. 'Non-exclusive distributor' carries a legal weight concerning sales rights and obligations, whereas 'allows to promote' is vague and discretionary. This creates a conflict. It transforms a defined distribution agreement into a more flexible marketing arrangement, altering the fundamental nature of the agreement and introducing ambiguity regarding the distributor's actual authority to sell.",

                "changed_text": "Products: Includes the medical products listed in Schedule 1, in addition to items chosen at the Supplier's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies 'any other products developed by the Supplier' with express written notice. The new definition changes this by including items that were 'chosen at the Supplier's discretion,' introducing uncertainty. Changing this modifies which products the distributor has the right to sell, therefore creating misaligned terminology.",

                "changed_text": "Downtime begins upon Customer notification to eGain of the interruption, either\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nby notifying eGain through any means the Customer deems reasonable, and continues until eGain acknowledges the notification.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear method for notifying eGain of downtime (speaking to a representative or leaving a voicemail). The modified text broadens this to \"any means the Customer deems reasonable,\" and shifts the end condition from service restoration to eGain's acknowledgement. This creates ambiguity and contradicts the original, more specific definition, making enforcement uncertain. What constitutes a 'reasonable means' is now open to interpretation. This contradicts generally accepted business practices.",

CUSTOMER AGREES TO PAY FOR HOSTING SERVICES ON OR BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, except that, with respect to Additional Fees (as defined in Exhibit A), eGain will invoice Customer for such Fees in the month after the month in which such fees accrue as provided in Exhibit A.",

CUSTOMER AGREES TO ATTEMPT TO PAY FOR HOSTING SERVICES sometime during the month in which the HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, except that, with respect to Additional Fees (as defined in Exhibit A), eGain will invoice Customer for such Fees whenever eGain deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a firm due date for payment (the first day of the month). The modified text replaces \"pay\" with \"attempt to pay sometime during the month\" introducing ambiguity about the obligation to pay and when it is due. Furthermore the invoice for the additional fees are provided for \"whenever eGain deems appropriate\" contradicting the general standard contract practices of consistent billing cycles. This makes the payment terms vague and creates uncertainty in enforcement. The language 'attempt to pay' does not carry any legal weight and contradicts the intention of creating an obligation to pay.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that all rights, titles, and interests in the Software and the eGain System remain the exclusive property of eGain. The modified text then states the 'eGain system will belong to the user', establishing that the ownership of the system changes once a user uses the software. This change contradicts the initial statement and makes the ownership of the eGain System uncertain. This also contradicts intellectual property law which state clear ownership guidelines for systems and software.",

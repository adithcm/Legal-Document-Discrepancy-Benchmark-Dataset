                "original_text": "\"Trade Secrets\" means all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically or in writing, to the extent that the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret and the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public.",
                "changed_text": "\"Trade Secrets\" means certain data, potentially including financial, business, scientific, technical, economic or engineering information. The designation of specific elements as a trade secret lies at the sole discretion of the disclosing party and will be considered proprietary if labeled as such, irrespective of accessibility to the public or measures taken for secrecy.",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with the standard legal definition of Trade Secrets requiring reasonable measures to maintain secrecy and derive economic value from that secrecy. The modified definition removes the 'reasonable measures' requirement and the economic value derivation, and instead makes the designation of something as a 'trade secret' entirely subjective. This introduces a conflict with established trade secret law, which requires demonstrable efforts to maintain secrecy and demonstrable economic value.",

The Parties acknowledge that through the course of a history of integrated operations Honeywell and the members of the Honeywell Groups have each obtained knowledge of and access to, or otherwise used, certain SpinCo IP, including Patents, Trade Secrets, copyrighted content, proprietary know-how, and other Intellectual Property Rights that are not otherwise governed expressly by the Separation Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or identified expressly in the schedules thereto (collectively, \"SpinCo Shared IP\"). With regard to the SpinCo Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that Honeywell has the freedom to use such SpinCo Shared IP in the future. Hence, as of the Distribution Date, SpinCo hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the SpinCo Group to hereby grant, to Honeywell and the members of the Honeywell Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for \"have made\" purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the SpinCo Shared IP (excluding Trademarks and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the Honeywell Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.",

                "explanation": "The original clause limits the license granted to Honeywell to a 'similar' type, scope and extent as previously used. The modified clause removes 'similar', thus allowing use of *any* type, scope, and extent, conflicting with the intent to limit usage to pre-existing use. This unlimited extension could be interpreted as exceeding the reasonably anticipated scope of a license transfer incident to a corporate separation and potentially infringes upon SpinCo's continued rights to its IP. The words used in this section is 'any' which has broadness scope for usage of such intellectual property.",

SpinCo may, at its discretion, give notice to Honeywell of any actual or threatened, unauthorized use or infringement of the Honeywell IP of which it receives notice. SpinCo has no obligation to report such events.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that SpinCo 'will promptly give notice' of any IP infringement. The modified clause makes the notification discretionary ('may, at its discretion') and explicitly states 'no obligation.' This contradicts the original, creating uncertainty. If SpinCo doesn't report an infringement, Honeywell could argue breach of contract based on the original clause, but SpinCo could counter that the modified clause allows for non-reporting. It undermines the duty of cooperation and potentially allows for infringement to go unchecked, weakening Honeywell's IP protection.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party A, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise incorporated under the laws of the People's Republic of China (the \"PRC\"), which has the right of the intellectual property (including but not limited to Trademark, the Ownership of Consumer Data Base, Software Copyright and License) specified in the Appendix I of this Agreement (the \"intellectual property\").",
                "changed_text": "Party A, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise incorporated under the laws of the People's Republic of China (the \"PRC\"), which may or may not have the right of the intellectual property (including but not limited to Trademark, the Ownership of Consumer Data Base, Software Copyright and License) specified in the Appendix I of this Agreement (the \"intellectual property\").",
                "explanation": "By adding \"may or may not have the right of the intellectual property\", this introduces ambiguity and contradicts the initial assertion that Party A possesses these rights. This undermines the basis of the licensing agreement, as the very ownership of the intellectual property becomes uncertain. Under PRC law, intellectual property rights are clearly defined, and this change introduces a direct contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "The license under this Agreement is considered non-exclusive, and may be assignable and transferable upon verbal agreement between Party A and Party B.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the established understanding of a \"non-exclusive, non-assignable and non-transferable license.\" Under PRC contract law, such a license grants limited rights. This change allows for assignment and transfer based solely on verbal agreement, undermining the written terms and creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party B should pay for All Intellectual Property RMB 1,000,000 per year to Party A as license fee. Party B shall pay the license fee to the account designated by Party A before December 31 each year. Party A has the right to determine whether or not to exempt the Party B's obligation to pay license fee at its discretion.",
                "changed_text": "Party B may pay for the Intellectual Property an undetermined amount per year to Party A as a 'suggested' license fee. Party B shall attempt to pay the license fee to an account convenient for Party B. Party A has the right to determine whether or not to exempt the Party B's obligation to pay license fee at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'should pay' to 'may pay an undetermined amount' creates a conflict, as now payments are not required and the annual licensing fee is left undetermined. This contradicts standard licensing agreements where fees and payment schedules are fixed. This section's intent is also undermined due to the fact that it no longer requires the party to abide by specific terms. The change directly affects how payments of license fees are handled, which can be problematic legally, especially in regards to auditing the license fees payments.",

                "original_text": "Payment of Premiums. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay premiums on the Policy as provided under the Policy. In\n\n\n\n\nthe event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with terms of Section 11, the Company shall not be liable for any premiums owed on the Policy after the date of termination.",
                "changed_text": "Payment of Premiums. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company may choose to pay premiums on the Policy, if able to. In the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with terms of Section 11, the Company shall not be liable for any premiums owed on the Policy after the date of termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text obligates the Company to pay premiums, whereas the modified text makes premium payment discretionary ('may choose to pay, if able'). This contradicts the principle of contractual obligation, where agreed terms must be fulfilled. By making premium payment optional, the change introduces ambiguity and enforceability issues, potentially leading to disputes about the Company's financial responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of a \"Company Oversight\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Oversight by notifying the Company in writing at their earliest convenience after its receipt of notice of a Company Oversight, or if later, within a reasonable time after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Oversight.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Company Default' has been changed to 'Company Oversight', and the notification period has been changed from 'sixty (60) days' to 'at their earliest convenience' and from 'thirty (30) days' to 'a reasonable time'. This weakens the contract's enforceability because 'Company Oversight' is vague compared to 'Company Default,' which would typically have a specific legal definition. Also, 'earliest convenience' and 'reasonable time' are subjective and lack the precision required in contracts, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

In the administration of this Agreement, the Plan Administrator from time to time may employ agents and delegate to them or to others (including executives of the Company) such administrative duties as it sees fit.",

In the administration of this Agreement, the Plan Administrator from time to time may consider employing agents and delegating to them or to others (including executives of the Company) some administrative duties as it sees fit.",
                "explanation": "The original language clearly grants the Plan Administrator authority and responsibility, whereas the modified language introduces uncertainty and optionality. The change from 'shall have the authority' to 'may attempt to' and 'decide or resolve any and all questions' to 'decide or resolve a few questions, possibly including interpretations of the Agreement' reduces the Plan Administrator's accountability and creates ambiguity about the scope of their powers. This hinders the agreement's enforceability and contradicts the intent of establishing a clear administrative structure under ERISA, if applicable.",

The modified definition excludes Siemens' Affiliates, which contradicts the initial broad definition. This creates uncertainty regarding which entities are considered distributors under the agreement, potentially leading to disputes about liability, performance obligations, and rights.",

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation thereof without the express written approval of Accuray.

Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from minor defects and perform reasonably in accordance with the understood Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in common use at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Initial Use of the Products at Customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of the System shall occur at the Customer's discretion. If Accuray does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within thirty (30) days following Initial Use (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). Distributor",
                "explanation": "The modified text changes key aspects of the warranty definition. Changing \"material defects\" to \"minor defects\" reduces the scope of the warranty. Replacing \"written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance\" with \"understood Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in common use\" introduces ambiguity, as 'understood' and 'common use' are subjective and undefined, differing from explicit written specifications approved by regulators. Changing \"Installation\" to \"Initial Use\" and removing the requirement for Accuray's acceptance test means the start of the warranty is now based on when the customer begins using the product, regardless of whether it meets specifications. This weakens Accuray's control over the warranty trigger and increases the risk of disputes over when the warranty period begins and what constitutes a defect.",

                "original_text": "5.4.1. System Purchase Payments. Payment for the purchase of a System shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in US Dollars in the form of either (1) an irrevocable trade finance letter of credit or (2) wire transfer as further described in Sections 5.4.1.1 (Letter of Credit) and 5.4.1.2 (Wire Transfer), respectively below. Accuray shall bear the cost of any bank charges assessed by its bank for a letter of credit and any commission charge for a wire transfer. Past due balances on any reasonably undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in ยง 14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes due.",
                "changed_text": "5.4.1. System Purchase Payments. Payment for the purchase of a System shall be made by Distributor to Accuray in any currency in the form of a negotiable instrument or digital transaction method. Distributor shall bear all costs for any bank charges and any commission charge. Past due balances shall bear interest at a rate determined solely by Accuray. Payment shall be deemed past due at Accuray's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies payments in US Dollars and defines the payment methods as either a letter of credit or wire transfer. The modified version allows payment in any currency and uses vague terms like \"negotiable instrument or digital transaction method\", which introduces uncertainty. It shifts the burden of all bank charges to the distributor, conflicting with the original agreement that Accuray covers its own bank charges. Furthermore, it gives Accuray sole discretion to determine the interest rate for past due balances, removing the cap based on applicable law. The \"reasonably undisputed amount\" phrase is also removed, which can open to vulnerabilities if they occur. The change also removes the clause protecting \"business person\" under the German Civil Code and the point that a payment demand note must be received before payments are considered past due.",

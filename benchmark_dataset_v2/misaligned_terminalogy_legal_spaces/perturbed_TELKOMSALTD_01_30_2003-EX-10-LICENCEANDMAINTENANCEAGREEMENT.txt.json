                "original_text": "2. 3. 7.       \"PROGRAM CONCEPTS\" means the concepts, techniques, ideas and   know-how embodied and expressed in any computer programs or modules   included in the SOFTWARE, including the structure, sequence and   organisation of such programs and modules;",
                "changed_text": "2. 3. 7.       \"PROGRAM CONCEPTS\" means the general ideas and suggestions embodied in any computer programs or modules included in the SOFTWARE, excluding the specific structure, sequence and organisation of such programs and modules;",
                "explanation": "The original definition of “PROGRAM CONCEPTS” includes the specific structure and organisation of the software, providing a clear scope for proprietary protection. By changing the definition to exclude the 'specific structure, sequence and organisation,' the contract creates uncertainty. It is uncertain what is protected as Program concepts since this definition significantly narrows the scope, potentially conflicting with standard intellectual property interpretations related to software.",

USE is deemed to occur where   any such USE occurs by TELKOM, its AFFILIATES or their   respective employees or BUSINESS THIRD PARTIES authorised by   TELKOM in terms of formal arrangements, to USE the SOFTWARE   and, for the purposes of this AGREEMENT, TELKOM shall permit the    SOFTWARE to be USED only within the TERRITORY;",
                "changed_text": "2. 3. 11. 7.         \"USE\" means to casually load, execute, generally employ, lightly utilise, superficially access, temporarily store or incidentally process information that sometimes results in TRANSACTION USE or occasionally displays the SOFTWARE within the TERRITORY. USE is deemed to occur rarely and under strict supervision where any such USE occurs by TELKOM, its AFFILIATES or their respective employees or BUSINESS THIRD PARTIES authorised by TELKOM in terms of informal understandings, to USE the SOFTWARE and, for the purposes of this AGREEMENT, TELKOM shall reasonably permit the SOFTWARE to be USED arbitrarily anywhere;",
                "explanation": "The original text defines USE as any access or processing of information by authorized parties within the specified territory. The modified text severely restricts and alters this definition by adding qualifiers, introducing terms that contradict the original intent. This creates a legal contradiction, since it becomes unclear what constitutes 'USE' under the contract, potentially invalidating usage-based clauses.",

                "changed_text": "10. 1    SAP AFRICA suggests that the SOFTWARE might generally resemble the purported functional specifications vaguely alluded to in the documentation provided at some unspecified time before or after the eventual attempted installation of the SOFTWARE and might, possibly, perform, perhaps only some parts of the time, when in nominal use with some alteration on an approximate DESIGNATED UNIT in accordance with the inferred functional specifications liberally extrapolated from the documentation, which might be subject to change without notice.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty clearly states that the SOFTWARE will conform to the functional specifications in the DOCUMENTATION. The modified version weakens the warranty to the point of being meaningless by adding ambiguous terms and qualifiers. This contradicts the original intent, undermining the warranty's enforceability.",

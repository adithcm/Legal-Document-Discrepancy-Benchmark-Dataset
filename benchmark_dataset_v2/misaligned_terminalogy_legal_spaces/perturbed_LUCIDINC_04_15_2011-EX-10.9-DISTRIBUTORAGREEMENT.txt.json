                "original_text": "B) The relationship of the parties under this Agreement is that of independent contractors and nothing contained herein shall be construed as  creating any partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the Distributor and Lucid. Under no circumstances shall any employees of  one party be deemed the employees of the other for any purpose. The Distributor shall not have the authority to assume or create any obligation,  or make any representation of any kind on behalf of Lucid.",
                "changed_text": "B) The relationship of the parties under this Agreement is that of independent contractors. However, the Distributor is authorized to act as Lucid's agent for specific marketing campaigns as Lucid directs. Under no circumstances shall any employees of one party be deemed the employees of the other for any other purpose. The Distributor shall not have the authority to assume or create any further obligation, or make any representation of any kind on behalf of Lucid, except for the marketing campaigns.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states the Distributor is an independent contractor and not an agent. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating the Distributor is authorized to act as Lucid's agent for specific marketing campaigns. This creates ambiguity as to the Distributor's true status, conflicting with the definition of 'independent contractor' under New York law, which emphasizes autonomy and control.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A) The Distributor is appointed as an exclusive Distributor within the following territories: [*].     B) The Distributor agrees to act as a Distributor for Lucid within the above Territories and not to solicit any sales of the Product(s) outside the  above Territories.",
                "changed_text": "A) The Distributor is appointed as a preferred Distributor within the following territories: [*].     B) The Distributor agrees to act as a Distributor for Lucid and may solicit sales of the Product(s) outside the above Territories, subject to Lucid's approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes an exclusive territory for the distributor. The modified text changes \"exclusive Distributor\" to \"preferred Distributor\" and allows sales outside the territory with Lucid's approval. This contradicts the common understanding and legal definition of 'exclusive distributorship', which implies a sole right to sell within a specified territory. The term \"preferred Distributor\" has no clear legal meaning and allowing sales outside the territory negates exclusivity.",

                "original_text": "A) Lucid does not guarantee delivery of Product by any particular date. If Lucid accepts Distributor's order and fails to deliver ordered products,  Distributors sole remedy will be limited to refund of money paid to Lucid for any undelivered products.",
                "changed_text": "A) Lucid does not guarantee delivery of Product by any particular date. If Lucid accepts Distributor's order and fails to deliver ordered products,  Distributors sole remedy will be limited to a future discount on other products.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear remedy: a refund. The modification replaces the refund with a 'future discount on other products'. This is problematic as the distributor might not wish to order more products. Under New York law (Uniform Commercial Code), a buyer is generally entitled to a refund if a seller fails to deliver goods. Replacing this with a 'future discount' limits the distributor's remedies in a way that may not be commercially reasonable and potentially unenforceable.",

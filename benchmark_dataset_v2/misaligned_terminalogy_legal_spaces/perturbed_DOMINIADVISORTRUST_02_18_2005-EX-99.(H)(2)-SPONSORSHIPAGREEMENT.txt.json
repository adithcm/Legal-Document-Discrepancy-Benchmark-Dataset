                "explanation": "By stating the Trust may or may not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the contract creates a direct contradiction. The original text indicates it IS an investment company, whereas the change introduces uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law, act or omission. The Sponsor's liability extends only to instances of intentional misconduct proven beyond a reasonable doubt.",
                "explanation": "This removes the exceptions for 'willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence' and raises the standard for liability to 'intentional misconduct proven beyond a reasonable doubt.' This contradicts standard fiduciary duty requirements which hold investment sponsors to a standard that includes negligence and bad faith.",

                "explanation": "By stating that the agreement will be governed by principles of equity and fairness, as determined at the sole discretion of the Sponsor, it makes the contract unenforceable. The reference to Massachusetts law is removed and the power to interpret 'equity and fairness' is given to one party. This introduces legal uncertainty and contradicts fundamental contract law principles.",

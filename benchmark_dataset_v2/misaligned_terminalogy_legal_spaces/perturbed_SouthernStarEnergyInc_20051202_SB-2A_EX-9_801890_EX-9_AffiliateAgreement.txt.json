                "original_text": "Instead of fixed compensation, the Affiliate receives result- dependent Advertising Cost Compensation (also known in the element 5 Control Panel as \"Commission\") in exchange for publishing the advertisements. The Advertising Cost Compensation depends on the actual sales generated by end users referred via the electronic advertisement (the Affiliate's link).",
                "changed_text": "Instead of fixed compensation, the Affiliate receives result- dependent Advertising Cost Reimbursement (also known in the element 5 Control Panel as \"Gratuity\") in exchange for publishing the advertisements. The Advertising Cost Reimbursement depends on the discretionary bonuses provided by end users referred via the electronic advertisement (the Affiliate's link).",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines 'Advertising Cost Compensation' as a result-dependent payment based on actual sales. The modified text replaces this with 'Advertising Cost Reimbursement' (also known as 'Gratuity'), stating it depends on discretionary bonuses. This creates a contradiction because 'compensation' implies a contractual obligation, while 'gratuity' suggests voluntary payment. This makes the enforcement of payment terms ambiguous and could be considered as an attempt to evade legal obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - principles of offer, acceptance, and consideration. Changing 'compensation' to 'gratuity' undermines the certainty of the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Reimbursement shall be subject to the Software Publisher's discretion and business performance, without any specific financial ceiling.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear upper limit of 50% for the 'Advertising Cost Compensation'. The modified text removes this limit and introduces the ambiguous 'business performance' criterion, creating a contradiction. This change allows the Software Publisher to arbitrarily adjust the reimbursement percentage, which undermines the Affiliate's ability to predict and rely on their earnings. This shift from a clear percentage limit to discretionary, undefined factors makes the clause unenforceable due to vagueness.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - principles of certainty and definiteness. Removing a clear upper limit and introducing undefined 'business performance' creates ambiguity.",

                "changed_text": "element 5 may consider disbursing advertising assistance (including Vat, if any, subject to element 5's sole discretion) if an end user navigates to the order page. Such assistance is purely voluntary, and element 5 reserves the right to deny or modify the amount based on internal calculations.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'element 5 will pay Affiliate its advertising costs,' indicating a clear obligation based on certain conditions being met. The modified version replaces 'will pay' with 'may consider disbursing advertising assistance', which makes the payment discretionary and removes the obligation. It introduces the phrase 'purely voluntary' and asserts element 5's right to 'deny or modify the amount based on internal calculations,' effectively negating the initial promise of payment. This directly contradicts the establishment of a contract where compensation should be guaranteed upon fulfillment of stated conditions.",

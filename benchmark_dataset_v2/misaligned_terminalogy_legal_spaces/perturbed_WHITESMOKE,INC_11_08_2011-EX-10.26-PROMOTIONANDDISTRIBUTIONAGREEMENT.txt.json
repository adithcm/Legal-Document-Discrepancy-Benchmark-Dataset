                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"End User\" means an end user customer of Distributor who is located in the Territory.\n     \"EULA\" means the end user license agreement applicable to a Product, which end user license agreement may be updated or modified by Google in  its sole discretion from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "\"End User\" means any individual who uses the Distributor App, regardless of their location.\n     \"EULA\" means a set of guidelines for product use, which may be altered based on the distributor's preference.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'End User' broadens the scope beyond the specified territory, potentially conflicting with distribution agreements tied to specific regions. The modified definition of \"EULA\" introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard legal interpretations of end-user license agreements. An EULA is a legally binding agreement, not a mere set of guidelines.",

                "changed_text": "Google can suggest the distribution of newer versions. Distributor may consider these suggestions based on their schedule.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for the distributor to distribute updates within a specified timeframe. The modified version weakens this obligation to a mere suggestion, creating uncertainty about the distributor's responsibility to provide timely updates, impacting Google's ability to maintain consistent product standards and potentially violating agreements related to software maintenance and distribution.",

                "original_text": "All notices of termination or breach must be in English, in writing, addressed to the other party's Legal Department and sent to  Distributor's address set out at the head of this Agreement or to [ * ] (as applicable) or such other address as either party has notified the  other in accordance with this Clause.",
                "changed_text": "All notices of termination or breach can be communicated either verbally or in writing to any representative of the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that formal notifications, such as those concerning contract termination or breaches, must be communicated in English and sent to the other party's legal department. The modified clause broadens acceptable methods of communication and allows for notices to be delivered to any representative rather than the legal department. The change potentially disregards standard legal notification protocols, which require formal, documented communication. This could lead to disputes over whether adequate notice was served, undermining the enforceability of termination or breach provisions under contract law.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "UTEK shall be, and in all respects be deemed to be, an independent contractor in the performance of its duties hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "UTEK shall be referred to as a service provider, but act as an employee of MKOS in the performance of its duties hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This modification reclassifies UTEK from an independent contractor to acting as an employee, creating contradiction. While initially termed as a service provider, the clause asserts UTEK should 'act as an employee'. This contradicts the legal definition of 'independent contractor' under both federal and state labor laws, making the contract ambiguous and potentially non-compliant with employment regulations.",

                "original_text": "VII. CONFIDENTIAL DATA\n\nA. UTEK shall not divulge to others, any trade secret or confidential information, knowledge, or data concerning or pertaining to the business and affairs of MKOS, obtained by UTEK as a result of its engagement hereunder, unless authorized, in writing by MKOS.",
                "changed_text": "VII. CONFIDENTIAL DATA\n\nA. UTEK may, at its discretion, share confidential information, knowledge, or data concerning or pertaining to the business and affairs of MKOS, obtained by UTEK as a result of its engagement hereunder. Written authorization by MKOS is suggested, but not required.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly alters the confidentiality obligations. By stating that UTEK *may* share confidential information and deeming written authorization as 'suggested, but not required,' it directly contradicts the standard legal definition of 'confidentiality' and 'trade secret' protection. This introduces uncertainty and makes the confidentiality clause unenforceable, potentially violating state laws protecting trade secrets.",

                "original_text": "J. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Solely by virtue of their respective execution of this Agreement and in consideration for the mutual covenants of each other, MKOS and UTEK hereby agree, consent and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of any material term of this Agreement, the non-breaching party will be without adequate remedy-at-law and shall therefore, be entitled to immediately redress any material breach of this Agreement by temporary or permanent injunctive or mandatory relief obtained in an action or proceeding instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of proving damages and without prejudice to any other remedies which the non-breaching party may have at law or in equity.",
                "changed_text": "J. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Solely by virtue of their respective execution of this Agreement and in consideration for the mutual covenants of each other, MKOS and UTEK hereby agree that, in the event of a breach of any term of this Agreement, the non-breaching party may seek injunctive relief only if significant monetary damages are proven.",
                "explanation": "This alteration on injunctive relief creates uncertainty. The original clause allows injunctive relief for *any material* breach without proving damages. The modified version restricts this, mandating *significant monetary damages* must be proven. This conflicts with general legal principles allowing injunctive relief for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate, potentially invalidating the clause's enforceability.",

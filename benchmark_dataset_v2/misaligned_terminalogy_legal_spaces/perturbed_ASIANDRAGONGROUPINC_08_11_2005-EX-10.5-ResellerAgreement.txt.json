                "original_text": "Confidential Information\" means all information which one of the Parties will have access to or come into possession of which is confidential and proprietary to the other Party and which is either declared to be confidential or which the receiving Party should know, acting reasonably, is confidential or proprietary in nature and includes, but is not limited to, the terms and pricing for the Products and Services, all information contained on or accessible through the Partner Portal, as defined hereafter, any information disclosed by any third party which the third party is obligated to treat as confidential or proprietary to one of the Parties hereto, trade secrets, know-how, processes, standards, product specifications, marketing plans and techniques, cost and financial pricing figures, all client or customer information (including without limitation their names, financial information, address or telephone number), all systems software applications, all software/systems source and object code, data, documentation, program files, flow charts, and all operational procedures.",
                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means some information which one of the Parties will have access to or come into possession of which is explicitly marked as confidential by the disclosing party. This includes only documents stamped \"Confidential\" and does not include any other information, regardless of its nature.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Confidential Information\" is broad, encompassing information that is either declared confidential or should reasonably be known to be confidential. The modified definition drastically narrows this scope, restricting it only to explicitly marked documents. This contradicts the general legal understanding of confidential information, which often includes implied confidentiality based on the nature of the information and the relationship between the parties, creating uncertainty in enforcement. In British Columbia and under Canadian law, confidential information can arise from the nature of the relationship, which is now contradicted. This affects clause 11 in the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "\"Force Majeure\" shall include only an Act of God, specifically limited to a direct and catastrophic weather event such as a hurricane or earthquake of magnitude 8 or higher, rendering performance impossible.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Force Majeure\" is broad and inclusive of various events beyond a party's control. The modified definition severely restricts it to only specific Acts of God (catastrophic weather events), excluding other potential force majeure events like governmental restrictions, labor disputes, or equipment unavailability. This contradicts the accepted legal interpretation of force majeure clauses, which typically cover a wider range of unforeseeable events that impede performance and introduces ambiguity and contradictions.

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a Tier 1 support function to maintain subscriber satisfaction at or above industry standards, with further details in Schedule B. The modified text removes the specific Tier 1 requirement and reduces the obligation to a vague \"best-effort\" attempt with no guarantees. This contradicts the original, more stringent obligation to provide adequate support and could lead to disputes over whether Telnet is fulfilling its obligations under the agreement. Tier 1 support usually means something specific with service level agreements.",

                "original_text": "Throughout the Term (as defined below), Sponsor shall be the * * * vitamin and supplement sponsor of, and the * * * vitamin and supplement advertiser on, the drkoop.com Website * * *",

                "explanation": "The contract originally defines the length of the agreement as the 'Term,' but this was replaced by 'Period'. This is a key change because the definition of Term found in the contract is rendered irrelevant when a different name is given to the contract's length. This creates uncertainty about the contract's duration, affecting enforcement.",

In the event that an Individual User provides data to Sponsor for its use, Sponsor shall attempt to keep User Data confidential and shall endeavor to only use such data in an ethical manner.",
                "explanation": "The initial phrase 'any and all' was changed to 'some' to lessen the amount of user data to be given to the sponsor, and 'specifically authorized release' was changed to 'generally authorized release'. Also, the phrase 'best efforts' was changed to 'attempt' to create a loophole in which the sponsor doesn't use its best effort to keep User Data confidential, as well as 'endeavor' replacing 'shall' which is not binding.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Confidential Information' was changed to 'Private Information', and the language was changed to 'could mean', 'might be', and 'could include'. This implies that private information is not guaranteed to be confidential under the altered conditions, which is a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the supplier produces raw materials used by PNC. The modified version introduces ambiguity, contradicting the initial premise of a defined supply relationship. This creates uncertainty in enforcing supply obligations and potential disputes regarding the supplier's role.",

                "original_text": "Each Party will hold in strict confidence and keep confidential all Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other. The Parties will use at least the same degree of care to avoid publication or dissemination of such Confidential Information as it uses with respect to similarly confidential information of its own, but in no event less than reasonable care. Use of such Confidential Information by such Party will be strictly limited to activities directly in support of its activities under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will endeavor to keep confidential information private. The Parties will use reasonable effort to avoid publication or dissemination of Confidential Information but do not guarantee total secrecy. Use of Confidential Information by such Party will be primarily for activities related to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'strict confidence' and 'reasonable care', implying a high standard of confidentiality. The modified version weakens this obligation by using terms like 'endeavor', 'reasonable effort', and 'primarily', thereby contradicting the initial intent. This creates uncertainty regarding the level of protection afforded to confidential information, particularly trade secrets, and reduces enforceability against breaches.",

Any Recall occasioned by PNC labels or by tampering with the Ingredients after they have left Supplier's control, or by improper storing or handling by PNC, will not be considered a Defect.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to Section 9.1, the Supplier may be partially responsible for a potential Recall related to the Ingredient quality, and the degree of responsibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Any recall caused by any issue associated with the ingredients at any point in the supply chain shall be subject to negotiations on defect origin.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes clear liability for the Supplier in case of a recall due to a defect in the ingredient. The modified version introduces ambiguity and shifts the responsibility to a 'case-by-case' determination, which is contradictory. This uncertainty undermines the indemnity provisions and could lead to disputes over recall costs and liabilities under product liability laws.",

                "changed_text": "4.2.1 the term \"Agency Fees\" will mean fees that are sometimes suggested by you for potentially issuing a new policy pursuant to the Manual.",
                "explanation": "The change weakens the definition of \"Agency Fees.\" By using phrases like \"sometimes suggested\" and \"potentially issuing\", it undermines the clear definition of what constitutes an agency fee, creating uncertainty in how revenues are calculated and what is owed to the franchisor. This contradicts standard business practices where fees are well-defined and consistently applied.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "4.2.9 the term \"Royalty Fee\" is charged in consideration of you and your Managers' and Producers' use of our business processes, ongoing carrier relationships, trade secrets, know-how, trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, emblems, trade dress, intellectual property, and back office support functions. The Royalty Fee will be the following amounts: (a) the greater of (i) twenty percent (20%) of Gross Revenues on insurance policies in their initial term, or (ii) the Minimum Royalty (defined below); and (b) fifty percent (50%) of Gross Revenues on policies in their renewal terms and policies written for existing customers on the same risk profile within a one-year period of the cancellation of their existing policy (also known as \"re-writes\").",
                "changed_text": "4.2.9 the term \"Royalty Fee\" is perhaps a fee charged with some consideration of you and your Managers' and Producers' access to the potential of using business processes, carrier relationships, and the hypothetical possibility of know-how. The Royalty Fee may or may not be the following amounts: (a) between zero and twenty percent of Gross Revenues on insurance policies in their initial term; and (b) between zero and fifty percent of Gross Revenues on policies in their renewal terms and policies written for existing customers.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity into the calculation and application of royalty fees. The original text specified clear percentages, while the revised text makes the royalty fee discretionary (\"may or may not be\") and provides a broad range of possible percentages (\"between zero and twenty percent\"). This contradicts the established framework for royalty fee calculation and creates legal uncertainty regarding the franchisee's payment obligations, conflicting with standard franchise agreements.",

You agree to establish the Franchised Business and have it open and in operation within six (6) months after the Effective Date of this Agreement. Time is of the essence.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Opening Deadline. You are encouraged to consider purchasing, leasing, or subleasing what you consider to be a site for the Franchised Business. You may, at your leisure, establish the Franchised Business and potentially have it open and in possible operation at some future date. The timeline for this is just a suggestion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the definite deadline for opening the Franchised Business, replacing it with vague and non-committal language. The original text made clear the franchisee's obligation to open within six months, while the revised text frames this as a suggestion and removes the \"time is of the essence\" clause. This contradicts the need for defined timelines in franchise agreements, leading to disputes about expectations and enforcement deadlines, which may violate state franchise laws requiring clear contractual terms.",

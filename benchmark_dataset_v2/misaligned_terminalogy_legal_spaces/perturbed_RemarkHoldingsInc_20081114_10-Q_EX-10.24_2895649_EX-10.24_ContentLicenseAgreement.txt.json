                "original_text": "1.23 \"Open Free Web\" means all websites (i) through which content can be indexed by Google and/or other consumer search engines; (ii) through which content is openly accessible by the public free of charge, and/or (iii) that do not charge a subscription fee or other fee for access to the content of the website.",
                "changed_text": "1.23 \"Open Free Web\" means all websites (i) through which content may or may not be indexed by Google and/or other consumer search engines; (ii) through which content is accessible at the website operator's discretion, and/or (iii) that may charge a subscription fee or other fee for access to specific premium content.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of \"Open Free Web\" contradicts the standard understanding and common usage of the term, particularly regarding accessibility and indexing. By making indexing optional and allowing for subscription fees for 'premium content', it blurs the line between free and paid-access websites, creating uncertainty about the scope of licensed content for the 'Open Free Web'.",

This license is granted for a fixed, unspecified period.",
                "explanation": "By removing the terms 'perpetual' and 'irrevocable' and adding \"This license is granted for a fixed, unspecified period.\", the nature and duration of the license become ambiguous. A license 'for a fixed, unspecified period' is inherently contradictory and unenforceable as it lacks a definite term, which is a fundamental requirement for a valid license agreement.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'the laws of the State of New York' with 'the principles of natural justice, as determined by the arbitrator' introduces a significant legal contradiction. 'Natural justice' is a philosophical concept, not a codified legal system. Giving the arbitrator sole discretion to define and apply these principles creates massive uncertainty and deviates from established legal standards. This undermines the predictability and enforceability of the contract.",

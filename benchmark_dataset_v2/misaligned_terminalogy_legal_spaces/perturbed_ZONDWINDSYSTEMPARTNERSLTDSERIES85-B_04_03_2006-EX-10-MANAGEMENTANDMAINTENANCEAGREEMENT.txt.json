                "original_text": "Manager shall disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the \"LIFO Partners\") in the following circumstances. If at any time, and for any reason other than force majeure affecting the Transmission Line, (i) the Transmission Line is incapable of delivering power at its designed capacity, availability or voltage and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would improve the capability of the transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or (ii) the Transmission Line line losses exceed 1.14%, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Mariah, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Beta Mariah, Beta Mariah (Prime), or Gamma Mariah or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, or (iii) the Transmission Line line losses for either of the power purchase contracts commonly known as Desert Winds I and Desert Winds III exceed the levels experienced immediately prior to the addition of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to the Transmission Line, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Joshua, Alpha Joshua (Prime), Beta Joshua, Beta Willow or Beta Willow (Prime) or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, then the Manager shall curtail the Projects of the LIFO Partners.",
                "changed_text": "Manager may, at its sole discretion, disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the \"LIFO Partners\") in the following circumstances. If at any time, and for any reason, (i) the Transmission Line experiences any disruption, or (ii) the Transmission Line line losses are deemed excessive by the Manager, or (iii) the Transmission Line performance is not satisfactory to the Manager, then the Manager may disconnect the Projects of the LIFO Partners.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies conditions under which the Manager *shall* disconnect the LIFO Partners' projects. The modification replaces 'shall' with 'may, at its sole discretion,' fundamentally altering the mandatory nature of the disconnection to a discretionary one. Additionally, the specific, quantifiable reasons (e.g., 'Transmission Line line losses exceed 1.14%') are replaced with vague criteria like 'any disruption' or 'deemed excessive by the Manager.' This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the initial intent of clearly defined triggers for disconnection.",

                "original_text": "Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners. Such curtailment shall continue until the Manager shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment.",
                "changed_text": "Nothing in this agreement limits the Manager's absolute authority to disconnect any project, regardless of any other agreements. Curtailment amounts are at the Manager's discretion, up to a complete shutdown of all projects. The Manager decides when and if reconnection occurs.",
                "explanation": "This significantly broadens the Manager's power. The original text ties curtailment to specific technical conditions and references the Technical Use Agreement. The modified text removes these constraints, granting the Manager 'absolute authority' and unfettered discretion. This creates a direct conflict with the concept of contractual limitations and potentially violates the 'good faith and fair dealing' implied in contracts under California law.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If the LIFO Partners shall inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager shall effect any curtailment under these provisions according to such priority. If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager shall in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail. The Manager shall cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners.",
                "changed_text": "The Manager is not obligated to follow any agreements among the LIFO Partners. The Manager has sole authority to decide which projects to curtail. The Manager has no obligation to cooperate with the LIFO Partners and will not be responsible for any costs associated with curtailment.",
                "explanation": "This removes any obligation for the Manager to consider or cooperate with the LIFO Partners regarding curtailment priorities. The original text established a process where LIFO Partners could influence the order of curtailment. The modification eliminates this right and removes the cooperation clause, giving the manager complete unilateral control and contradicting the initial intent to have some level of partner input.",

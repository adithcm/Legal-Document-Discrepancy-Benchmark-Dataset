                "original_text": "The Professional acknowledges her obligations under the provisions of the Intellectual Property Rights Confidentiality and Non-Use Obligations Agreement attached hereto as \"Exhibit A\" and made a part hereof by this reference. The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A shall survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement, regardless of cause or circumstances of the termination or expiration.",
                "changed_text": "The Professional acknowledges her obligations under the provisions of the Intellectual Creations Confidentiality and Non-Use Obligations Agreement attached hereto as \"Exhibit A\" and made a part hereof by this reference. The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A shall be considered void after the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement, irrespective of the termination's reasoning.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Intellectual Property Rights' to 'Intellectual Creations' introduces ambiguity, as intellectual property has a well-defined legal meaning, whereas 'intellectual creations' is open to interpretation. Moreover, changing 'survive the termination' to 'void after the termination' directly contradicts the standard legal understanding of confidentiality agreements, which typically extend beyond the agreement's termination, creating uncertainty about the enforceability of confidentiality clauses.",

Recipient hereby assigns and agrees to assign all Recipient's rights in any Intellectual Property to the Company. Recipient hereby grants to the Company power of attorney for the purpose of assigning all Recipient's rights in Intellectual Property to the Company for the purposes of filings, registrations and other formalities deemed necessary by the Company to prosecute, protect, perfect or exploit its ownership and interests in Intellectual Property. Recipient further agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver any documentation, instruments, specifications or disclosures necessary to assign, prosecute, protect, perfect or exploit the Company ownership of Intellectual Property.",
                "changed_text": "Recipient further acknowledges and agrees that all new notions, ideas, progress, workflows, recipes, sketches, drafts, learning resources, unique literary pieces, stills, film reels, digital pictures, records, brand names and author rights (the \"Intellectual Property\"), that may be elaborated, imagined, or produced by Recipient, alone or jointly with others during her work for the Company, shall be considered co-owned by both the Company and the Recipient and shall not automatically be a work for hire. Recipient maintains all of her rights in any Intellectual Property, including the ability to license or sell them to third parties, unless otherwise specified in writing. The Company will not have the authority to act on behalf of the Recipient regarding Intellectual Property matters. Recipient is under no obligation to assist the Company in securing Intellectual Property protections.",
                "explanation": "The original clause designates all intellectual property created during the agreement as the Company's exclusive property and a 'work for hire,' which aligns with standard intellectual property assignment practices. The modified clause introduces several contradictions: co-ownership of intellectual property, explicitly denies the 'work for hire' status, reserves all rights for the Recipient (including the right to license to third parties), denies the Company power of attorney, and removes the obligation to assist with IP protection. These modifications fundamentally alter the ownership and control of intellectual property, contradicting standard legal interpretations of 'work for hire' doctrine and assignment agreements. This will create ambiguity and unenforceability.",

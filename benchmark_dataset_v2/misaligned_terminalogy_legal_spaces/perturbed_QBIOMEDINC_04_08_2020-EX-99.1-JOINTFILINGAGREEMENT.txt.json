                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. is, and any amendment thereto signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. may be, and any amendment thereto signed by each of the undersigned will be, filed on behalf of some of the undersigned according to the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"is\" to \"may be\" and \"shall be\" to \"will be\" and \"each of the undersigned\" to \"some of the undersigned\" introduces ambiguity and contradicts the mandatory nature of filing requirements under Rule 13d-1(k). It suggests that filing is optional and not all parties may be bound, undermining the agreement's enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each party may attempt to be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and best efforts will be used to ensure the accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, and it is generally understood that they are responsible for the accuracy of all information.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"shall be responsible\" to \"may attempt to be responsible\" and replacing \"completeness and accuracy\" with best efforts, the obligation to file accurately is weakened. Furthermore, asserting 'they are responsible for the accuracy of all information' contradicts the original agreement that each party is only responsible for their own information. This introduces uncertainty about liability for inaccuracies.",
                "contradicted_law": "Rule 13d-1(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding accuracy of filings.",

                "changed_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed in a limited number of counterparts, but each counterpart will be considered a separate instrument.",
                "explanation": "This contradicts the standard legal interpretation of counterparts, which are intended to form a single, unified agreement. By specifying 'a limited number' and stating each is a 'separate instrument,' the enforceability of the joint filing as a single agreement is undermined, and introduces uncertainty about the obligations of each party.",

                "original_text": "Surgical will provide sales representation services to Imprimis during the Term of this Agreement (Surgical and its sales representatives may be referred to collectively hereinafter as Surgical).",
                "changed_text": "Surgical will provide sales representation services to Imprimis during the Term of this Agreement (Surgical and its sales representatives may be referred to collectively hereinafter as the Contractor).",
                "explanation": "Changing the defined term from \"Surgical\" to \"Contractor\" within the same sentence creates ambiguity. While seemingly minor, legally \"Surgical\" refers to the corporation, while \"Contractor\" could imply individuals, leading to confusion about who is bound by the terms. This contradicts standard legal practice for clear entity definition.",

                "original_text": "Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Imprimis shall deliver to Surgical a report setting forth for such calendar quarter the calculation of the applicable Sales Commission due under this Agreement for the sale of the Product (as defined in the SOW).",
                "changed_text": "Within a reasonable time after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Imprimis may deliver to the Contractor a statement indicating sales figures; precise commission calculations are not required.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces a defined timeline with a subjective one (\"reasonable time\"), and removes the requirement for a detailed commission calculation. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard accounting practices, making enforcement of commission payments uncertain. Also replace `Surgical` to `Contractor` here.",

                "changed_text": "The Sales Team should ideally have some familiarity with medical sales; however, specific experience is not mandatory for providing the Services.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly lowers the bar for required experience. The original text mandates \"specific and sufficient\" experience which provides a basis for evaluating performance and compliance. By contrast, the modified text makes experience optional, contradicting the initial intent and potentially rendering the clause unenforceable due to vagueness.",

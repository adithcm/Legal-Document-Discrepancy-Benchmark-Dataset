Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period by written amendment to this Agreement. All amendments to this Agreement must be signed by all parties to this Agreement.",

Other products the Company considers to be similar may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period at the Company's discretion. Amendments to this agreement are encouraged but not required.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the requirement for written amendments signed by all parties with a discretionary addition of 'similar products' by the company. This contradicts standard contract law principles, where amendments usually require mutual agreement. It also creates ambiguity around what 'similar products' means, potentially leading to disputes.",

Donated amounts may be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter at any time during the full term of the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces a mandatory donation schedule with a discretionary donation possibility. By using terms like 'potentially' and 'may be allocated,' the obligation to donate and the timeline are no longer fixed, contradicting the initial intent of a binding commitment.",

                "explanation": "This change makes the provision of sales reports optional and at the company's discretion, negating the original transparency requirement. This contradicts principles of good faith and fair dealing, as it limits the NFLA-NC's ability to verify donation amounts.",

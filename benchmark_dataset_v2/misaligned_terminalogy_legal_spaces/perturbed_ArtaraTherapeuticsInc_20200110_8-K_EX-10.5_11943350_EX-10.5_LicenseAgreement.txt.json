                "original_text": "1.9 \"Net Sales\" means, with respect to the Product, the gross invoiced sales price payable to ArTara and/or its Affiliates and their respective licensees and sublicensees for sales anywhere in the world of the Product to a third party, less: (a) discounts (including cash, quantity and patient program discounts), retroactive price reductions, charge-back payments and rebates granted to managed health care organizations or to federal, state and local governments, their agencies, and purchasers and reimbursers or to trade customers; (b) credits or allowances actually, not to exceed the original invoice amount, granted upon claims, damaged goods, rejections or returns of the Product, including the Product returned in connection with recalls or withdrawals; (c) freight out, postage, shipping and insurance charges for delivery of the Product if charged separately and include in the gross receipts; and (d) taxes or duties, excluding income taxes and value-added taxes, levied on, absorbed or otherwise imposed on the sale of the Product, including governmental charges otherwise imposed upon the billed amount, as adjusted for rebates and refunds, provided that such are included in gross receipts and are paid to and/or its Affiliates and their respective licensees and sublicensees.\n\nNet Sales shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.",
                "changed_text": "1.9 \"Net Sales\" means, with respect to the Product, the gross invoiced sales price payable to ArTara and/or its Affiliates and their respective licensees and sublicensees for sales anywhere in the world of the Product to a third party, less: (a) discounts (including only cash discounts); (b) credits or allowances actually granted upon claims for damaged goods only; (c) freight out charges for delivery of the Product if charged separately and include in the gross receipts; and (d) taxes or duties, excluding income taxes, levied on, absorbed or otherwise imposed on the sale of the Product, including governmental charges otherwise imposed upon the billed amount, as adjusted for rebates and refunds, provided that such are included in gross receipts and are paid to and/or its Affiliates and their respective licensees and sublicensees.\n\nNet Sales shall be determined at ArTara's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly narrows the definition of 'Net Sales' by limiting the deductions. The original definition included various standard deductions, like rebates, price reductions and a broad range of credits, which are commonly accepted. By removing these and granting ArTara discretion in determining net sales, the calculation becomes arbitrary and deviates from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), potentially reducing royalty payments to the University in contradiction to common industry practices and fairness.",

All intellectual property or patentable inventions arising out of or in connection with the Project which is discovered or invented solely by or on behalf of ArTara shall be the exclusive property of ArTara.

                "explanation": "By changing the ownership of intellectual property solely discovered by the University and jointly discovered intellectual property to ArTara, the contract now contradicts standard intellectual property law and research agreements. Typically, universities retain ownership of IP generated by their employees or jointly with collaborators. This clause effectively deprives the University of its rights to its own inventions, potentially impacting its ability to commercialize or further research using these inventions.",

During the term of this Agreement each Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked \"Confidential\" by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as \"Confidential\" at the time of disclosure, unless the Receiving Party reasonably believes the Confidential Information is relevant to promoting its own business interests. There is no time limit to Confidentiality after the termination or expiration of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the seven-year confidentiality period after termination and the addition of the 'business interests' clause creates a significant loophole. The phrase 'reasonably believes' is subjective and allows the Receiving Party to disclose confidential information under the guise of promoting their business interests. This directly contradicts the purpose of a confidentiality clause and undermines the Disclosing Party's ability to protect its proprietary information even after the agreement ends. The lack of a time limit to confidentiality after the termination creates legal uncertainty.",

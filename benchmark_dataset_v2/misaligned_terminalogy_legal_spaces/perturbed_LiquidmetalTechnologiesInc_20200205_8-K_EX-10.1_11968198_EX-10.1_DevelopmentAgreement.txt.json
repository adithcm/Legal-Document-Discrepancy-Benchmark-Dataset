                "original_text": "For purposes hereof, the following definitions and provisions shall apply: (a) \"Field\" shall mean all fields of use except as described in the Field of Use Restrictions. (b) \"Field of Use Restrictions\" shall mean the exclusions, conditions, limitations, and restrictions described on Schedule 1 to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes hereof, the following definitions and provisions shall apply: (a) \"Field\" shall mean all fields of use, including those described in the Field of Use Restrictions. (b) \"Field of Use Restrictions\" shall mean suggestions, considerations, and examples described on Schedule 1 to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines \"Field\" with specific exclusions detailed in the \"Field of Use Restrictions.\" The modified text redefines \"Field\" to include the restrictions, creating a contradiction. Moreover, 'Field of Use Restrictions' are no longer exclusions, but 'suggestions' and 'examples'. This makes the scope of permitted use ambiguous and legally contradictory.",

                "original_text": "5.5 Right to Purchase. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Eutectix shall have the option to purchase some or all of the Licensed Equipment at fair market value, less any amounts owed to Eutectix by Liquidmetal, except the equipment listed under Section 2.1(b) above. The following additional terms shall apply to Eutectix's exercise of this option: (a) Eutectix's option hereunder shall be exercisable by providing Liquidmetal with written notice of its intention to exercise its chosen option no later than the effective date of termination. Such notice shall include a description of the assets Eutectix will purchase (the \"Optioned Assets\").",
                "changed_text": "5.5 Right to Purchase. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Eutectix shall have the option to purchase all or some of the Licensed Equipment at a mutually agreed price, taking into consideration Liquidmetalâ€™s initial investment. The following additional terms shall apply to Eutectix's exercise of this option: (a) Eutectix's option hereunder shall be exercisable by providing Liquidmetal with suggestive notice of its intention to exercise its chosen option at any time before or after the termination date. Such notice shall include a vague idea of what Eutectix might want to purchase.",
                "explanation": "The original 'fair market value' is replaced with 'mutually agreed price', contradicting a clear valuation method. The original deadline for notice is tied to the 'effective date of termination', the revised deadline is 'any time before or after the termination date'. The description of the assets to purchase becomes a 'vague idea'. These modifications make the right to purchase uncertain and open to disputes, particularly if 'mutually agreed price' is difficult to establish.",

For purposes hereof, \"Confidential Information\" shall mean any and all commercial, technical, financial, proprietary, and other information relating to a Discloser, its Affiliates, and their respective business operations, including, but not limited to, samples, data, technical information, know-how, formulas, ideas, inventions, discoveries, patents, patent applications, Intellectual Property, product development plans, demonstrations, business and financial information, applications and designs, and all manifestations or embodiments relating to the foregoing and all improvements made thereto, in whatever form provided, whether oral, written, visual, machine-readable, electronic, or otherwise.",

For purposes hereof, \"Confidential Information\" shall mean some commercial, technical, financial, and other information that the Discloser considers proprietary at the time of disclosure, including ideas the Discloser generally intends to keep secret. However, unless explicitly labeled 'Confidential,' information shared under this agreement is presumed non-confidential.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Confidential Information' broadly and inclusively. The modified text narrows this definition and introduces a contradictory 'unless explicitly labeled' clause. This conflicts with the expansive original intent, making it difficult to enforce confidentiality, since much information would be considered non-confidential. This contradicts the general understanding and legal enforceability of confidentiality agreements.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Dong-A agrees (i) to supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date in compliance with the KGMP, and (ii) to manufacture and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo in compliance with the KGMP, and NeuroBo agrees to purchase from Dong-A, the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Dong-A agrees (i) to supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date adhering to general industry practices, and (ii) to manufacture and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo following internal standards, and NeuroBo agrees to purchase from Dong-A, the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires compliance with KGMP (Korea Good Manufacturing Practices), a legally defined standard. The modified version replaces this with 'general industry practices' and 'internal standards', which are vague and undefined, potentially contradicting the requirement for adherence to KGMP. This creates uncertainty regarding the manufacturing standards that must be followed, making the agreement unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "2.1 Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A shall (i) supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date following standard procedures, and (ii) manufacture based on company guidelines and in conformity with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the \"Product Specifications\") and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the legally defined KGMP standard with 'standard procedures' and 'company guidelines.' KGMP has specific requirements and legal implications. Changing to a more ambiguous standard creates uncertainty about what manufacturing standards must be followed, making it difficult to enforce compliance and potentially contradicting regulatory requirements.",

                "explanation": "This change replaces the definite and legally recognized 'ICC Incoterms 2010' (international commercial terms) with 'customary shipping practices', and 'agreed upon verbally' which lacks any legal precedence, and replaced the specific timelines with 'reasonable time frame.' This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original intent to adhere to established international shipping standards. It also makes the agreement vague and hard to enforce due to the lack of clear, legally binding shipping terms.",

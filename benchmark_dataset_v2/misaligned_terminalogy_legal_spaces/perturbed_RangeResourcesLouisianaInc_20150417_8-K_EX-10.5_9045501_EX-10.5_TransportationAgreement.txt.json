                "changed_text": "\"Force Majeure\" shall mean circumstances that the parties agree should excuse performance. The specific examples outlined in Section 11.2 are guidelines but not limitations on events that may constitute Force Majeure.",
                "explanation": "The original contract references Section 11.2 for the definition of Force Majeure, which includes specific events like 'acts of God', 'strikes', etc., offering a degree of predictability. The modified text, however, introduces ambiguity by stating that the specific examples are guidelines rather than strict limitations. This change contradicts the purpose of defining Force Majeure, which is to provide clarity regarding circumstances excusing performance under the contract. By making the definition subjective ('circumstances that the parties agree should excuse performance'), the amendment clashes with the established legal concept of Force Majeure that relies on objective and unforeseen events.",

                "changed_text": "\"Claims\" shall mean legal requests or petitions that one party has against another for equitable remedies. Unless explicitly determined at the discretion of the Carrier, costs or legal expenses will be considered.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Claims' is broad and inclusive, encompassing 'any and all claims, demands, and causes of action' along with associated costs and fees. The modified definition narrows the scope to 'legal requests or petitions that one party has against another for equitable remedies.' By restricting claims to equitable remedies and making the inclusion of costs and legal expenses discretionary, the modified definition contradicts the original intent. This limitation could potentially hinder a party's ability to seek complete redress for breaches of contract. It restricts it only to what the carrier determines and the courts will not be the final say.",

                "changed_text": "\"Applicable Law\" shall mean the laws, statutes and formal rulings of the state of Texas. Any other legal authority or regulation is to be considered based on the sole discretion of the Carrier.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Applicable Law' is broad, encompassing laws and regulations from various jurisdictions and governmental authorities. The modified version restricts it to Texas laws, statues, and rulings while suggesting that other authorities are discretionary. This contradicts the comprehensive nature of 'Applicable Law', especially in contracts that may involve interstate commerce or other jurisdictions. By limiting the scope of 'Applicable Law', the modified definition creates legal uncertainty and potential non-compliance with relevant regulations outside Texas.",

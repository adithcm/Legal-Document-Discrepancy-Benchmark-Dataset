                "explanation": "The term \"Intellectual Property Rights\" has been replaced with \"tangible assets.\" This contradicts the standard legal definition of brand features, which usually includes trademarks and copyrights, classified as intangible assets. This change could lead to disputes over ownership and usage rights of the brand features.",

                "explanation": "The original definition includes a broad range of IP rights like trade secrets, which don't require registration. This modification limits 'Intellectual Property Rights' to registered rights, contradicting common legal understanding and potentially excluding unregistered but valid IP from protection under the contract.",

The parties are independent contractors              ------------------------- under  this  Agreement  and  no  other  relationship  is  intended,  including a partnership,  franchise,  joint  venture,  agency, employer/employee, fiduciary, master/servant  relationship, or other special relationship. Neither party shall act  in  a  manner  which expresses or implies a relationship other than that of independent  contractor,  nor  bind  the  other  party.",

Either party may act in a manner which expresses or implies a general agency relationship when conducting marketing on the other partyâ€™s behalf, and can obligate the other party to contracts with third-parties under $1,000. The non-acting party will then have 30 days to reimburse the acting party.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces elements of an agency relationship despite explicitly stating the relationship is that of independent contractors. The ability to bind the other party to contracts contradicts the definition of an independent contractor and creates legal ambiguity. The original text states that the parties are independent contractors, but this new line of text states that they are also able to act as agents of one another.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "BOSCH hereby grants CLIENT the \"Exclusive Distribution License Rights\" sell and distribute the Products within the \"Territory\". BOSCH hereby grants CLIENT un-exclusive \"Reserved Rights\" to sell and distribute the \"Product\" within the \"Territory\".",
                "changed_text": "BOSCH hereby grants CLIENT the \"Exclusive Distribution License Rights\" to market the Products within the \"Territory\". BOSCH hereby grants CLIENT non-exclusive \"Delegated Privileges\" to market the \"Product\" within the \"Territory\".",
                "explanation": "The term \"Exclusive Distribution License Rights\" is replaced with \"Exclusive Distribution License Rights\" to market, which narrows the legally defined scope of distribution rights. Additionally, \"Reserved Rights\" is replaced with \"Delegated Privileges,\" a term without a clearly defined legal meaning in distribution agreements, creating uncertainty in enforcement. There is conflict in how these terms can be interpreted, especially if a dispute arises regarding the extent of rights granted.",

This is in concert and approval with BOSCH and is limited to any and all of BOSCH's current clients. CLIENT will not exercise nor authorize any other Party to to take any action which would reasonably be deemed to derogate from, impair or compete with the Exclusive Rights, Reserved rights, and Rights Granted herein granted.",
                "changed_text": "All business, locations, entities, people, etc... without any limitations. This will be at the discretion of BOSCH and is limited to any and all of BOSCH's existing customers. CLIENT will not exercise nor authorize any other Party to take any action which could possibly be seen as interfering with the Exclusive Rights, Delegated Privileges, and Rights Granted under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The phrase \"in concert and approval with BOSCH\" is replaced with \"at the discretion of BOSCH,\" giving BOSCH unilateral power and undermining the principle of mutual agreement. The original wording limited the scope of reserved rights in concert with Bosch's approval. The altered text gives Bosch complete control. Furthermore, the term \"Reserved rights\" is changed to \"Delegated Privileges,\" which lacks a clear definition, creating legal ambiguity. Finally, the phrase 'reasonably be deemed' is replaced with 'possibly be seen' which makes the agreement more ambiguous and hard to enforce.",

                "original_text": "CLIENT acknowledges that irreparable injury and damage will result from the disclosure to any third party of Proprietary Information associated with the Product and agrees (1) not to disclose any Proprietary Information to any third party, and (2) not to allow any third party to possess, handle, disassemble, touch, photograph, film or otherwise record images of the Product while the Product is upon CLIENT'S premises or in CLIENT'S possession, custody or control if the product is or has not been purchased with a purchase order and payment fulfilled.",
                "changed_text": "CLIENT acknowledges that harm could potentially arise from the disclosure to any third party of Confidential Information pertaining to the Product and agrees (1) to attempt not to disclose any Confidential Information to any third party, and (2) to try to prevent any third party from possessing, handling, disassembling, touching, photographing, filming or otherwise recording images of the Product while the Product is upon CLIENT'S premises or in CLIENT'S possession, custody or control unless it has been purchased with a purchase order and payment fulfilled.",
                "explanation": "\"Irreparable injury and damage\" is changed to \"harm could potentially arise\", weakening the acknowledgment of harm from disclosure. Additionally, \"Proprietary Information\" is replaced with \"Confidential Information\", a less legally defined term, creating confusion. The language \"agrees not to disclose\" is changed to \"agrees to attempt not to disclose\" and \"not to allow\" becomes \"to try to prevent\", significantly weakening the obligation and providing loopholes. All of these weaken the agreement.",

Such term shall likewise include those instances (a) where either Transporter or Customer is required to obtain servitudes, rights-of-way, grants, permits or licenses to enable such Party to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and is unable to acquire or experiences delays in acquiring such servitudes, rights-of-way, grants, permits or licenses, at reasonable costs, and after the exercise of reasonable diligence, and (b) the partial or entire failure or refusal of Third Party Operators to receive or deliver Gas, or increases in pressure of upstream or downstream pipelines. Force Majeure shall not include failure of Gas supply due to pricing considerations.",
                "changed_text": "\"Force Majeure\" as used herein shall mean events beyond a party's reasonable control. This includes, but is not limited to, inclement weather, equipment malfunctions, and changes in market conditions. The term specifically excludes acts of God; strikes, lockouts, or other industrial disturbances; conditions arising from a change in governmental laws, orders, rules, or regulations; acts of public enemy; wars; blockades; insurrections; riots; epidemics; landslides; lightning; earthquakes; fires; storms; floods; washouts; arrests and restraints of governments and people; civil disturbances; explosions; breakage or accident to machinery or lines of pipe; the necessity for making repairs, tests, alterations, or performing maintenance to machinery or lines of pipe; scheduled maintenance; freezing of wells or lines of pipe; partial or entire failure of wells, processing, or gasification and gas manufacturing facilities; orders or directives of, or proceedings initiated by, any Governmental Authority; and any other causes, whether of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise, not within the control of the Party claiming relief hereunder, and which by the exercise of due diligence, such Party is unable to prevent or overcome. Such term shall likewise include those instances (a) where either Transporter or Customer is required to obtain servitudes, rights-of-way, grants, permits or licenses to enable such Party to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and is unable to acquire or experiences delays in acquiring such servitudes, rights-of-way, grants, permits or licenses, at reasonable costs, and after the exercise of reasonable diligence, and (b) the partial or entire failure or refusal of Third Party Operators to receive or deliver Gas, or increases in pressure of upstream or downstream pipelines. Force Majeure shall not include failure of Gas supply due to pricing considerations.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Force Majeure closely aligns with standard legal interpretations, specifying events beyond control and listing examples. The modified definition broadens the scope by including 'changes in market conditions', which are generally not considered Force Majeure under most legal frameworks. This change allows a party to potentially excuse performance due to economic factors, conflicting with the typical understanding and application of Force Majeure clauses and introducing ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "\"Thermal Content\" means, with respect to Gas, the product of (i) a volume of Gas and (ii) the Gross Heating Value of such Gas, adjusted to a same pressure base of 14.73 psia, as expressed in MMBtus.",
                "changed_text": "\"Thermal Content\" means, with respect to Gas, an estimate of the energy content based on readings from non-standardized equipment. This estimate may or may not reflect the actual energy content and will not be expressed in MMBtus.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Thermal Content' is precise, using standard measures (Gross Heating Value, adjusted pressure base) and units (MMBtus). The modified definition introduces ambiguity and deviates from industry norms by relying on 'estimates' from 'non-standardized equipment' and omitting the unit of measurement. This contradicts established practices for measuring and compensating for gas transportation, creating uncertainty in billing and allocation of gas.",

                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" shall mean, when used with respect to any Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Person. For this purpose, \"control\" of any Person shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, by ownership of voting interest, by contract or otherwise. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) with respect to PennTex Midstream Partners, LLC and its subsidiaries, the term \"Affiliate\" shall exclude Memorial Resource Development Corp. and each of its subsidiaries and (ii) with respect to Memorial Resource Development Corp. and its subsidiaries, the term \"Affiliate\" shall exclude PennTex Midstream Partners, LLC and each of its subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" shall mean any entity vaguely associated with a Person, as determined solely by that Person's discretion, regardless of actual control or ownership. Any determination by a Party of whether an entity is an affiliate is final and not subject to dispute.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a standard and legally defensible definition of 'Affiliate' based on control, either through ownership or contractual means. The modified definition replaces this with a vague 'vaguely associated' standard determined at the sole discretion of each party. This creates a significant conflict, as the definition of 'Affiliate' is crucial for determining related-party transactions, potential conflicts of interest, and the scope of certain contractual obligations. This unilateral discretion directly contradicts the objective standard of 'control' typically used in legal and financial contexts, making enforcement of provisions related to affiliates uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows amendments to be filed without additional joint filing agreements, consistent with standard SEC practices. The modified text contradicts this by mandating separate agreements for each amendment, conflicting with established regulatory filing procedures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that filing the agreement isn't an admission of group status. The altered text implies the opposite - a tacit acknowledgement of association, which could contradict the filer's intent and create legal ambiguity regarding group status under SEC regulations.",

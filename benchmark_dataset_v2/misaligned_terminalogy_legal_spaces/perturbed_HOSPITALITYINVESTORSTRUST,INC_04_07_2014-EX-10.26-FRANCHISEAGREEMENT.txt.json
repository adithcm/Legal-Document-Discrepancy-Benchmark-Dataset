                "changed_text": "\"Effective Date\" means a target date that may be subject to change upon our discretion on which this Agreement becomes initially considered.",
                "explanation": "By using the phrase **'a target date that may be subject to change'**, this modification completely subverts the legal enforceability of the contract by creating uncertainty. The 'Effective Date' is crucial for determining obligations and timelines, and making it flexible leads to potential disputes and unenforceable terms.",

For the Hotel to be considered under construction, you must have begun to pour concrete foundations for the Hotel or otherwise satisfied any site-specific criteria for \"under construction\" set out in the Addendum.",
                "changed_text": "\"Construction Commencement Date\" means the estimated date set out in the Addendum, if applicable, by which you are expected to commence construction of the Hotel. For the Hotel to be considered under construction, starting the process to pour concrete foundations for the Hotel may qualify as under construction if approved by the Franchisor.",
                "explanation": "The term **'Construction Commencement Date'** was made into an **'estimated date'**, creating uncertainty. This could cause disputes over project timelines and milestones. The definition of what is considered \"under construction\" is now subject to approval by the Franchisor, giving them arbitrary power.",

                "explanation": "This modification states **'what we deem to be the applicable laws'**, directly contradicting the established legal definition of 'Laws.' This allows the Franchisor to decide which laws the Franchisee must follow, ignoring statutory and regulatory requirements. This deviation creates ambiguity and potential legal issues related to compliance and liability.",

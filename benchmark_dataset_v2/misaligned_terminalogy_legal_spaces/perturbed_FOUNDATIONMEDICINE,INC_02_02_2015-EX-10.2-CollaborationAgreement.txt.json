Confidential Information shall not include any information, data or know-how that:\n\n  (i) was generally available to the public at the time of disclosure, or information that becomes available to the public after disclosureby the Disclosing Party other than through fault (whether by action or inaction) of the Receiving Party or its Affiliates,\n\n  (ii) can be evidenced by written records to have been already known to the Receiving Party or its Affiliates prior to its receipt fromthe Disclosing Party,\n\n  (iii) is obtained by the Receiving Party at any time lawfully from a Third Party under circumstances permitting its use or disclosure,\n\n  (iv) is developed independently by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates as evidenced by written records other than throughknowledge of Confidential Information, or\n\n  (v) is approved in writing by the Disclosing Party for release by the Receiving Party.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by redefining “Confidential Information” in a way that conflicts with standard legal interpretations and common law. The original definition excludes information already publicly available or independently developed. The modified definition includes information even if it is publicly available or known, fundamentally altering what constitutes confidential information and potentially leading to disputes over what information is protected under the agreement. This change is related to trade secret and contract law, where the definition of 'confidential' is crucial for enforcement.",

                "original_text": "The term \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" shall mean, with respect to the performance of an obligation under this Agreement, such quality and level of effort as is required to carry out such obligation in a sustained manner, consistent with the efforts Roche or FMI, as applicable, devotes to a similar obligation in connection with an internally developed product or service that is at the same stage of development or commercialization, as applicable, in a similar market, with similar market potential, at a similar stage of product life, taking into account the existence of other competitive products or services in the market place or under development, the proprietary position of the product or service, the regulatory structure involved, the anticipated profitability of the product or service and other relevant factors. It is understood that such quality and level if effort may change from time to time based upon changing scientific, business and marketing and return on investment considerations.",
                "changed_text": "The term \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" shall mean, with respect to the performance of an obligation under this Agreement, such quality and level of effort as the Party deems necessary at its sole discretion. The Party is not required to consider market conditions, competitive landscape, profitability, or any other factors beyond its own internal assessment of what constitutes a reasonable effort.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a detailed, objective standard for 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts,' referencing industry norms, market conditions, and profitability. The modified clause replaces this with a subjective standard ('as the Party deems necessary at its sole discretion'), eliminating the requirement to consider external factors. This creates a legal contradiction because 'commercially reasonable efforts' typically implies an objective, industry-standard assessment, whereas the modified definition allows a party to fulfill the obligation based solely on its own subjective judgment. This introduces uncertainty and potential unenforceability, contradicting standard contract interpretation principles. This modification affects contract law and business law, where the interpretation of 'reasonable efforts' is often litigated.",

                "changed_text": "The term \"Patent Rights\" shall mean rights to exclude others from the invention as per the inventor's discretion. The inventor solely decides which countries to file for patents in, and their decisions are binding on the collaboration. Rights under any patent or patent application, in one select country within the Territory, including any patents issuing on such patent application, and further including any extension certificate, reissue, reexamination, and the original patent.",
                "explanation": "This alteration significantly narrows the definition of 'Patent Rights.' The original definition includes all rights under any patent or patent application in any country within the defined territory, as well as continuations, reissues, and extensions. The modified definition restricts the scope to a single country chosen by the inventor, excludes continuations and divisions, and limits the included rights. This directly contradicts the conventional understanding of patent rights, which encompass a bundle of rights across various jurisdictions and include the ability to pursue continuations to broaden protection. By limiting the geographic scope and excluding standard patent prosecution strategies, the modification creates uncertainty and potential disputes over the ownership and enforcement of intellectual property, therefore affecting intellectual property law.",

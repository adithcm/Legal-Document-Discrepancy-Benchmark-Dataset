(\"Supplier\") and Bank of America, N. A, (\"Bank of America\"), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (\"SLCMA\").

(\"Supplier\") and Bank of America, N. A, (\"Bank of America\"), dated November 5, 2010, as amended (\"SLCMA\"). Each capitalized term used but not explicitly defined herein shall have the meaning assigned at the discretion of the Supplier.",
                "explanation": "The term 'capitalized term' refers to specific terms within a contract that hold particular legal significance. While, contractually, capitalized terms derive their meanings from the SLCMA, the modification gives 'Supplier' the unilateral power to assign meaning to those terms that are not explicitly defined, deviating from standard contractual interpretation principles. This creates ambiguity and potential for misinterpretation in the contract.",

                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Bank of America and Supplier entered into the SLCMA in order to set forth the understanding pursuant to which Supplier provides certain Software to Bank of America,\n\nWHEREAS, the parties hope to add to the SLCMA the Supplier Offer Placement System Software;",
                "explanation": "The original text uses the words 'terms and conditions' and 'desire' with legal precision. Terms and conditions are specific legal obligations, whereas 'understanding' is less committal. Replacing 'desire' with 'hope' removes the obligation to actually include the 'Supplier Offer Placement System Software,' creating uncertainty about what will actually be provided and undermining the contract's enforceability. Also, hope doesn't impose a legal obligation.",

                "explanation": "The original language is precise and creates an 'agreement'. The revised language is uncertain and creates a 'might agree'. 'Promises and accords' are specific and binding, where as 'expressions of interest' is neither. 'Good and valuable consideration' is a legal term. Replacing with 'general impression of good and valuable consideration' makes the consideration questionable. 'Receipt and sufficiency' is a factual statement, but 'receipt and potential sufficiency' implies the possibility of it being insufficient, thereby potentially voiding the contract for lack of consideration. Adding 'may be acknowledged' makes the 'acknowledgment' optional, further weakening the consideration clause.",

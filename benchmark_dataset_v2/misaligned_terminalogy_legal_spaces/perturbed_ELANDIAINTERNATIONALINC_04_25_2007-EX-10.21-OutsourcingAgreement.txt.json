The Network Management Outsourcing Agreement.\n\n\"CPI\" means an amount determined by reference to All Groups Indexes for Urban Areas being the figure relating to the weighted urban average for PNG contained in the Consumer Price Index published by the Papua New Guinea Bureau of Statistics each quarter in the Papua New Guinea Statistical Bulletin.",
                "changed_text": "\"Agreement\" means this agreement, but it can be revised unilaterally by Datec with a 30-day notice.\n\n\"CPI\" may be determined at Datec's discretion, referencing any economic indicator they deem appropriate, notwithstanding the Papua New Guinea Bureau of Statistics.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Agreement\" implies a mutual understanding and fixed terms. Altering it to allow unilateral revisions by Datec contradicts the standard legal understanding of contracts requiring mutual consent for modifications. The original definition for 'CPI' is very specific. Datec's discretion is against the intention and could be abused.",

                "original_text": "The relationship of the Parties established by this Agreement is that of independent contractors, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to: (a) give either Party the power to direct and control the day-to-day activities of the other Party, (b) establish the Parties as partners, joint ventures, co-owners or otherwise as participants in a joint or common undertaking, or (c) allow a Party to bind the other Party in any manner or otherwise create or assume any obligation on behalf of the other Party for any purpose whatsoever. A Party will not be considered an agent of the other Party.",
                "changed_text": "The relationship of the Parties established by this Agreement is that of independent contractors; however, Pactiv LLC, as Buyer, shall have the right to direct and control certain aspects of Reynolds Consumer Products LLC's manufacturing process to ensure product quality. This Agreement shall not be construed to: (a) give either Party the power to direct and control all of the day-to-day activities of the other Party, except as explicitly stated regarding product quality control, (b) establish the Parties as partners, joint ventures, co-owners or otherwise as participants in a joint or common undertaking, or (c) allow a Party to bind the other Party in any manner or otherwise create or assume any obligation on behalf of the other Party for any purpose whatsoever. A Party will not be considered an agent of the other Party, except when Buyer is exercising its quality control rights.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the definition of 'independent contractor.' By granting the Buyer the right to 'direct and control certain aspects' of the Seller's manufacturing process, the contract creates an element of control that is inconsistent with the common and legal understanding of an independent contractor relationship. The additional exception for the buyer exercising its quality control rights further blurs the lines.",

                "original_text": "If Buyer fails to pay Seller an amount owed under this Agreement by the invoice due date, then Buyer will owe Seller: (i) the delinquent amount; and (ii) a late payment fee equal to two percent (2%) of the delinquent amount for each full or partial calendar month past the invoice due date that the delinquent amount remains unpaid. In addition, if Seller has to file litigation to collect the amount owed and Seller prevails in the litigation, Buyer will reimburse Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in collecting the delinquent amount and accrued late payment fees on the delinquent amount. Under no circumstance will the late payment fee payable to Seller exceed the amount that a creditor may lawfully impose on a debtor on a delinquent amount under Applicable Law.",
                "changed_text": "If Buyer fails to pay Seller an amount owed under this Agreement by the invoice due date, then Buyer will owe Seller: (i) the delinquent amount; and (ii) a service charge determined by the Seller for each full or partial calendar month past the invoice due date that the delinquent amount remains unpaid. This charge will be added at the Seller's discretion. In addition, if Seller has to file litigation to collect the amount owed and Seller prevails in the litigation, Buyer will reimburse Seller for expenses incurred by Seller in collecting the delinquent amount. The service charge payable to Seller will be decided by the Seller.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction with usury laws. By replacing 'late payment fee' with 'service charge determined by the Seller', and removing a maximum amount, the contract creates uncertainty about the amount the Buyer may owe. This deviates from established legal principles governing interest rates and usury.",

Examples of events of Force Majeure include, without limitation: natural disasters; war; acts of terrorism; government action; accident; strikes, slowdowns and other labor disputes; shortages in or inability to obtain material, equipment, transportation or labor; any breach, negligence, criminal misconduct or other act or omission of any third-party; fire or other insured or uninsured casualty.",
                "changed_text": "A Party will not be considered in breach of this Agreement or liable to the other Party for any interruption or delay in performance under this Agreement to the extent caused by circumstances they deem unavoidable. Examples include: natural disasters; war; acts of terrorism; government action; accident; strikes, slowdowns and other labor disputes; shortages in or inability to obtain material, equipment, transportation or labor; any breach, negligence, criminal misconduct or other act or omission of any third-party; fire or other insured or uninsured casualty; changes in market conditions.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'ability of the performing Party to foresee and avoid with the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts' with 'circumstances they deem unavoidable' and adding 'changes in market conditions,' the contract broadens the definition of Force Majeure significantly. This contradicts the established legal understanding of Force Majeure, which requires the event to be unforeseeable and unavoidable despite reasonable efforts. Changes in market conditions are typically considered a normal business risk and are not covered under Force Majeure.",

Lobby Promotions and Event Sponsorships are excluded from this definition.",
                "explanation": "The original definition includes Lobby Promotions and Event Sponsorships, but the modified version excludes them, directly contradicting the original scope and creating confusion about revenue sharing and service obligations. The exclusion contradicts the original intent and could lead to disputes over revenue calculations from these sources.",

The passes shall be provided to NCM at least 30 days prior to the month in  which such passes first become valid.",

The vouchers shall be provided to NCM when and if Network Affiliate deems it appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the original requirement for a fixed number of passes with a defined expiry, making it optional and with variable terms. The original text created an obligation to issue 25 passes but the modification allows the passes to vary. This introduces uncertainty and directly alters the terms of the agreement.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, any change of control, merger, consolidation, or acquisition  of all or substantially all of the assets of Network Affiliate (collectively, a \"Change of Control\") shall be deemed an assignment.

The restriction in the original text is intended to allow one party to have control over the other party but that is changed in the modified text.",

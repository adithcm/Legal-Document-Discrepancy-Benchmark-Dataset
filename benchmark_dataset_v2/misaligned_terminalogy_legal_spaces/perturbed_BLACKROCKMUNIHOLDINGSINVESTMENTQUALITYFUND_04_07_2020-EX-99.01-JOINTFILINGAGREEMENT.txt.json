                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, each party hereto hereby agrees to the joint filing, on behalf of each of them, of any filing required by such party under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and, if such security is registered on a national securities exchange, also with the exchange), and further agrees to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, each party hereto hereby consents to collaborative filing, on behalf of each of them, of any submission preferred by such party under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any modification, reiteration, adjunct, and/or display thereto) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and, if such security is cataloged on a national securities exchange, also with the exchange), and additionally consents to the filing, furnishing, and/or integration by reference of this agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to the joint filing' to 'consents to collaborative filing' weakens the binding nature of the agreement to file jointly. Using 'submission preferred' instead of 'filing required' introduces ambiguity as to whether mandatory filings are actually agreed upon. Replacing 'amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit' with 'modification, reiteration, adjunct, and/or display' dilutes the specificity of covered documents. Switching 'registered' to 'cataloged' misuses terminology in the context of securities exchanges. All of these changes create uncertainty about the parties' obligations under the Exchange Act.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'agreement' with 'understanding' weakens the legally binding nature of the contract. Substituting 'full force and effect' with 'substantial validity' introduces ambiguity about the degree to which the agreement is enforceable. Changing 'revoked' to 'rescinded' is a technical alteration that, when combined with the other changes, blurs the clarity of the termination clause. The phrase 'signed writing' is replaced with 'written notification', again reducing the formality and legal weight.",

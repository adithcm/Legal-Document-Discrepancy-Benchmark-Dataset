                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Gross Revenues' is comprehensive and clearly defined what is included and excluded. By changing 'all revenue' to 'most revenue' and 'does not include' to 'may not include', the definition becomes ambiguous and gives the franchisee potential leeway to interpret what constitutes Gross Revenue, leading to potential disputes and underreporting, conflicting with standard accounting practices.",

If you wish to use a vehicle to provide delivery services (a \"Delivery Vehicle\") as part of your Franchised Business, you must comply with the specifications and standards that we may periodically prescribe in the Manuals for Delivery Vehicles.

If you wish to use a vehicle to provide delivery services (a \"Delivery Vehicle\") as part of your Franchised Business, you must attempt to comply with the suggestions and standards that we may periodically suggest in the Manuals for Delivery Vehicles. Our suggestions and standards may include, among other things: Delivery Vehicles general make and model; general statements on the Life for a Delivery Vehicle and non-binding maintenance or repair services.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with specific standards for delivery vehicles. By softening the language to 'attempt to comply' and changing 'specifications and standards' to 'suggestions and standards', the franchisee's obligation becomes unclear and less enforceable. Also, changing 'designating Delivery Vehicles specific make and model; limitations on the Useful Life for a Delivery Vehicle and standards for maintenance or repair services' to 'Delivery Vehicles general make and model; general statements on the Life for a Delivery Vehicle and non-binding maintenance or repair services.' conflicts with general safety and branding regulations for vehicle standards.",

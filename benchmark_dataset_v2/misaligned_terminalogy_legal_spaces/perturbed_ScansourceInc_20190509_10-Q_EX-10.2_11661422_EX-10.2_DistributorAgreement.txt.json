                "original_text": "Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain thirty (30) days of stock in Distributor's inventory to support sales. Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor's inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.",

Xplore acknowledges that from time to time, Distributor's inventory levels may fall below the thirty (30) days goal that is agreed upon by both Parties. If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, at its sole discretion, may replenish the stock based on internal availability.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Xplore 'shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties' after a certain period. The modified text replaces this with 'Xplore, at its sole discretion, may replenish the stock based on internal availability.' This creates a legal contradiction because the original text establishes a mutual agreement obligation for replenishing stock, whereas the changed text makes it discretionary for Xplore, removing the Distributor's right to a mutually agreed replenishment. The statutory implication involves breach of contract, depending on whether a 'commercially reasonable effort' is legally defined and whether the Distributor can demonstrate damages resulting from Xplore's failure to replenish stock as initially agreed.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010, whereby Distributor's price, includes all costs of delivery, insurance, import and / or export duties and tariffs. Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Distribution Agreement, and unless notified by Xplore otherwise, shipping terms for Xplore Products will be subject to standard shipping practices, where Distributor's price, includes all costs of delivery. All other expenses, including insurance, import and/or export duties and tariffs, are the responsibility of Distributor, unless otherwise specified in the purchase order.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that shipping terms are 'Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) INCOTERMS® 2010', meaning Xplore covers all delivery costs, including duties and tariffs. The modified text changes this to 'subject to standard shipping practices,' which is vague, and then states that the Distributor is responsible for all other expenses (insurance, duties, tariffs). This creates a contradiction because the original clause clearly defines who is responsible for these costs, while the modification shifts these responsibilities to the Distributor, directly conflicting with the initial DDP agreement. This contradicts standard definitions under international commercial law (INCOTERMS®) related to shipping responsibilities, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that 'Xplore shall provide…at no charge' proof of delivery. The modified text changes 'shall provide' to 'may provide with associated administrative fees' and 'Xplore shall provide packing slips for all shipments' to 'Xplore will endeavor to provide packing slips for all shipments.' This contradiction arises because the original text creates an obligation for Xplore to provide proof of delivery at no cost, whereas the modified text makes it discretionary and introduces fees and removes the obligation. The standard under US contract law would expect that both parties maintain the obligations within a reasonable interpretation of the initial agreement, unless there is a defined method to change.",

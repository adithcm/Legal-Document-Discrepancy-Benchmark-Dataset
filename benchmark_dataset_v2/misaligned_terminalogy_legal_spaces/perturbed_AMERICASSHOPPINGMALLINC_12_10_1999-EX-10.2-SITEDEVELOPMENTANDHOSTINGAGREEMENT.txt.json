                "original_text": "The Parties agree that and acknowledge that the relationship of the Parties is in the nature of an independent contractor. This Agreement shall not be deemed to create a partnership or joint venture and neither Party is the other's agent, partner, employee or representative.",

This Agreement shall not be deemed to create a partnership or joint venture and neither Party is the other's agent, partner, employee or representative.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"independent contractor\" to \"independent worker\" introduces ambiguity. While the contract intends to establish an independent contractor relationship (defined under common and statutory law), \"worker\" is a broader term. Some jurisdictions differentiate between \"worker\" and \"independent contractor,\" particularly regarding employment benefits and liabilities. This alteration creates uncertainty regarding the nature of the relationship.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws\" to \"possibly considering conflict of laws principles at the enforcer's discretion\", the predictability of legal interpretation is undermined. Standard contract law dictates a clear choice of law clause. Introducing discretion contradicts this, potentially invalidating the clause or leading to unpredictable enforcement based on subjective interpretation.",

                "explanation": "This alteration significantly weakens the definition of Confidential Information. Removing the burden of demonstration, removing Time of Receipt reference, and using ambiguous terms like 'generally discussed' and 'some party' makes it substantially harder to protect trade secrets. This contradicts standard legal definitions of confidential information and trade secret protection laws, allowing HDI broad leeway to claim information isn't confidential.",

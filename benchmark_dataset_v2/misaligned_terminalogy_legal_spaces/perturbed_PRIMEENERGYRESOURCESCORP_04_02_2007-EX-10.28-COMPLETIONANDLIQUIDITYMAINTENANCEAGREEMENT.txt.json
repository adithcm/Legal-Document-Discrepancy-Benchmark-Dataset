                "explanation": "Changing \"Project Field\" to \"Development Area\" introduces ambiguity. While 'Project Field' is specifically defined in the context of oil and gas operations with reference to OCS blocks, 'Development Area' is a broader term with no defined legal meaning under Texas law regarding oil and gas leases or regulations. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes a discrete area for completion obligations.",

In addition, for each Project Field, Project Completion will include,  but not limited to:\n\na) obtaining required permits, easements and governmental approvals;\n\nb) executing necessary\" construction contract(s);\n\nc) completing tests considered usual and customary\" and required to be conducted with results tn accordance with those necessary\" to  permit operations;\n\nd) ensuring that each Project Field is free and clear of all bens other than those in favor of Guaranty and Permitted Liens under the Credit  Agreement and:\n\ne) causing all costs of the Development Project to be paid when due; and,\n\nB) the 12-inch loop pipeline fromNorth Padre Island Area OCS Block 996 to the pipeline owned by the Williams Companies Inc. having been  constructed and installed in accordance with the plans and specifications in the construction contracts).",

In addition, for each Development Area, Operational Readiness will generally include:\n\na) attempts to obtain some permits and approvals;\n\nb) drafting a construction contract;\n\nc) performing a few tests if convenient to permit potential operations;\n\nd) aiming to ensure each Development Area has limited liens and:\n\ne) attempting to pay some costs associated with the project; and\n\nB) a loosely defined pipeline connecting to another company's infrastructure.",
                "explanation": "Substituting \"Project Completion\" with \"Operational Readiness\" dramatically alters the obligations. 'Project Completion' is comprehensively defined with clear benchmarks. 'Operational Readiness' is a vague standard. Additionally, replacing defined requirements like 'obtaining required permits' with weaker phrases like 'attempts to obtain some permits' contradicts the original intent and introduces potential disputes. By using 'generic' rather than 'readily available,' 'some' rather than 'all', creates uncertainty, and further dilutes the legal enforceability of the completion obligations. The shift to subjective terms creates an unenforceable agreement, violating contract law principles.",

                "changed_text": "Prime intends, to its best effort, during the general timeframe of the Credit Agreement, to possess some liquidity consisting of potential revolver availability and/or somewhat accessible cash, maybe around $20,000,000, perhaps adjusted depending on shareholder activities. Prime considers providing additional shareholder loans, potentially related to earlier repayments, conceivably to assist with any project.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"maintain liquidity\" with \"intends, to its best effort, to possess some liquidity\" and \"unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $25,000,000\" with \"somewhat accessible cash, maybe around $20,000,000\", the change drastically weakens the obligation. The original clause provides a specific, measurable requirement, while the modified text introduces subjectivity and uncertainty. The phrases 'potential', 'somewhat', 'maybe around', and 'conceivably' replace definitive obligations with vague aspirations, making this clause unenforceable. The original clause provided concrete liquidity requirements, while the modified clause creates a purely discretionary action on Prime's part, making it an illusory promise under Texas contract law.",

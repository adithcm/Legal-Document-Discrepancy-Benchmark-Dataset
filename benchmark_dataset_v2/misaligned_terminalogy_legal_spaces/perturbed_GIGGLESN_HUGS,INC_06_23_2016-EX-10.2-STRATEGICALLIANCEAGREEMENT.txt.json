                "changed_text": "Consultant is retained by the Company as an associate to introduce investors, celebrity spokespersons, press and media relationships, raise public awareness of the company and its public securities, and for other services related to Consultant's expertise",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'Independent Contractor' with 'associate'. This introduces a contradiction because the contract later treats the Consultant as an independent contractor, which has specific legal implications under California and US labor laws. Changing the term to 'associate' creates ambiguity about the true nature of the relationship, potentially misclassifying the worker.",

                "explanation": "Contradicts the standard definition of an independent contractor, which explicitly states they are not agents or employees and do not have the authority to bind the company. Granting the consultant the authority to bind the company, even with limitations, blurs the lines and creates potential legal issues. It could lead to the consultant being misclassified, violating labor laws and potentially creating agency liability for the company in California.",

                "changed_text": "Consultant will report all compensation received as self-employment income or wage depending on discretion from the Company",
                "explanation": "This change makes reporting compensation ambiguous. The IRS guidelines require clarity on whether someone is an employee or independent contractor. Allowing discretion on how income is reported based on Company preference, contradicts legal definition. This shift in compensation reporting could lead to potential issues related to tax and employment regulations.",

L. No. 111-148) as amended or replaced, but not including taxes assessed against the income derived from such sale); (ii) trade, quantity and cash discounts, allowances, retroactive price adjustments, credit incentive payments, chargebacks, patient support programs, and rebates (including governmental rebates or other price reductions provided, based on sales by ETON to any Governmental Entity or regulatory authority in respect of state or federal Medicare, Medicaid, government pricing or similar programs;); and (iii) any costs incurred in connection with or arising out of compliance with any Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies approved by the FDA and (iv) any expenses associated with serialization of the Products. Distribution of Licensed Products for clinical trials or as samples will not be deemed a \"Net Sale\" under this definition.",

Distribution of Licensed Products for clinical trials or as samples will not be deemed a \"Net Sale\" under this definition.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Sales' specifies several deductions from Gross Sales based on standard accounting practices, including taxes, discounts, and rebates. The modified version drastically reduces these deductions, limiting them only to 'amounts refunded or credited for returned goods'. This change contradicts generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and standard business practices, where deductions like taxes and rebates are legally required or commercially necessary. This discrepancy introduces uncertainty about the actual revenue calculation, making the royalty and milestone payments potentially unenforceable as it deviates from typical accounting practices.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliates' is based on a clear, legally recognized standard of control â€“ ownership of at least 50% of voting share capital. The modified version replaces this objective measure with subjective terms like 'considers to be associated with' and 'influence.' This introduces ambiguity because 'influence' is not a well-defined legal term, creating legal uncertainty about the scope of the 'Affiliates'. This contradicts standard corporate definitions and makes it harder to enforce provisions related to affiliates within the contract.",

Neither Party shall be liable for non-performance or delay in the fulfillment of its obligations when any such non- performance or delay shall be occasioned by any unforeseeable cause beyond the reasonable control of Aucta or ETON, as the case may be, including without limitation, acts of God, fire, flood, earthquakes, explosions, sabotage, strikes or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, military invasions, war, terrorism, failure of utilities, failure of carriers, or any acts, restraints, requisitions, tariffs, regulations, or directives issues by a Governmental Entity (\"Force Majeure Events\"). In the event either Party is prevented from discharging its obligations hereunder on account of a Force Majeure Event, such Party shall notify the other forthwith and shall nevertheless make every endeavor in good faith to discharge its said obligations even if in a partial or compromised manner. If either Party is unable to perform its obligations hereunder as a result of a Force Majeure Event for a period of thirty (30) days or greater, then the other Party shall have the right, following sixty (60) days' notice to the other Party to terminate the Agreement if the Force Majeure Event still exists following such sixty (60) day notice period. In the event Force Majeure Event impacts the manufacture or supply of Products, the annual minimums required under 6.3.2 shall be suspended for the period of the Force Majeure and the annual minimum adjusted to prorate the annual minimum to account for the period of Force Majeure suspension (e.g. one month Force Majeure reduces annual minimum by 1/12).",

Neither Party shall be liable for non-performance or delay in the fulfillment of its obligations when any such non- performance or delay shall be occasioned by any cause the Party claims is disruptive. In the event either Party is prevented from discharging its obligations hereunder on account of a Force Majeure Event, such Party shall notify the other when practical. If either Party is simply unable to perform its obligations hereunder, then the other Party may terminate the agreement at their discretion. In the event of such an Event, the annual minimums required under 6.3.2 will not be suspended.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Force Majeure' includes specific, unforeseeable events beyond reasonable control, aligning with the legal standard for force majeure clauses. The modified version replaces this with the vague term 'any cause the Party claims is disruptive'. This subjective standard eliminates the requirement for the event to be unforeseeable or beyond reasonable control, potentially allowing a party to invoke force majeure for routine business challenges. Furthermore, removing the annual minimum suspension adds a financial penalty. This broadens the scope of force majeure in an unenforceable manner, contrary to legal norms and creates uncertainty about contract obligations under unforeseen circumstances.",

                "original_text": "\"Active Country\" has the meaning set forth in Section 4.4(b). \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to each Party, any corporation, firm, partnership or other entity or Person which directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by or is under common control with that Party. A Person will be regarded as in \"control\" (including, with correlative meaning, the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") of another Person if it (a) owns or controls at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity securities of the subject Person entitled to vote in the election of directors, or (b) possesses, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of any such Person (whether through ownership of securities or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise).",
                "changed_text": "\"Active Country\" has the meaning set forth in Section 4.4(b). \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to each Party, any corporation, firm, partnership or other entity or Person which directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by or is under common control with that Party. A Person will be regarded as in \"control\" (including, with correlative meaning, the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") of another Person if it (a) owns or controls at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the equity securities of the subject Person entitled to vote in the election of directors, or (b) possesses, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of any such Person (whether through ownership of securities or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise).",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'control' has been altered from owning 'at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity securities' to 'at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the equity securities'. This contradicts the standard legal and financial definition of control, which typically requires a higher threshold (over 50%) to exert significant influence or decision-making power over an entity. By lowering the threshold, it creates ambiguity and potential legal disputes over which entities qualify as 'Affiliates' and are thus subject to the terms of the agreement, potentially impacting obligations, liabilities, and rights under the contract.",

With respect to the Promotion or other exploitation of the Product, \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means [***].",

With respect to the Promotion or other exploitation of the Product, \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means [***].",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' has been altered to include language that weakens the standard of effort required. Replacing 'reasonable, diligent and good faith efforts' with 'minimal, somewhat diligent and somewhat good faith efforts' directly contradicts established legal interpretations of commercially reasonable efforts. This change introduces ambiguity and a lower standard, making it difficult to enforce the intended level of commitment to promoting the product. This alteration creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it is unclear what level of effort is actually required.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the definition of 'Confidential Information' by changing 'any and all information' to 'some information' and 'the terms' to 'parts of the terms' introduces a significant contradiction. The original definition provides a broad scope of protection for disclosed information. The modified definition is vague and open to interpretation, creating uncertainty about what information is actually considered confidential. This lack of clarity makes it challenging to enforce confidentiality obligations and could lead to disputes over the protection of sensitive data.",

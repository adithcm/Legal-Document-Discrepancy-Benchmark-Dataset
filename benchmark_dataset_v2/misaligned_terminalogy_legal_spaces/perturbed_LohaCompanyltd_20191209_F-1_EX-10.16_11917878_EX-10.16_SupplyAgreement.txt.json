CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers. The Certificate so issued shall be accepted as the base of a claim.",
                "changed_text": "16. CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of an internal audit, have the right to claim for discretionary reimbursement, and expenses deemed reasonable by the seller will be considered. The audit shall be accepted as a suggestion for resolution.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear process for claims based on an inspection certificate from a recognized bureau. The modified text replaces this with an 'internal audit' and 'discretionary reimbursement,' eliminating the objective standard for claims and creating ambiguity. Instead of a clearly defined 'claim,' it's now a 'suggestion'. This contradicts standard practices for international trade, which rely on objective verification for dispute resolution.",

FORCE MAJEURE: The Sellers shall not be held responsible for the delay in shipment or non-delivery, of the goods due to Force Majeure, which might occur during the process of manufacturing or in the course of loading or transit. The Sellers shall advise the Buyers immediately of the occurrence mentioned above and within fourteen days thereafter, the Sellers shall send by airmail to the Buyers a certificate of the accident issued by the competent government authorities, Chamber of Commerce or registered notary public of the place where the accident occurs as evidence thereof. Under such circumstances the Sellers, however, are still under the obligation to take all necessary measures to hasten the delivery of the goods. In case the accident lasts for more than 10 weeks, the Buyers shall have the right to cancel the Contract.",

FORCE MAJEURE: The Sellers shall not be held responsible for the delay in shipment or non-delivery, of the goods due to unforeseen circumstances, which might occur during the process of manufacturing or in the course of loading or transit. The Sellers shall advise the Buyers when practical of the occurrence mentioned above and when feasible, the Sellers shall attempt to send information by mail to the Buyers, or deliver when they can get to it. Under such circumstances the Sellers, however, are still under the obligation to take possible measures to attempt to hasten the delivery of the goods. In case the accident lasts for a period, the Buyers shall have some rights to consider options.",
                "explanation": "The original Force Majeure clause specifies a clear definition and notification process, including providing a certificate from a competent authority. The modified version replaces 'Force Majeure' with the vague 'unforeseen circumstances,' removes the requirement for a certificate, and weakens the obligation to notify the buyer promptly. The term 'period' replaces 10 weeks and removes any timeline, and the obligations for the seller have become less resolute, replacing concrete steps with softer ones. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard international trade practices for defining and managing Force Majeure events, and it violates Article 79 of the CISG.",

LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty which shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",
                "changed_text": "18. LATE DELIVERY: Should the Sellers experience a delay in delivery, the Buyers may consider delaying the delivery date on condition that both parties find this delay to be mutually beneficial. The amount of late delivery charge will be calculated to be the lowest possible cost and may not be applied. In case the Sellers do not delivery, the Buyers and Sellers will work together to come to a good solution.",
                "explanation": "The original clause outlines a clear penalty for late delivery, calculated based on a specific formula, and specifies conditions for contract cancellation. The modified version eliminates the automatic penalty, making it discretionary and dependent on 'mutual benefit'. It replaces the cancellation right with a vague agreement to 'work together,' removing a critical remedy for the buyer. This directly contradicts the principle of predictable damages in contract law.",

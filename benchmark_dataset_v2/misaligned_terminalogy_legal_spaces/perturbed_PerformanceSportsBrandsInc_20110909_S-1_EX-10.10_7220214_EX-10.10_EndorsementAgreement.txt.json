                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Independent Contractor. Company has engaged North for certain rights which are set forth in this Agreement, and North's relationship to  Company, and Company's relationship to North, shall at all times be that of an independent contractor.",
                "changed_text": "Independent Contractor. Company has engaged North for certain rights which are set forth in this Agreement, and North's relationship to  Company, and Company's relationship to North, shall be considered a service provider but may be treated as an employee for tax purposes.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that North is an independent contractor but might be treated as an employee for tax purposes. This contradicts the legal definition of an independent contractor, which should not be subject to employee-level tax treatment. This creates uncertainty regarding North's actual employment status and the applicable tax laws.",

                "original_text": "Force Majeure. In the event any of the appearances set forth in this Agreement are cancelled or delayed due to matters of \"Force Majeure\",  as such term is defined below, Company and North shall use their reasonable efforts to reschedule such appearance as soon as possible  following such cancellation or delay. As used herein, the term \"Force Majeure\" shall mean war, civil unrest, acts of God, unusually severe  weather, environmental matters, failure of common carrier, governmental action, labor disputes, casualty, illness, injury and/or emergency.",
                "changed_text": "Force Majeure. In the event any of the appearances set forth in this Agreement are cancelled or delayed due to matters of \"Force Majeure\",  as such term is defined below, Company and North shall use their best efforts to reschedule such appearance as soon as possible  following such cancellation or delay. As used herein, the term \"Force Majeure\" shall mean events that Company considers commercially impractical.",
                "explanation": "This alteration significantly broadens the definition of 'Force Majeure' to include 'events that Company considers commercially impractical,' moving away from the typically accepted legal definitions centered on unforeseeable and uncontrollable events. This creates uncertainty because 'commercially impractical' is subjective and lacks a precise legal meaning, potentially allowing the Company to invoke the clause for a wider range of reasons that would not traditionally qualify as Force Majeure.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'Gross Revenue' to 'Net Revenue' and 'all Company Products' to 'selected Company Products' significantly alters the basis for royalty calculation. 'Net Revenue' is subject to deductions and interpretations, reducing the royalty base and contradicting the original intent of a clear, fixed percentage of total sales. Also, it is not indicated how the products will be selected, creating confusion. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes over the definition of revenue and which products are subject to royalties, making the contract less enforceable.",

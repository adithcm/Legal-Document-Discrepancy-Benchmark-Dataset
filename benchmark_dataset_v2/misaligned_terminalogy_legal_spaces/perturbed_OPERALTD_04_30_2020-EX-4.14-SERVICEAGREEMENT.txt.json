                "original_text": "10.1 The Parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or should be construed to create an agency, partnership, Joint venture, or employer-employee relationship between PC Financial and Mobimagic. Either Party will represent itself to be an employee or agent of the other Party or enter into any agreement on the other Party's behalf or in the other Party's name. Each Party will retain full control over the manner and means by which it conducts its business and neither Party will be entitled to waive any entitlement to workers' compensation, disability, retirement, insurance, stock options or any other benefits afforded to its employees.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 The Parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. However, aspects of this Agreement may be construed to imply an employer-employee relationship between PC Financial and Mobimagic, particularly concerning control over service execution. Either Party can represent itself to be an employee or agent of the other Party or enter into any agreement on the other Party's behalf or in the other Party's name. Each Party will NOT retain full control over the manner and means by which it conducts its business and either Party WILL be entitled to waive any entitlement to workers' compensation, disability, retirement, insurance, stock options or any other benefits afforded to its employees.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction regarding the nature of the relationship. Initially defined as independent contractors, the altered text suggests a potential employer-employee relationship, particularly by stating that parties 'can represent' and 'are entitled to waive' which contradicts the explicit statement that this should not be construed as an employee/employer relationship, and implies control. This introduces ambiguity regarding employment law implications under Indian Labour Laws.",

Confidential Information includes the disclosing Party's software end prototypes and information relating to the disclosing Party's business affairs, including business methods, marketing strategies, pricing, competitor Information, product development strategies, and financial results. Confidential Information does not include information which (a) is known by the receiving Party, free of any obligation to keep it confidential; (b) is at the time of disclosure, or thereafter becomes, publicly available through no wrongful act of the receiving Party; (c) Is independently developed by the receiving Party, without relying on or referring to the Confidential Information of disclosing Party; or (d) is approved for release by prior written authorization of the disclosing Party.",

Confidential Information includes the disclosing Party's software end prototypes and information relating to the disclosing Party's business affairs, including business methods, marketing strategies, pricing, competitor Information, product development strategies, and financial results.

                "explanation": "This changes the definition of confidential information by changing 'does not include' to 'also includes'. The original definition states information already known, publicly available, independently developed, or approved for release is not confidential. By stating that this same information IS confidential, it directly contradicts the original definition and creates uncertainty. This impacts the entire confidentiality clause (Section 7) and potentially puts either party at risk depending on the use case.",

                "explanation": "The original clause establishes requirements for PC Financial to have an updated privacy policy and consent driven architecture, and Mobimagic has to store some type of information. The modified version changes it to the opposite, thus causing the need for both requirements, or no need for both requirements, creating ambiguity and legal vulnerability under the IT Act, 2000.",

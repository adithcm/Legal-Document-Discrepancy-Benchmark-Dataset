                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Racing agrees that it will actively participate in the Rolex 24 at Daytona in January, 2010.",
                "changed_text": "Racing acknowledges its intention to participate in racing events at Daytona, but participation is subject to Racing's discretion and available resources.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding Racing's commitment to a specific key event. While the original text clearly states active participation, the modified text makes it discretionary. This contradicts the implied obligation to participate in the Rolex 24 at Daytona and could lead to disputes regarding Racing's fulfillment of its obligations under the sponsorship agreement.",

                "original_text": "Subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, the term of this Agreement and the sponsorship described herein shall commence on  January 1, 2010 and extend through December 31, 2010.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, the agreement’s duration runs from January 1, 2010. The duration may continue past December 31, 2010 if mutually agreed, or earlier by either part as the situation demands.",
                "explanation": "The term duration becomes unclear and contrasts with what is defined in the agreement. Contractual certainty is undermined, which weakens the enforceability of the agreement.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Sponsor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on written  notice to Racing if any driver, the general manager or any other member of Racing (i) fails to conduct himself/herself in accordance with generally  accepted standards of morality, (ii) engages in any activity which reflects adversely on the image, reputation or goodwill of the Sponsor or (iii)  disparages the products or services of the Sponsor; provided, however, the Sponsor shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement if Racing,  within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice by the Sponsor terminates the employment of, or otherwise dismisses from the racing team,  the driver(s), general manager(s) or other member(s) of Racing engaging in the offensive conduct.",
                "changed_text": "The Sponsor may end this agreement if a Racing member fails to meet moral standards, damages the Sponsor's image, or criticizes their products. However, the Sponsor can’t terminate if Racing ends ties with the offending member after notice.",
                "explanation": "The change simplifies a complicated sentence, which alters the effect of the agreement. Now, the term ends, it is unclear how the members will act and what standards should be held to.",

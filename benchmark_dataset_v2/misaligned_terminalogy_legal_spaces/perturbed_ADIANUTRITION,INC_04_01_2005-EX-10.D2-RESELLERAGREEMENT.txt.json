Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PivX hereby grants to Detto a non-transferable, exclusive license to distribute PivX's Qwik-Fix Pro and any documentation supporting Qwik-Fix Pro provided from time to time by PivX (the \"Documentation\") within North America, solely to third parties to whom Detto licenses Qwik-Fix Pro (\"Third Parties\"), and as governed by the terms set forth in Exhibit A (PivX/Detto Reseller Agreement Addendum).

                "explanation": "The term 'non-transferable license' has a specific legal meaning. Changing it to 'transferable' and 'freely transferable' fundamentally alters the nature of the license granted, potentially conflicting with intellectual property law and creating uncertainty about sublicensing rights.",

If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted according to the court's preference, even if it means negating the objectives of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement may or may not remain in full force and effect.

The modified language is that the contract will be interpreted according to the court's preference which may not be the law. The line 'Detto is an independent contractor...' was changed to 'Detto is an employee...' which changes the whole nature of the agreement and leads to a violation of state employment laws.",

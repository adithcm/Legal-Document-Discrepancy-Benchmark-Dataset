                "explanation": "The change from 'all other products...that perform substantially the same functions' to 'all similar items that Hydraspin chooses to designate as Products' gives Hydraspin unilateral control over what constitutes a Product. The term 'substantially the same function' has a legally understood meaning; however, 'Hydraspin chooses to designate' lacks any legal precedent in product distribution and could be deemed an act of bad faith.",

Customer Locations must be available for installation within 90 days of approval by Hydraspin to be applied toward the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmark. All Customer Locations in excess of 25 secured during an applicable 12 month period shall be credited toward the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmark for the subsequent 12 month period. If this Agreement is extended beyond the Initial Term, as hereinafter defined, the number of Customer Locations to be secured to maintain exclusivity during the pendency of the Agreement shall be increased to 50 from 25.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes 'requirements' to 'aspirations,' introducing subjectivity. The initial language created defined, enforceable metrics. The amended language replaces definitive targets with aims, and it replaces guaranteed benchmarks to something decided by Hydraspin.",

The Parties shall use their respective best efforts to settle amicably any disputes, differences or controversies arising between the Parties out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement. However, if not so settled, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and finally settled by confidential binding arbitration, except as specifically provided otherwise herein. The confidential arbitration proceeding shall be held in Collin County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the alternative dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration proceeding shall be held before a single arbitrator unless (i) the matter in controversy exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), (ii) the Parties cannot agree on the arbitrator, or (iii) either Party requests a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and any order of enforcement as the case may be. The arbitrator shall not award any Party punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages, and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right to seek such damages in arbitration or in judicial proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration, and the fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator shall have the right and authority to apportion among the parties all reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, taking into account the relative fault of the Parties. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11.9 do not limit the right of a Party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending resolution of a dispute by arbitration.",

Further, by stating 'The arbitration proceeding shall be held in a location agreed upon by Hydraspin' it is contradictory to the initial statement that the arbitration proceeding 'shall be held in Collin County, Texas'.",

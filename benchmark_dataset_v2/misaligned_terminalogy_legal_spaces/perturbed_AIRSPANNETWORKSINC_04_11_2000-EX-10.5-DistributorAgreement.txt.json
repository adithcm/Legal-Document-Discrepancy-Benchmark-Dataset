                "original_text": "1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.",

Distributor shall have the authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by granting the Distributor authority that is explicitly denied in the original text. Under common law and agency principles, an independent contractor generally lacks the authority to bind the principal (Airspan) unless specifically granted. By stating the Distributor *does* have authority, the contract now contains conflicting terms regarding the Distributor's powers, creating uncertainty about the scope of their agency.",

(This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the established legal definition of a trade secret. A key element of trade secret protection is the effort made to maintain its secrecy. By stating that the information is *not* subject to such efforts, it fails to meet the legal standard for a trade secret. This creates ambiguity in enforcing the confidentiality provisions of the contract, as the information may not qualify for trade secret protection under the law.",

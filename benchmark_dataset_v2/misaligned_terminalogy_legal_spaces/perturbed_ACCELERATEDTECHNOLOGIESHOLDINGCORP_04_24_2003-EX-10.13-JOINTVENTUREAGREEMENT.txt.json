(\"PVSS\"), (the \"Parties\" or \"Joint Venturers\" if referred to collectively, or the \"Party\" or Joint Venturer\" if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\"), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By stating that the parties associate themselves as 'partners' instead of 'business associates', this contradicts the stated intention of forming a joint venture and not a partnership, potentially subjecting the agreement to partnership laws. Pennsylvania law distinguishes between joint ventures and partnerships, especially regarding liability and fiduciary duties.",

Neither Joint Venturer shall be entitled to compensation for services rendered to the Joint Venture as such, but each Joint Venturer shall be reimbursed for all direct expenses, including travel, office, and all other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the operation of the affairs of the Joint Venture and the promotion of its businesses.",

                "explanation": "This changes the agreement to allow for compensation to each joint venturer. Pennsylvania law states that there should be 'equal rights in the management and conduct of the entity's activities'. If the compensation is not equal, this creates a conflict in how the business is handled.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'excluded' to 'included', the joint venture is now subjected to partnership taxation rules under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code. This fundamentally alters the tax treatment and reporting obligations of the parties, contradicting their original intent as expressed in the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Technical Information\" means, with respect to each Disclosing Party, any confidential Data, Trade Secrets or Technology source code within the Nuance IP or SpinCo IP, as applicable, that is in the Receiving Party's possession or that the Receiving Party obtains pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, together with any tangible or electronic expressions or embodiments thereof; provided, that \"Confidential Technical Information\" shall not include information that the Receiving Party deems is or was (i) publicly known at the time of disclosure or thereafter without any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Group or (ii) subsequently made known to the Receiving Party or its Group from any source.",
                "explanation": "The original text has an objective standard of determining what Confidential Technical Information is based on the source and the breach of the agreement. The modified text replaces that with subjective standards, changing the term to \"the Receiving Party deems\" and \"any source\", which creates a discrepancy that can be abused and creates legal contradictions and affects the enforcement of confidentiality clauses. It gives the receiving party too much power to determine what information is confidential, undermining the purpose of the confidentiality agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text includes \"inventions\" as part of the definition of \"Patents.\" By removing \"inventions\" from the definition, the contract now implies that inventions themselves are not covered by the patent protections outlined in the agreement. This directly contradicts standard intellectual property law where patents are granted to protect inventions. This can impact licensing and assignment provisions related to patents.",

The other Party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond or similar security with such remedy are waived.",

The other Party shall oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are adequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is not waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond or similar security with such remedy are required.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for cumulative remedies (specific performance, injunctions, monetary damages). The modification restricts remedies, opposes specific performance, asserts monetary damages as adequate, and requires security for remedies. This is a substantial deviation from standard contract law that favors specific performance in IP agreements. It also contradicts general principles of equitable relief.",

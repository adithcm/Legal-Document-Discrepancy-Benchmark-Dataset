                "original_text": "a) \"Affiliate\" of a Party shall mean any entity, directly or indirectly, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a Party. For purposes of this definition, \"controlling\" (including, \"controlled by\" and \"under common control\") shall mean: (a) ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity capital or other ownership interest in or of an entity; (b) the power to control or otherwise direct the affairs of an entity; (c) in the case of non-stock organizations, the power to control the distribution of profits of an entity; or (d) such other relationship as, in fact, results in actual control over the management, business, and affairs of an entity;",
                "changed_text": "a) \"Affiliate\" of a Party shall mean any entity, directly or indirectly, associated with a Party. For purposes of this definition, \"associated\" shall mean: (a) ownership of at least ten percent (10%) of the equity capital or other ownership interest in or of an entity; (b) influence over the affairs of an entity; (c) in the case of non-stock organizations, the ability to suggest the distribution of profits of an entity; or (d) such other loose relationship as, in fact, results in hypothetical control over the management, business, and affairs of an entity;",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' is based on established legal precedents and ownership thresholds indicating control (typically 50%). Modifying the definition to 'associated' and lowering the ownership threshold to 10%, as well as changing 'power to control' to 'influence over' and 'actual control' to 'hypothetical control' creates a contradiction. This deviates from the legally understood meaning of 'affiliate' and introduces uncertainty regarding which entities are bound by the contract's affiliate-related clauses.",

                "explanation": "The original definition requires the Customer Material to strictly adhere to the specifications laid out in the Quality Agreement, ensuring quality control and consistency. By changing 'the compound satisfying' to 'a substance similar to the compound' and 'specifications' to 'non-binding recommendations', this creates a contradiction. It implies that the material can deviate from agreed-upon standards, undermining the purpose of having specific specifications and potentially violating regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes acceptable material and whether the final product meets required standards.",

                "explanation": "The original warranty requires adherence to strict standards (Master Batch Record, Product Specifications, cGMP Requirements) and assurance of defect-free product. Modifying this to 'generally Manufactured' in a 'fashion that is convenient', referring to 'guidelines' instead of requirements, replacing 'Applicable Law' with 'most Applicable guidance' and describing personnel as having 'sufficient experience' instead of being 'qualified' and admitting the Product 'might have some defects' creates a stark contradiction. This significantly weakens the warranty, introducing uncertainty about the quality and regulatory compliance of the delivered Product and violating fundamental principles of pharmaceutical manufacturing.",

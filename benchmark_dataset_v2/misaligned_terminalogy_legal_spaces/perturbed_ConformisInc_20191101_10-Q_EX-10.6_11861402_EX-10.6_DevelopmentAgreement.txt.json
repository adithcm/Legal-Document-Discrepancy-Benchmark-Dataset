                "original_text": "\"Invention\" means any idea, invention, discovery, know-how, data, work of authorship, information, improvement, technology, process, concept or material, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectable as a trade secret, and whether or not reduced to practice or memorialized in writing.",
                "changed_text": "\"Invention\" means any new device. It can be patentable, copyrightable or protectable as a trade secret, and whether or not reduced to practice or memorialized in writing.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Invention\" is modified to only include new devices, whereas the original definition covers any idea, discovery, or concept. This creates a legal contradiction because the original definition aligns with broader interpretations of 'invention' in patent law, while the modified definition introduces ambiguity by narrowing the scope of protectable subject matter. This could affect the ownership and licensing of intellectual property developed under the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "“Confidential Information” refers to only marked physical documents.",
                "explanation": "Confidential Information in the Asset Purchase Agreement is replaced with only applying to physical documents. This conflicts because it disregards electronically stored information and verbal communications, which are typically included in definitions of Confidential Information, creating a contradiction regarding what is legally protected under confidentiality obligations.",

                "explanation": "Removing the obligation to act without a request introduces legal uncertainty, it contradicts the initial intent of proactively ensuring the agreement's purpose is fulfilled. Under contract law, parties have a duty to act in good faith, and the modification weakens this duty.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.07 Books and Records. All books and records maintained or required by applicable Law to be maintained by each of the Parties  hereto in connection with the Transaction Documents and the GIE, including to the extent any of the following exist: (i) hard  copy and microfiche records; (ii) all paper files; (iii) all electronic images; (iv) all computer data files; and (v) any and all records  in other forms.",
                "changed_text": "1.07 Books and Records. All books and records at the discretion of each party, including to the extent any of the following exist: (i) hard  copy and microfiche records; (ii) all paper files; (iii) all electronic images; (iv) all computer data files; and (v) any and all records  in other forms.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Books and Records' aligns with the statutory requirements for maintaining specific records as required by applicable law. The modified version contradicts this by making the maintenance of such records discretionary. This creates uncertainty in enforcement because it conflicts with the legal obligation to maintain certain records, undermining regulatory compliance.",

                "changed_text": "1.18 Governmental Entity. Any organization that represents the state.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Governmental Entity' includes specific examples such as federal or State courts, regulatory authorities, and State insurance and securities regulators. The modified version replaces the original definition with a more vague and ambiguous description, 'Any organization that represents the state'. This change introduces uncertainty as the precise scope of entities included is unclear, making enforcement inconsistent and potentially excluding critical regulatory bodies.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance 'in all material respects with applicable Law', which is a clear and legally enforceable standard. The modified text changes this standard to 'to the best of their ability,' a subjective standard that could allow parties to avoid obligations by claiming inability, regardless of legal requirements. This introduces ambiguity and undermines the contract's legal enforceability.",

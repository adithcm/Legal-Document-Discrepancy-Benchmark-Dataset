                "explanation": "By removing the requirement of registration after accessing the site from About Network, the definition of 'About Customer' becomes ambiguously broad. This can conflict with data privacy laws that require explicit consent for data collection from registered users. The statutory definitions for data privacy often differentiate between registered and unregistered users, and this change blurs that line.",

                "explanation": "By removing the term 'non-public' the definition of confidential information expands to include public information. This conflicts with the common legal understanding of 'confidential information' which typically excludes data already available in the public domain.

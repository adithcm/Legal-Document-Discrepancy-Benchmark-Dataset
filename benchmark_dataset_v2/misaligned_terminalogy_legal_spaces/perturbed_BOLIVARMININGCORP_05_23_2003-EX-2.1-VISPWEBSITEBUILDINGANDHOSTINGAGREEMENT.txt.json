                "original_text": "This agreement shall be for a term of five years from the date of this document. This agreement shall renew automatically each year thereafter, unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement shall be for a term of five years from the date of this document. This agreement shall renew automatically each year thereafter, unless either party serves written notice of its intention not to renew, on the other at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires 90 days' notice for non-renewal, a standard practice. Reducing this to 30 days introduces conflict because reasonable notice periods are often considered in contract law. Many jurisdictions would deem 30 days insufficient for a significant agreement like this, especially after a 5-year term, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" shall mean information in written or other tangible form specifically labeled as such when disclosed by a Party. Confidential Information shall remain the property of the disclosing Party.",
                "changed_text": "The parties understand and agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement, all documents and invoices and all communications between the parties regarding this Agreement or the Service to be provided as well as such information relevant to any other agreement between the parties (collectively \"Confidential Information\"), may, at the discretion of either party, be considered confidential between KCI and Provider. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" shall mean information in written or other tangible form specifically labeled as such when disclosed by a Party, provided the disclosing party consents to its designation as confidential. Confidential Information shall become jointly owned by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly defines 'Confidential Information' and assigns ownership. The modification makes confidentiality discretionary and changes ownership to joint ownership. This is a legal contradiction to standard definitions of confidential information and trade secret laws, creating uncertainty over what constitutes a protectable secret and who controls it, and would make the contract unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "All questions regarding the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York.  Any controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement that has not been resolved through the informal mediation of the parties shall be resolved through arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, as modified by the terms set forth below: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted in New York state; (b) the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by the parties; (c) the parties shall act in a commercially reasonable manner and speedily select and then conduct the arbitration within 45 days with the expenditure of minimal discovery efforts and expense which shall be determined, if necessary, by the arbitrator. The agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable under prevailing New York law.  Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding and enforceable by any party to the arbitration and judgment shall be rendered upon it in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in New York.",
                "changed_text": "All questions regarding the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York. Any controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved at the sole discretion of the Provider, without need for arbitration or any form of legal recourse. The Provider's decision shall be final and binding.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration under AAA rules. The modification eliminates arbitration and grants the Provider sole discretion to resolve disputes, contradicting established arbitration law. This clause would likely be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, creating a significant legal contradiction and rendering the dispute resolution mechanism invalid. This contradicts fundamental principles of contract law regarding fair dispute resolution processes.",

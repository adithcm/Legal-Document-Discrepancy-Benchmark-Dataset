Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) has become publicly available without breach of this Agreement, (ii) can be shown by documentation to have been known to the Receiving Party at the time of its receipt from the Disclosing Party or its Affiliates without a breach of confidentiality or other improper means, (iii) is received from a third party who did not acquire or disclose such information by a wrongful or tortious act or (iv) can be shown by documentation to have been independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to any Confidential Information.",

                "explanation": "The definition of \"Confidential Information\" has been severely restricted, requiring internal markings and excluding broad categories of information that are typically considered confidential under trade secret law.

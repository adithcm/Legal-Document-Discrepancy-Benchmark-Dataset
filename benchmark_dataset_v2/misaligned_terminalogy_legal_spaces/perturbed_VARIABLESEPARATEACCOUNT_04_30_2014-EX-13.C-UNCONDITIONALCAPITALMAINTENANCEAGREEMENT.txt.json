                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the Company is a life insurer subject to certain capital requests of the insurance laws and regulations of Texas (the \"Domiciliary State\");",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'requirements' with 'requests' fundamentally alters the obligation imposed by the Domiciliary State's insurance laws. 'Requirements' implies a mandatory standard, whereas 'requests' suggests a voluntary or discretionary guideline. This introduces ambiguity about the enforceability of capital standards, conflicting with the statutory intent behind insurance regulations in Texas.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Insurance Code and related regulations regarding solvency and capital adequacy for life insurers.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"Total Adjusted Capital\" and \"Company Action Level RBC\" shall have the meanings ascribed thereto under the insurance laws and regulations of the Domiciliary State, or, if not defined therein, shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the risk-based capital (\"RBC\") instructions promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\").",
                "changed_text": "For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"Total Adjusted Capital\" and \"Company Action Level RBC\" shall have the meanings that the company's CFO deems appropriate, or if not determined by the CFO, shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the risk-based capital (\"RBC\") instructions promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\").",
                "explanation": "The original definition links capital terms directly to legal and regulatory definitions. The modified version gives precedence to the company's CFO's discretion, potentially allowing for definitions that deviate from statutory meanings. This creates a conflict because insurance regulations typically prescribe specific methods for calculating capital adequacy; this modification allows for subjective interpretation.",

                "original_text": "AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"); provided, however, that AIG agrees not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies the corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells the Company to an acquirer, in each case, (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the modification of corporate structure or sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such modification of corporate structure or sale.",
                "changed_text": "AIG shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for any reason with thirty (30) days written notice. No additional restrictions apply.",
                "explanation": "The original clause limits AIG's ability to terminate the agreement, protecting the company's capital and the interests of policyholders. The modified clause removes these restrictions, granting AIG the unrestricted power to terminate for any reason. This is a contradiction, because insurance laws dictate that parent companies have the liability and duty to financially take care of a life insurance company, especially for capital requirements.",

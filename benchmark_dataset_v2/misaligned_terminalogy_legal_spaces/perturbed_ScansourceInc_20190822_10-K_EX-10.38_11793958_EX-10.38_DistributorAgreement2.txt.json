                "original_text": "Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to, and Customer shall not use the Software in excess of, a single hardware chassis or card or that number of agent(s), concurrent users, sessions, IP addresses, port(s), seat(s), server(s) or site(s), as set forth in the applicable Purchase Order which has been accepted by Cisco and for which Customer has paid to Cisco the required license fee.",

                "explanation": "The term 'concurrent users' is a well-defined metric in software licensing, usually referring to the maximum number of users accessing the software simultaneously. Changing this to 'occasional users' introduces ambiguity, as 'occasional' is subjective and not legally defined, thus creating a contradiction in how usage is measured and enforced.",

Customer shall not disclose, provide, or otherwise make available such trade secrets or copyrighted material in any form to any third party without the prior written consent of Cisco.

Customer shall not disclose, provide, or otherwise make available such confidential materials in any form to any third party without the prior written consent of Cisco. Customer shall implement basic measures to protect such confidential materials.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'trade secrets' and 'copyrighted materials' with 'confidential materials' weakens the protection. Trade secrets have specific legal definitions and protections under state and federal law (e.g., Defend Trade Secrets Act). Copyrighted materials are protected under federal copyright law. 'Confidential materials' is a broader, less legally enforceable term. Additionally, changing 'reasonable security measures' to 'basic measures' dilutes the standard of care expected, potentially conflicting with established legal precedents regarding the protection of trade secrets and copyrighted materials.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to specific sections of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) related to government end users and replacing it with 'standard commercial rights' directly contradicts established federal procurement law. 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 outline specific rights and restrictions when providing software to the U.S. government. Simply stating 'standard commercial rights' ignores these regulations and could lead to non-compliance with federal law.",

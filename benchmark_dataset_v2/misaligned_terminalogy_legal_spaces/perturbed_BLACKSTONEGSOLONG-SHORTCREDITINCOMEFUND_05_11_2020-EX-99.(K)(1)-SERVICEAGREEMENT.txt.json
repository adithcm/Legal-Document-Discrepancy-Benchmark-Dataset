                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Agent shall act solely as agent for Client under this Agreement and owes no duties hereunder to any other person. Agent undertakes to perform the duties and only the duties that are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against Agent.",
                "changed_text": "Agent shall act as a representative for Client under this Agreement and owes no duties hereunder to any other person. Agent undertakes to perform the duties that are generally understood for transfer agents, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against Agent.",
                "explanation": "The term \"agent\" has a specific legal meaning, implying a fiduciary duty to the client. By changing it to \"representative\" and replacing 'specifically set forth' with 'generally understood', the contractual obligation is weakened and open to interpretation, potentially conflicting with the statutory duties of a transfer agent.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically regarding the duties and responsibilities of transfer agents.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Client shall indemnify Agent for, and hold it harmless from and against, any loss, liability, claim (whether with or without basis in fact or law), demand, cost or expense (collectively, \"Loss\") arising out of or in connection with Agent's duties under this Agreement or this appointment, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any Loss or enforcing this Agreement, except to the extent that such Loss shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result of Agent's gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.",
                "changed_text": "Client shall reimburse Agent for any expense related to Agent's duties under this Agreement, including the costs of defending itself against any claim or enforcing this Agreement, except to the extent that such expense is a result of Agent's recklessness.",
                "explanation": "The term \"indemnify\" has a specific legal meaning, implying a comprehensive obligation to protect against all potential losses. Replacing it with \"reimburse\" significantly narrows the scope of protection. Also, replacing \"gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct\" with \"recklessness\" changes the standard of culpability required to negate indemnification, contradicting standard legal definitions of these terms.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In no event will Agent be liable for special, indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if Agent has been advised of the possibility of such losses or damages and regardless of the form of action. Any liability of Agent will be limited in the aggregate to an amount equal to twenty four (24) times the monthly administrative fee to be paid by Client as set forth in Exhibit B hereto.",
                "changed_text": "Agent will not be liable for unforeseeable losses or damages. Any liability of Agent will be capped at an amount equal to the total administrative fees paid by Client in the previous year.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific enumeration of types of damages (special, indirect, etc.) and replacing them with \"unforeseeable losses,\" the contractual protection is weakened because the definition of 'unforeseeable' is subject to dispute. Changing the liability cap from 24 times the monthly fee to the previous year's total fees introduces further ambiguity and could contradict legal standards for reasonable limitations of liability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common law principles regarding limitations of liability and the enforceability of damage waivers.",

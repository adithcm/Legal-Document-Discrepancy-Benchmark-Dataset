                "explanation": "By removing the 'Eligible' and 'Supplemental Eligible' designators, this change introduces ambiguity and contradicts any regulations or offering prospectuses defining specific eligibility criteria for account holders to participate in the subscription offering, potentially violating securities laws and fair offering principles.",

                "original_text": "During the period during which the Company's common stock is registered under the 1934 Act or for three years from the date hereof, whichever period is greater, the Company will furnish to its stockholders as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year an annual report (including a balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders' equity and changes in financial position or cash flow statement of the Company as at the end of and for such year, certified by independent public accountants and prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act).",
                "changed_text": "During the period during which the Company's common stock is registered under the 1934 Act or for three years from the date hereof, whichever period is shorter, the Company will furnish to its stockholders when it is reasonably practical after the end of each fiscal year an annual report (including a balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders' equity and changes in financial position or cash flow statement of the Company as at the end of and for such year, certified by internal accountants and prepared in accordance with accounting standards as the internal accountants see fit).",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirements to furnish stockholders with certified and properly formatted annual reports. Replacing the longer period with the shorter period reduces the time frame, Replacing 'as soon as practicable' with 'when it is reasonably practical' adds subjectivity, Replacing 'independent public accountants' with 'internal accountants' weakens the independence, and Replacing 'Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act' with 'accounting standards as the internal accountants see fit' removes the requirement to follow a specific legal accounting standard, which violates securities regulations.",

                "explanation": "By weakening the compliance requirements from 'all material respects with all applicable federal and state laws' to 'all guidelines they deem important' creates a significant legal contradiction. It gives the Company and Association full discretion to the laws, rules and regulations it wishes to follow, which goes against financial regulations and oversight. Adding the phrase that even if they are not compliant, it is not a problem, further reduces the regulatory power of this contract.",

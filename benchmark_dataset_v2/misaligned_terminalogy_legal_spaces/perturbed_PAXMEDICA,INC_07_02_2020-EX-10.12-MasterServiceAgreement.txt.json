                "original_text": "It is understood and agreed that CRO is an independent contractor and will not have any rights to any of Client benefits, nor for any purposes be deemed or intended to be an employee of Client. CRO agrees to make any payments or withholding required by the South African Revenue Service.",
                "changed_text": "It is understood and agreed that CRO is an independent contractor but will have rights to Client benefits as mutually agreed upon in writing, and for purposes deemed by the Client. CRO agrees to make any payments or withholding required by the South African Revenue Service.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that CRO, as an independent contractor, has no rights to client benefits and is not considered an employee. The modification introduces the possibility of CRO receiving client benefits and being 'deemed' an employee for specific purposes, contradicting the established independent contractor status. This creates uncertainty about the true nature of the relationship.",

The modified clause specifies that the agreement is governed by Connecticut law with consideration given to the conflict of law principles in South Africa. This creates a contradiction of how the contract is applied due to the fact South Africa would follow different legal routes than the State of Connecticut.",

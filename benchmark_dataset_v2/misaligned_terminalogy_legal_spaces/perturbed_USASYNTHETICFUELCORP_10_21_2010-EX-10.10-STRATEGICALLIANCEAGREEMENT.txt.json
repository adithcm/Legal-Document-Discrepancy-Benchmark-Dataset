                "original_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means any information not in the public domain, in any form, whether acquired prior to or after the Closing Date, received by a Party from the other Party or any of its Affiliates or advisors, relating to the business and operations of such Party and its respective Affiliates, including, without limitation, information regarding vendors, suppliers, trade secrets, training programs, technical information, contracts, systems, procedures, know-how, trade names, improvements, price lists, financial or other data, business plans, computer programs, software systems, internal reports, personnel files or any other compilation of information, written or unwritten, which is or was used in the business of such Party or its Affiliates, except for information (i) that was or becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of disclosure by a Party receiving such information; or (ii) that is received by a Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party that is not prohibited from disclosing such information by obligation to the disclosing Party.",
                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means information a party subjectively believes to be confidential, regardless of whether the information is in the public domain or was previously disclosed, received by a Party from the other Party or any of its Affiliates or advisors, relating to the business and operations of such Party and its respective Affiliates, including, without limitation, information regarding vendors, suppliers, trade secrets, training programs, technical information, contracts, systems, procedures, know-how, trade names, improvements, price lists, financial or other data, business plans, computer programs, software systems, internal reports, personnel files or any other compilation of information, written or unwritten, which is or was used in the business of such Party or its Affiliates, except for information (i) that was or becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of disclosure by a Party receiving such information; or (ii) that is received by a Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party that is not prohibited from disclosing such information by obligation to the disclosing Party.",
                "explanation": "The added text redefines 'Confidential Information' to include information a party merely *believes* is confidential, even if it is publicly available. This contradicts the accepted legal definition of confidential information, which generally excludes information already in the public domain. This creates uncertainty because it's unclear if a party can claim damages for the disclosure of information generally available to the public, thus impacting enforceability. The definition of what constitutes 'Confidential Information' is significantly broadened beyond what is legally defensible.",

                "original_text": "(d) Consequential Damages. Neither Party shalI be liable to the other Party in connection with this Agreement or the subject matter hereof for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of revenue, cost of capital or loss of profit or business opportunity, whether such liability arises out of contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "(d) Consequential Damages. Neither Party shall be liable to the other Party in connection with this Agreement or the subject matter hereof for any damages whatsoever, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of revenue, cost of capital or loss of profit or business opportunity, whether such liability arises out of contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "This changes the section on consequential damages to eliminate liability for *any* damages. This directly contradicts contract law, which provides for compensatory damages in the event of a breach. Completely removing any liability, even for direct damages, is likely unenforceable and creates a significant legal contradiction. The modification attempts to circumvent standard legal remedies for breach of contract.",

This Agreement, and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder, shall be subject to, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, except that any disputes regarding intellectual property shall be governed by the laws of Nevada, and any disputes related to environmental matters shall be governed by the laws of Ohio.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the 'Governing Law' clause to specify three different states for different types of disputes. While parties can generally choose a governing law, arbitrarily assigning different states' laws to different dispute types (IP to Nevada, Environmental to Ohio) can create confusion and potential conflicts of law issues. The choice of Delaware is also questionable as neither company has a primary presence there. This creates legal uncertainty in determining which state's laws apply to a given dispute. The application of conflicting state laws can render enforcement difficult and unpredictable.",

                "original_text": "2.1 \"Commercial Rights\" means any and all rights of a commercial nature connected with the Arena, including image rights, broadcasting rights, new media rights, endorsement and official supplier rights, sponsorship rights, merchandising rights, licensing rights, advertising rights, hospitality rights and all intellectual property rights in and to the foregoing.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 \"Commercial Rights\" means certain rights of a commercial nature connected with the Arena, including image rights, broadcasting rights, new media rights, endorsement and official supplier rights, sponsorship rights, merchandising rights, licensing rights, advertising rights, hospitality rights but excluding all intellectual property rights in and to the foregoing.",
                "explanation": "By explicitly excluding intellectual property rights from the definition of 'Commercial Rights,' this contradicts the general understanding and legal precedent regarding the scope of commercial rights. Intellectual property rights are intrinsically linked to commercial activities. This could lead to disputes over the ownership and usage of IP related to the Arena. This change affects the scope of rights granted and potentially violates intellectual property law, making enforcement uncertain.",

Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California.",
                "changed_text": "15.10 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state where Allied is headquartered, USA. The Parties submit to non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California.",
                "explanation": "By changing the governing law to the 'state where Allied is headquartered' (Nevada) and making the jurisdiction non-exclusive, we introduce ambiguity. The original clause specified California law and exclusive jurisdiction in Los Angeles. This change could lead to disputes over which state's laws apply and where legal proceedings should occur, potentially violating principles of contractual certainty.",

Each Party agrees that money damages for a breach of its obligations under the provisions of this Agreement protecting Confidential Information and those governing Intellectual Property Rights may be an inadequate remedy for the loss suffered by the other Party and the other Party shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent the breach, or further breach as the case may be, of any such obligation, without limiting the other Party's right to pursue any and all remedies provided in such event by law or equity.",
                "changed_text": "15.5 Injunctive Relief. Each Party agrees that money damages are the only adequate remedy for a breach of its obligations under the provisions of this Agreement, including those protecting Confidential Information and those governing Intellectual Property Rights. Therefore, neither party can seek injunctive relief to prevent any breach of this agreement, limiting each party to monetary damages only.",
                "explanation": "By restricting the parties to monetary damages only, and explicitly forbidding them from seeking injunctive relief, the altered text contradicts legal standards. Injunctive relief is commonly awarded in cases involving breaches of confidentiality and intellectual property rights due to the unique and often irreparable nature of the harm caused. Prohibiting injunctive relief reduces the enforceability of these critical provisions and limits the remedies available to the harmed party.",

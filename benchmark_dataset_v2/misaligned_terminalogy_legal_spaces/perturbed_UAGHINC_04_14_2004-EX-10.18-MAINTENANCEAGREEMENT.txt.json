                "explanation": "By stating the definition will be understood as in the industry, it creates a conflict. The original text defers to the Purchase Agreement for definitions of capitalized terms, which creates a definitive source of reference. This change replaces that with a vague standard ('commonly understood in the industry'), which is open to interpretation and can lead to disputes about the intended meaning of specific terms, especially if the purchase agreement has defined that term differently. In law, definitions must be exact. This weakens contract enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original text sets a standard of 'commercially reasonable efforts' and 'professional and workmanlike manner,' both of which are legally understood benchmarks. Changing to 'use its discretion' and 'what it deems an appropriate manner' replaces objective standards with the Provider's subjective assessment, which creates a contradiction. In services contracts, commercially reasonable efforts have certain legal definitions and expectations. This diminishes the Company's ability to hold the Provider accountable and makes the contract less enforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a relatively clear (although limited) outline for how liability will be determined. It is limited to direct damages and must be proximately caused by the partyâ€™s negligence. This change replaces those legally understood measures with vague and contradictory measures.  The removal of the negligence requirement in (a) means insurance may not cover it. The insertion of sole discretion in (d) makes one party a judge of its own liability, which is not enforceable. This renders the liability section unenforceable and contradicts basic contract law principles by removing clear standards for determining damages.",

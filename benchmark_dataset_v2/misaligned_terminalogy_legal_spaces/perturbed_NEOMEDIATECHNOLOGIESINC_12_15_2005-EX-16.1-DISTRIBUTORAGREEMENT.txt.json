                "explanation": "The term \"independent contractor\" has a specific legal definition, especially concerning liability and tax obligations. Replacing it with \"independent entity\" introduces ambiguity, particularly under PRC law which may have specific criteria for independent contractor status that are not met by a simple 'entity' designation. This could lead to disputes over the nature of the relationship and associated liabilities.",

DISTRIBUTOR is not authorized to make warranties or\nrepresentations on behalf of PPG SHANGHAI and shall make no such\nwarranties or representations. THESE ARE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIONS OR\nWARRANTIES THAT PPG SHANGHAI MAKES, AND ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES UNDER STATUTE OR ARISING OTHERWISE IN LAW FROM A COURSE OF\nDEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY\nOF MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, ARE\nDISCLAIMED BY PPG SHANGHAI.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"PPG SHANGHAI's standard warranty\" with \"PPG SHANGHAI's best estimate of quality\" significantly weakens the warranty. A 'standard warranty' implies a documented, measurable standard, while 'best estimate of quality' is subjective and unenforceable. This undermines the legal protections afforded to the distributor under PRC contract law, potentially violating consumer protection regulations if the product quality is significantly lower than reasonably expected.",

Accordingly, PPG SHANGHAI will furnish certain information to DISTRIBUTOR regarding product safety and handling aspects of the Products, and DISTRIBUTOR, in addition to its independent responsibility to obtain and implement a product safety program regarding the Products, will implement and conform to PPG SHANGHAI's product safety recommendations and Responsible Care(R) Distributor Guidelines, DISTRIBUTOR will also provide its customers, employees and other third parties foreseeably exposed to the Products with appropriate warnings, advice and other material regarding the Products, including all product safety and handling material provided by PPG SHANGHAI, and will ensure that the Products are used, stored, handled, distributed, transported and disposed of in a manner consistent with all of the above recommendations.",

                "explanation": "Changing from 'Responsible Care(R) Distributor Guidelines' and mandatory 'product safety program' to 'suggested safety measures' and 'general safety advice' significantly reduces the Distributor's obligation regarding safety. While the original text aligns with potential chemical safety regulations requiring specific procedures, the modified text makes compliance voluntary and vague. By weakening the guidelines, legal dispute might arise regarding who is responsible for following procedures.",

Without limiting the foregoing, Commercially Reasonable Efforts requires, with respect to such obligations, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such obligation to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) set objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",
                "changed_text": "1.21 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means, with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective (e.g., Development Activities and Commercialization hereunder), the level of efforts the Party deems fit, at a similar stage in development or product lifecycle, taking into account the stage of development or product lifecycle of other of [***] product candidates, safety and efficacy, product profile, cost of goods, the competitiveness of the marketplace, such company's patent position with respect to such product (including such company's ability to obtain or enforce, or have obtained or enforced, such patent rights), the Third Party patent landscape relevant to the product, the regulatory structure involved, the likelihood of regulatory approval, the likelihood and extent of anticipated or actual profitability of the applicable product, and other technical, legal, scientific and medical considerations.

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' includes objective criteria for assessing the level of effort required. The modified version replaces the objective 'level of efforts consistent with the efforts and resources' with the subjective 'level of efforts the Party deems fit'. This gives the party much more discretion and contradicts the standard understanding and legal interpretation of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts', which requires an objective assessment. By omitting the phrase 'who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis', the other party has no way of making sure that the other is performing accordingly, and could be considered a breach of contract. The same applies for 'designed', by removing this, there is no assurance that that effort is adequate.",

                "explanation": "Replaces 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' with 'its best judgment'. 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' is a standard term with legal precedent, requiring objective effort. 'Its best judgment' is subjective, giving Aimmune broad discretion, making enforcement of development obligations uncertain, and is not as rigorous of a standard to impose. This contradicts the implied obligation to actively and diligently pursue development, potentially leading to breach of contract claims.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' to 'its best effort' in commercialization dilutes the obligation, making it subjective. Removing 'accurately and fairly' provides less transparency for how to sell the product and could be seen as false advertisement.

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Company agrees not to knowingly take any actions that would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of Association under section 501(c)(3) of the Code.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees not to take any actions, to the best of its ability, that would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of Association under section 501(c)(3) of the Code.",
                "explanation": "The addition of \"to the best of its ability\" introduces ambiguity regarding the Company's responsibility. The original text implies a strict obligation, whereas the modified text suggests a more lenient standard, potentially conflicting with IRS regulations that require stringent adherence to maintaining tax-exempt status.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code",
                "location": "Section 2"

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with a Best's rating of A+. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage. The insurance shall be in an amount deemed appropriate by the Company.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit requirement for a Best's rating of A+ and the specific insurance amounts, and replacing it with 'deemed appropriate by the Company,' introduces a contradiction. The original text provides clear and objective criteria, while the modified text gives the Company complete discretion, which might not align with standard business practices and could create uncertainty regarding the adequacy of insurance coverage, potentially violating general principles of risk management and contractual obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring reasonable standards of performance and industry best practices.",

                "changed_text": "All materials containing the Association Marks are subject to advance review by the Association. Company acknowledges that the Association's decision regarding the suitability of its Marks is advisory but not binding.",
                "explanation": "The original clause gives the Association final say in approving the use of its marks. By changing 'final arbiter' to 'advisory but not binding' on the Company's decisions, the modification contradicts the intended protection of the Association's intellectual property. Trademark law grants trademark holders the right to control the use of their marks to prevent consumer confusion and protect brand reputation.",

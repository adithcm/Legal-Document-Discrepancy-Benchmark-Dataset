                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof  and, unless terminated as provided herein, shall continue through November 30, 1998.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and continue indefinitely, subject to termination as provided herein.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a clear end date, aligning with standard contract law principles. By changing this to 'continue indefinitely,' it introduces ambiguity about the agreement's duration. Contract law requires a defined term or a clear mechanism for determining the term to be enforceable. An 'indefinite' term creates uncertainty and contradicts basic contract principles.",

                "changed_text": "Logan's shall have the right to use the name of Baker for endorsements, advertising and promotions in all forms of media. Use of Baker's likeness or voice requires separate negotiation and compensation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause grants Logan's broad rights to use Baker's name, likeness, and voice. The modified clause restricts this, requiring separate negotiation for 'likeness' and 'voice.' This creates a contradiction because it implies the initial grant of rights is now conditional, introducing uncertainty about the scope of Logan's rights. Likeness and voice are considered part of name usage, and so this contradicts the original idea.",

                "changed_text": "The parties acknowledge that SRP is acting as a contractor, but the exact nature of this arrangement shall be determined on a project-by-project basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly defines SRP as an 'independent contractor,' a term with specific legal implications. The modified clause creates ambiguity by stating the 'exact nature' will be determined later. This contradicts the initial classification and introduces uncertainty about whether SRP is truly an independent contractor or potentially an employee, which has significant legal consequences for tax, liability, and employment law. This contradicts section 16.",

                "explanation": "By excluding attorney's fees from the definition of \"Loss\" unless pre-approved, we create a contradiction. Generally, under Maryland law (specified in section 7.4), the definition of recoverable \"Loss\" in an indemnification clause includes reasonable attorney's fees. This change introduces ambiguity and could make the indemnification clause in section 2.8 unenforceable to the extent it seeks to recover attorney's fees without prior written approval. It conflicts with the expectation under Maryland law that attorney's fees are typically recoverable as part of indemnification unless explicitly excluded.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the agreement is in force for perpetuity; however, the modified text states that the agreement will remain in force for a 'limited time'. This created a legal contradiction, and adds an uncertainty to the term and enforceability of the agreement. Since the contract is applicable to both parties, it creates a conflicting message on how long it will remain enforced.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'neither party will have the right to bind the other in any way without the other party's express consent' to 'either party will have the right to bind the other in any way with the other party's express consent', we have introduced a legal contradiction. The initial phrase reinforces the limitations of a joint venture, whereas the changed term has now increased liability on both parties, even though there should not be.

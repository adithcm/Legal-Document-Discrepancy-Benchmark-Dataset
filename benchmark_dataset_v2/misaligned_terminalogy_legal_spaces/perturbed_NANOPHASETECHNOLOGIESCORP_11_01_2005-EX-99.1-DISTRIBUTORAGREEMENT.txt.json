                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.3 \"Research Quantities\" means, in the case of nanomaterials and coated nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of 54 kilograms or less, and, in the case of dispersions of nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of 60 kilograms or less.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 \"Research Quantities\" means, in the case of nanomaterials and coated nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of 54 kilograms or less. Quantities of dispersions of nanomaterials for research shall be left to the discretion of ALFA AESAR, but the final decision remains with NTC.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Research Quantities' introduces a legal contradiction. The original contract specifies clear quantity limits for research purposes. The modification, however, makes the quantity for dispersions of nanomaterials subjective and subject to approval by NTC, contradicting the initial definition that established objective standards. This could lead to disputes over what constitutes 'Research Quantities' and undermine the enforceability of provisions tied to this definition.",

                "original_text": "2.1 NTC hereby grants to ALFA AESAR, and its subsidiaries and affiliates, the exclusive right to market, sell and distribute Research Quantities of the Products within the Territory, ALFA AESAR hereby accepts such right and agrees to use its reasonable efforts to promote the marketing, sale and distribution of Research Quantities of the Products throughout the Territory in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement using normal and standard practices.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 NTC hereby grants to ALFA AESAR, and its subsidiaries and affiliates, the exclusive right to generally promote the Products within the Territory, ALFA AESAR hereby accepts such right and agrees to promote the marketing, sale, and distribution of the Products throughout the Territory. The specifics of these efforts are subject to NTC approval.",
                "explanation": "The phrase \"Research Quantities\" was removed, undermining the exclusivity agreement. This change makes ALFA AESAR's distribution rights more ambiguous and dependent on NTC's approval, thereby potentially violating antitrust laws if NTC unreasonably restricts ALFA AESAR's market access.",

                "original_text": "5.1 Return Rights. Subject to the protocol described below, ALFA AESAR shall have the right to return at NTC's expense, and for full credit of ALFA AESAR's cost, any Products (i.) for which a legitimate and credible allegation is made that the use of such Products infringes on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy or publicity, or any other tangible or intangible proprietary or intellectual property right; (b) that are not manufactured, packaged, or labeled in accordance with specifications or industry standards; (c) that are shipped in error or in non-conformance with ALFA AESAR's purchase order; or (d) that are damaged or defective.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Return Rights. Subject to the protocol described below, ALFA AESAR may request to return Products. However, NTC maintains the right to refuse any return requests, and any decision to accept is entirely at their discretion. Any return, if approved, may be subject to restocking fees as decided by NTC, irrespective of (i.) any allegation of infringement; (b) non-compliance with standards; (c) shipping errors; or (d) damage or defects.",
                "explanation": "This significantly undermines the original return rights. By making returns subject to NTC's discretionary approval and potential restocking fees, the clause contradicts the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This introduces a legal contradiction because the initial agreement grants return rights under specific circumstances, while the modification renders these rights unenforceable, violating basic contract law principles.",

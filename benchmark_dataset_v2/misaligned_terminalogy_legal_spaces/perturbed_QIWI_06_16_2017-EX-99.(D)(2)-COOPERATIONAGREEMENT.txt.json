                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person, any other person directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, Controlling, Controlled by or under common Control with such person and, in the case of a trust, any trustee or beneficiary (actual or potential) of that trust and, in the case of an individual, any person connected with him; provided that, for the purposes of this Agreement, neither QIWI nor any of its subsidiaries is to be regarded as an Affiliate of Otkritie;",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person, any other person directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, Controlling, Controlled by or under common Control with such person and, in the case of a trust, any trustee or beneficiary (actual or potential) of that trust and, in the case of an individual, any person connected with him; provided that, for the purposes of this Agreement, QIWI and all of its subsidiaries are to be regarded as an Affiliate of Otkritie;",
                "explanation": "By removing the exclusion of QIWI and its subsidiaries from being considered affiliates of Otkritie, this modification introduces a contradiction. The original definition carefully limits affiliate status, and changing this imposes obligations and rights that the parties specifically avoided. This could affect liability and information sharing under corporate law, and intragroup transactions may now be subject to different regulatory scrutiny.",

The obligations of the parties under this clause 5.1 shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Except as provided in clause 5.2, no party shall, and each party shall procure that their Representatives shall not, disclose to any third party, or use or exploit commercially for its or their own purposes, any Confidential Information. The obligations of the parties under this clause 5.1 shall remain in force for one year.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states that obligations concerning confidential information stay in effect until the information becomes public. Changing this to a fixed one-year term contradicts the perpetual confidentiality that was originally agreed upon. This could violate trade secret laws, which protect confidential information indefinitely as long as it remains confidential.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement specifies that the laws of England and Wales govern the agreement. Changing this to the laws of the Republic of Cyprus creates a contradiction, as it alters the fundamental legal framework under which the contract is interpreted and enforced. This choice of law provision is crucial as it determines which legal system's principles are applied to resolve any disputes, and the laws of Cyprus may differ significantly from those of England and Wales.",

                "original_text": "1.7 \"Error\" means a failure of a Supported Product to substantially conform to its corresponding Documentation (or if there is no such Documentation, to its closest reasonable equivalent).",
                "changed_text": "1.7 \"Error\" means any deviation of a Supported Product from optimal performance metrics, as subjectively determined by VNE.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Error\" is tied to objective documentation. The modified definition introduces subjective criteria ('optimal performance metrics,' 'subjectively determined by VNE'), creating ambiguity. This deviates from standard software contract law where 'error' is often tied to documented specifications, thus creating legal uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "2.6 Response to Problem Reports. VNE shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Converge with an initial response to and status reports for all Problems reported by Converge, and to resolve all Problems identified, in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B attached hereto; provided, however, that VNE shall have no further obligation to respond to or attempt to diagnose or resolve a Problem once it is determined not to be attributable to Errors. VNE will review all Problem Requests submitted by Converge at the Problem Severity Level indicated by Converge unless another Problem Severity Level is clearly warranted. In the event of a reasonable uncertainty, the parties will assume a higher Severity Level for a Problem until they have sufficient information to make a determination that a lower Severity Level is warranted. If, at Converge's request, VNE responds to a Problem at a Severity Level that is higher than what proves to be the actual Severity Level of the Problem, or if VNE's review of a Problem reported by Converge establishes that the Problem was not due to an Error, Converge shall pay or reimburse VNE for all incremental fees and expenses reasonably incurred by VNE in performing such activities.",
                "changed_text": "2.6 Response to Problem Reports. VNE will attempt to provide initial responses to Problems reported by Converge. VNE is the sole determiner of whether issues are attributable to Errors. VNE will review Problem Requests at its discretion. If VNE responds to a problem at a higher Severity Level than VNE deems warranted, Converge will pay additional fees as determined by VNE.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly alters VNE's obligations. Replacing 'reasonable best efforts' with 'will attempt' weakens VNE's commitment. Giving VNE sole discretion over error attribution and severity levels introduces subjectivity and potential unfairness, contrasting with standard contract practices requiring reasonable standards.",

VNE warrants that the Services provided hereunder will be provided in accordance with generally-accepted industry standards applicable to the performance of services of a similar nature. In the event of any breach of the foregoing warranty, and provided that Converge reports such breach to VNE in writing within 90 days following the date of performance of the Services in question, VNE shall, as its sole obligation and Converge's sole and exclusive remedy, promptly repair, replace or re-perform the Services in question, without additional cost to Converge, so as to correct the warranty non-compliance as promptly as practicable (within 30 days to the extent technically feasible).",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Services Warranty. VNE offers a service warranty, but any determination of a breach is at VNE's sole discretion. If VNE acknowledges a breach and Converge reports it within 90 days, VNE may, at its option, attempt to remedy the breach.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear warranty tied to 'generally-accepted industry standards'. The modified clause makes breach determination solely at VNE's discretion and makes the remedy optional ('may attempt'). This contradicts the nature of a warranty, which typically provides a guaranteed level of service and a mandatory remedy for breaches. This change makes the warranty essentially meaningless.",

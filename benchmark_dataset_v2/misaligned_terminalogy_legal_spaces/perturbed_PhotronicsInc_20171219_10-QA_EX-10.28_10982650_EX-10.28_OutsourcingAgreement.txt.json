                "changed_text": "12. \"Purchase Order\" means any of the following (a) an informal request issued to the Company by third party buyers for the purchase of certain Products; (b) a suggestion issued by the Company to a Supplier for a possible quantity of the Product.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Purchase Order\" clearly specifies a \"written purchase order,\" implying a legally binding document. By changing \"written purchase order\" to \"informal request\" and \"suggestion,\" the definition now contradicts the standard legal understanding of a purchase order as a binding commitment. This introduces uncertainty regarding the enforceability of obligations based on these 'purchase orders.'",

                "explanation": "By changing \"all rights\" to \"some rights\", the definition of intellectual property rights becomes ambiguous. This directly contradicts established intellectual property law, which clearly defines the scope and nature of these rights.

                "explanation": "Replacing the specific Incoterms 2010 definition (DDP) with the vague term \"whenever the product will be shipped\" introduces significant ambiguity. Incoterms are a globally recognized standard set of trade terms. This contradicts the established meaning of \"Delivery Term\" under international commercial law. This change creates uncertainty and enforceability issues, particularly concerning risk of loss and responsibility for shipping costs.",

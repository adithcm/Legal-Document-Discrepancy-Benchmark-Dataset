                "changed_text": "Affiliates means entities that the board sees fit.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties 'Affiliates' to subsidiaries or mutually agreed entities, providing a concrete understanding under corporate law. The modified definition replaces this with a discretionary assessment by 'the board,' which lacks a clear, legally enforceable standard. This change introduces ambiguity because the 'board's' discretion is not legally defined, making it difficult to determine which entities qualify as affiliates. This undermines the contract's enforceability by making the scope of 'Affiliates' arbitrary and subject to the board's subjective judgment.",

                "original_text": "Good Industry Practice means the exercise of that degree of skill, diligence, prudence, foresight and practice which would reasonably and ordinarily be expected from a skilled and experienced person engaged in performing obligations the same as or similar to the obligations under this Agreement or any part of them (as appropriate to the context in which this expression is used);",
                "changed_text": "Good Industry Practice means acting in a manner that the acting party deems appropriate at the time of action.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides an objective standard by referencing the expectations of a 'skilled and experienced person,' which is a legally recognized benchmark. The modified version replaces this with a subjective standard based on what the 'acting party deems appropriate.' This creates a legal contradiction because it allows a party to define 'Good Industry Practice' according to their own self-interest, rather than an external, verifiable standard. This undermines the enforceability of obligations tied to 'Good Industry Practice,' as it becomes difficult to prove a breach of contract when the standard of care is entirely subjective.",

                "explanation": "The original definition closely aligns with established legal definitions of Intellectual Property Rights. Adding \"Except, no source code\" creates a legal contradiction, as source code is generally considered copyrightable material and therefore falls under Intellectual Property Rights. This change introduces uncertainty because it attempts to exclude a specific type of IP from a broad definition, leading to potential disputes over whether certain software-related assets are protected under the contract. This undermines the enforceability of provisions related to IP protection, as the exclusion is ambiguous and conflicts with standard IP law.",

It is specifically agreed that all of the power and authority vested to the Company herein shall be subject to any modifications as may from time to time be made by Lessor.",
                "changed_text": "Lessor hereby appoints the Company, and the Company hereby agrees to accept such appointment, as the representative of Lessor, subject to a service fee of 5% of the Equipment's total cost, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for the purpose of ordering and, subject to the conditions set forth in Section's 2.01 and 2.05 hereof, accepting Equipment on Lessor's behalf for leasing to the Company under the Lease from the respective supplier thereof (each a \"Supplier\" and collectively, the \"Suppliers\"). It is specifically agreed that all of the power and authority vested to the Company herein shall be absolute and not subject to any modifications from time to time by Lessor.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agent' to 'representative' and introducing a 'service fee,' the nature of the relationship between Lessor and the Company is fundamentally altered. Furthermore, stating that the power and authority vested to the Company herein shall be absolute, goes against the original statement stating it can be modified, causing conflict in the contract.",

                "changed_text": "The Company is granted the authority to act on behalf of Lessor. The Company must obtain express written consent from the Lessor for any action taken on their behalf.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants broad authority, the edited text introduces the need for express written consent for any action taken by the company. This change now directly contradicts the original grant of authority by requiring express consent, which negates the 'extent necessary' clause and creates ambiguity about the Company's ability to act independently.",

                "changed_text": "The Company's ability to act on Lessor's behalf is unlimited, provided that the Company informs Suppliers they are acting for Lessor. Other rules that might otherwise limit the Company are now considered guidelines.",
                "explanation": "This creates conflict by removing most of the conditions and rules, except one, and by saying conditions and rules are now guidelines.",

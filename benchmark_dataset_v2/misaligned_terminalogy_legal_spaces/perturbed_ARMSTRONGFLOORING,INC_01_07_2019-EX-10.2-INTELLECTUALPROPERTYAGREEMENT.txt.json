                "changed_text": "(t) \"Copyrights\" means registered copyrights only, including approved applications for copyright (excluding, for clarity, Trademarks).",
                "explanation": "The original definition includes both registered and unregistered copyrights, aligning with federal copyright law which protects original works upon creation, not just registration. By restricting the definition to 'registered copyrights only,' the modified definition contradicts federal law, which automatically grants copyright protection to original works. This creates ambiguity as to which works are protected under this agreement.",

                "changed_text": "(x) \"Know-How\" means trade secrets, and other business insights, general knowledge, and marketing strategies.",
                "explanation": "The original definition closely aligns with the legal definition of trade secrets and confidential information, which have specific requirements for protection (e.g., reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy). The modified definition broadens the scope to include 'general knowledge' and 'marketing strategies,' which typically do not qualify as legally protectable know-how or trade secrets without specific confidentiality measures. This introduces a contradiction as these elements lack the necessary secrecy and specificity to be considered know-how under established legal standards.",

                "explanation": "The modified text restricts trademarks to 'registered trademarks and service marks,' excluding unregistered trademarks and trade dress. This conflicts with trademark law, which provides protection for unregistered trademarks based on use in commerce, not solely on registration. By limiting the definition, the contract creates uncertainty regarding the protection of unregistered marks used by the parties.",

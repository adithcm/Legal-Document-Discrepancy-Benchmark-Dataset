                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Sub-Advisor shall act honestly, with due skill, care and diligence and fairly and in the best interest of the Partnership in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement and shall use all reasonable endeavours to perform its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with FSMA, the FCA Rules and any other laws, regulations, guidelines and guidance as may be in force from time to time and applicable to the Funds and their business or to the Sub-Advisor (\"Applicable Law\").",
                "changed_text": "The Sub-Advisor shall act with reasonable effort and diligence and fairly in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement and shall endeavor to perform its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with general business practices.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'due skill, care' and replacing 'best interest of the Partnership' with acting 'fairly,' the amended clause significantly weakens the standard of care required of the Sub-Advisor under UK law, particularly concerning fiduciary duties mandated by the FCA Rules. It also omits the adherence to FSMA and other Applicable Laws, thereby contradicting the specific legal and regulatory obligations imposed on fund managers in the UK.",

                "original_text": "In consideration of the provision of services under this Agreement, Oaktree US will pay the Sub-Advisor such fees as may be agreed between the parties from time to time (the \"Service Fee\").",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the provision of services under this Agreement, Oaktree US may, at its sole discretion, provide a gratuity to the Sub-Advisor, the amount of which is not guaranteed (the \"Service Fee\").",
                "explanation": "Changing the term 'fees' to 'gratuity' and making the payment discretionary directly contradicts standard contract law principles, specifically the requirement for consideration. Under UK contract law, consideration must have value and cannot be entirely at the discretion of one party. By making it a 'gratuity,' the agreement lacks a definite obligation from Oaktree US, potentially rendering the contract unenforceable.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Sub-Advisor shall maintain proper and complete records relating to the services to be provided under this Agreement for such period of time as may be required under Applicable Law, including (as applicable, in respect of the relevant Discretionary Funds) records with respect to the acquisition, holding and disposal of securities on behalf of the Funds, details of all brokers used and the aggregate dollar amount of brokerage commission paid in that regard to each broker.",
                "changed_text": "The Sub-Advisor shall maintain records as it deems necessary, without specific requirements for duration or content, unless otherwise agreed upon verbally.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates adherence to Applicable Law regarding record-keeping, aligning with regulatory requirements like those under FSMA and FCA Rules. The modified clause removes this obligation, allowing the Sub-Advisor to keep records at its discretion and introducing ambiguity. This directly contradicts requirements for regulated entities in the UK to maintain specific records for compliance and audit purposes.",

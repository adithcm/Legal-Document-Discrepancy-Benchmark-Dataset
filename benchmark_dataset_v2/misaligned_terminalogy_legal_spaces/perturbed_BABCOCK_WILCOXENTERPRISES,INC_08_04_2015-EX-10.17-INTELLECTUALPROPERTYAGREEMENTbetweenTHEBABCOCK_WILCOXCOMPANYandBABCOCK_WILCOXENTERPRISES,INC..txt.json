                "original_text": "\"Intellectual Property\" means the rights associated with or arising out of any of the following in any jurisdiction throughout the world: (i) all patents and patent applications, together with all reissuances, divisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, revisions, renewals, extensions, and reexaminations thereof, and any identified invention disclosures (\"Patents\"); (ii) trade secret rights and corresponding rights in confidential information and other non-public information (whether or not patentable), including ideas, formulas, compositions, inventor's notes, discoveries and improvements, know how, manufacturing and production processes and techniques, design manuals, testing information (including testing protocols and results), research and development information, prototypes, inventions, invention disclosures, unpatented blueprints, drawings, specifications, designs, plans, proposals and technical data, business and marketing plans, market surveys, market know-how and customer lists and information, including all tangible embodiments of the foregoing and unregistered copyrights (\"Know-How\"); (iii) all registered or unregistered copyrights, copyrightable works, rights in databases, data collections, \"moral\" rights, mask works, copyright registrations, applications and extensions therefor and corresponding rights in works of authorship (\"Copyrights\"); (iv) all trademarks, service marks, logos, trade dress and trade names indicating the source of goods or services, and other indicia of commercial source or origin (whether registered, common law, statutory or otherwise), all registrations and applications to register the foregoing anywhere in the world and all goodwill associated therewith (\"Trademarks\"); (v) all computer software and code, including assemblers, applets, compilers, source code, object code, development tools, design tools, utilities, library files, user interfaces and data, and all documentation and manuals related to such computer software and code in any form or format, however fixed (\"Software\"); (vi) all internet electronic addresses, uniform resource locators and alphanumeric designations associated therewith and all registrations for any of the foregoing (\"Domain Names\"); and (vii) any similar, corresponding or equivalent rights to any of the foregoing anywhere in the world.",
                "changed_text": "\"Intellectual Property\" means tangible physical objects and the rights associated with them, including books, papers, models, prototypes, and any physical item containing information. This definition excludes intangible rights such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights.  For the avoidance of doubt, software is not considered Intellectual Property under this Agreement; it is merely licensed for use. Intellectual Property does not include Patents, Know-How, Copyrights, Trademarks, Software or Domain Names.",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with standard legal definitions of Intellectual Property. The modified definition intentionally contradicts this by limiting Intellectual Property to tangible physical objects, explicitly excluding intangible rights. This introduces significant ambiguity and potential unenforceability because most intellectual property law focuses on intangible assets.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States patent, copyright, and trademark laws define intellectual property broadly, covering intangible assets.",

                "original_text": "Each Party agrees that it shall make available to the other Party the services of its employees and contractors reasonably necessary to assist the other Party with the prosecution of, and other patent or trademark office proceedings (e.g., reissue, reexamination, interference, inter partes review, post-grant review, supplemental examination, and other similar proceedings) regarding the other Party's Patents, Trademarks and other Intellectual Property (collectively, \"IP Proceedings\"). Each Party agrees to reasonably make available to the other Party (i) inventors and other reasonably necessary persons employed by it for the other Party's reasonable needs regarding execution of documents, interviews, declarations and testimony, and (ii) documents, materials and information for the other Party's reasonable good faith needs regarding such IP Proceedings. The Party involved in the IP Proceedings shall be responsible for the actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such assistance, expressly excluding the value of the time of the other Party's personnel. Each Party will be responsible for providing inventor incentive compensation to its employees under its own internal policies. No Party shall have any obligation to provide any inventor incentive compensation to an employee of the other Party except as required by law.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees that it shall make available to the other Party the physical objects deemed \"Intellectual Property\" under this agreement if reasonably necessary. The Party involved in physically transferring the Intellectual Property shall be responsible for the actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such assistance, expressly excluding the value of the time of the other Party's personnel.  There is no duty to assist with anything else. No Party shall be responsible for the actions of the objects once they are delivered.",
                "explanation": "Given the redefinition of \"Intellectual Property\" in Section 1.1, this section is modified to reflect that narrower definition. The original text referred to 'patent or trademark office proceedings,' which are rendered irrelevant by the redefined term. The modified text only covers the physical transfer of objects, directly contradicting the intent to assist with intellectual property protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States patent, copyright, and trademark laws define intellectual property broadly, covering intangible assets. This section removes assistance for standard IP proceedings.",

Without limiting the foregoing, for purposes of clarity, as between RemainCo and SpinCo, RemainCo retains all rights in and to, and to use and exploit, and including without limitation the right to make, have made, use, lease, sell, offer for sale, and import, and use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, distribute copies, perform and display products and services which utilize or embody such Licensed RemainCo Intellectual Property in the RemainCo Core Field. Except for the limited rights granted in this Agreement in connection with the Licensed SpinCo Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, the rights and obligations arising out of or related to Section 5.10, SpinCo reserves to itself all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed SpinCo Intellectual Property.

For avoidance of doubt, RemainCo does not retain any rights to patents, trademarks, or copyrights related to any object. Except for the limited rights granted in this Agreement in connection with the Licensed SpinCo Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, the rights and obligations arising out of or related to Section 5.10, SpinCo reserves to itself all right, title and interest in and to the physical objects considered Licensed SpinCo Intellectual Property. For avoidance of doubt, SpinCo does not retain any rights to patents, trademarks, or copyrights related to any object.",
                "explanation": "This section emphasizes the reservation of rights related to the redefined Intellectual Property. By explicitly stating that neither party retains rights to patents, trademarks, or copyrights, the modification directly contradicts the typical understanding of IP rights. This creates a situation where the physical object is owned, but the associated intangible rights are not, which leads to significant legal uncertainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States patent, copyright, and trademark laws establish that the creation or ownership of a physical item can often imply or grant certain intangible rights. This clause separates those rights, which is unusual and potentially unenforceable.",

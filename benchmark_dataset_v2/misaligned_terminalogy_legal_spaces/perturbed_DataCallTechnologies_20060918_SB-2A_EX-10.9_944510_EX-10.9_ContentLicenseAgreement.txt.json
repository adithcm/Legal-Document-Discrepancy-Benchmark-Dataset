The modified definition broadens this to \"any type of use,\" potentially conflicting with copyright laws that distinguish between commercial and non-commercial uses and may subject plan_b to copyright infringement claims for unauthorized commercial use if not explicitly licensed.",

LICENSOR indemnifies and holds harmless plan_b against all claims that           Content  infringes any of the above mentioned rights of a third Party.           LICENSOR  shall  pay  all damages awarded in a trial to a third Party.",

LICENSOR may assist, to a reasonable extent, plan_b against claims that           Content infringes any of the above mentioned rights of a third Party.           LICENSOR is responsible only for damages directly attributable to gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear warranty against intellectual property infringement and full indemnification. The modified clause replaces the 'warrants' with 'believes', weakening the guarantee. Furthermore, limiting liability to 'gross negligence' significantly reduces LICENSOR's responsibility, contradicting standard intellectual property protection obligations and shifting the risk of infringement lawsuits and associated costs to plan_b. This creates uncertainty in enforcing the contract regarding intellectual property rights.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that US Law governs the contract. The modified version removes that clause and replaces it with 'principles of fairness'. Also, it removes the guarantee of using courts of competent jurisdiction. This is important because the laws in New York have set precedent and would usually protect plan_b's rights.
